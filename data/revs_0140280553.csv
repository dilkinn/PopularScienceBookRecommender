0,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"Well, it’s really about Galileo. The daughter thing is a hook, and I found that to be the weakest part of the book. Galileo, in this historical memoir, has had three children by a woman not his wife. The daughters are thus unmarriageable, and are sent to a convent. The daughter of the title sends him letters, usually including requests for money. This book provides considerable detail about the travails the great scientist endured in his quest to explain the world. The Catholic Church is the pre-eminent political institution of its time, and thus, Galileo must deal with the reality he inhabits, trying to find ways around the silliness of revealed truth. It is entertaining and interesting. Not a must read, and feel free to skip the letters from his daughter, but a worthwhile read nonetheless. "
1,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,4,"Einstein said of Galileo that he was ""the father of modern physics - of modern science altogether"". We think of him as the father of astronomy. But how much do we really know about his life? The answer, surprisingly, is quite a lot. This book, entitled Galileo's Daughter is a dual biography, both of Galileo and of his eldest daughter, a cloistered nun of the Poor Clares. It is also in part a fascinating chronicle of a 17th Century clash between Science and Catholic doctrine; arguably the most historically significant and intense battle between religious belief and scientific knowledge. Sobel's account is compiled in the main from the 120 letters (translated from the Italian) written by Suor Maria Celeste, which she weaves into her narrative. Sadly none of Galileo's letters still survive, although it is clear that they were in contact daily, and that Maria was his most trusted confidante.Galileo had 3 illegitimate children to care for. Maria (formerly Virginia) was his eldest daughter, and was placed in the convent at the age of 13. The life there was almost unbelievably gruelling to modern sensibilities, but the letters convey how privileged and honoured she felt to be serving in this capacity. The next daughter - also placed in the convent - was a depressive, and Maria attempted in her life to combine her duties as a nun with caring for both of them. She also constantly tried to make peace between her father and her brother. There are numerous details of a simple dish she would have cooked and sent along in a basket, or a garment she would have painstakingly sewn, despite her life of extreme poverty and chronic ill-health. The convent was in bad repair, and the nuns did not have any money. Galileo frequently helped out financially, but the nuns still had to suffer insufficient food, heating or anything approaching sanitation. Maria made light of her troubles, and Galileo was dependent on her loyalty, support and strength, saying that she had an ""exquisite mind"". Although his part of the conversation is missing, it can be inferred, and they were clearly devoted to one another.Galileo was born in 1564, and pursued his dream of studying mathematics and philosophy, despite his parents' wishes that he become a doctor. He taught at the universities of Pisa and Padua, but this position seemed to confer little respect, because of the subjects he taught. However his reputation grew with his startlingly original investigations and discoveries. Eventually he secured the patronage of the Medici family. Among other things he managed to augment the power of the telescopic lens, thus enabling him to study the moon and stars, and discovered the first four of Jupiter's moons. There were further controversial scientific discoveries when he discovered sunspots. He challenged Aristotelian physics, and this angered his colleagues.But the main tragedy of his life stems from the time when Galileo published his ""Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems"". He had thought for a long time that Copernicus was correct in postulating that the Earth revolves around the sun, and with Galileo's mathematical skills and the scientific instruments he had invented, he was able to establish proof. Maria's letters show the wavering stages of approval and disapproval of Galileo's conclusions by the Catholic Church. At first his theories were welcomed, then seen as a challenge to the Catholic faith; the greatest threat since Martin Luther. Eventually the reigning Pope (Urban VIII) - a former friend and supporter - deemed that Galileo had to undergo a Trial by the Inquisition in 1633. By now Galileo was in very poor health. He was charged that his work was heresy; that the motions of the heavens were for the Holy Fathers of the Church to rule on, not him. Galileo insisted throughout his gruelling trial (possibly involving torture) that he was a good Catholic, that his faith was true. Eventually he was released under a form of house arrest, but by now he was impoverished and never really recovered from the experience. The descriptions of Galileo's ordeal is set against a backdrop of bubonic plague throughout Europe, and the 30 years' war. Throughout Maria would care for him, offering constant support and prayers, cleaning and mending his clothes, preparing titbits, tonics and medicines to cheer him. She transcribed all his notes and never doubted his conclusions or faith. She died at 34 of dysentry, only months after he had sold his beloved house in Tuscany to move closer to the convent when his sentence had been commuted to house imprisonment.I was surprised that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. The two main characters are vividly brought to life through the description of events and the details, which are sometimes quite homely, running through the correspondence. Galileo's inventions are fascinating to read about; they are described chronologically as they occur. Both Galileo's brilliant mind and his conscience shine through this work. His struggles to reconcile his scientific findings with his Catholic beliefs are particularly well drawn and poignant, although the descriptions of his trial make for harrowing reading. Throughout there is the devotion of his daughter, who read and commented on his work, sometimes adding thoughts of her own. She was his closest ally. The subheading of this book is ""A Drama of Science, Faith and Love"". It is a perfect description of the book, which itself is a fascinating read."
2,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,5,"What a spectacular book! My advice to you is to violently discard the grossly inferior book you are currently wasting your time with for this one instead. Toss it aside like the trash it is. This is a far better substitute. Do yourself some good instead. The mythology of Galileo, as truly the first modern scientist, is, of course, both revered and legendary. His condemnation by the Church, his cannon-balls from Pisa Tower and his ingenious improvements on the telescope--well known stories, to be sure--are re-told here with fresh insight and clarity. Importantly, though, is that I felt that one can not help but be struck by the contemporary relevance in these stories. The truths that science reveals and the unwillingness that a particular ideology or political group exhibits towards accepting those truths are just as damaging today as they were 400 years ago. Consider Galileo’s cannon-balls: the thinking at the time was that the speed of an object in free-fall was proportional to its weight. Galileo reasoned that it was intuitively wrong to suggest that, from a height of 100 feet, a 100 pound ball would hit the ground, while a 1 pound ball, dropped at the same time, would have only traveled one foot. When he tried the experiment, the discrepancy between the two weights was merely a few inches. As I read of how some of Galileo’s contemporaries’ refused to accept these discoveries, I couldn’t help but draw parallels to the animosity displayed by some toward climate change. Just as some are willing to disregard the overwhelming support of whole hypothesis because of a few findings to the contrary, so too were Galileo critics willing to disregard his whole hypothesis because of those two inches. His response was that they ignored the ninety foot discrepancy the old dogma suggested, to focus instead on his two inches. Yet today so many are comfortable ignoring the facts of climate change, focusing instead on those two inches of debate. And just as Galileo’s two inch discrepancy was due to air resistance, so too will science address all the complex facets inherent in the vigorous and healthy debate of climate change. If it is evolution, stem cell therapies, projected water shortages or the impending energy crisis, so many today are willing to disregard science when it interferes with their comfort. We have not only forgotten Galileo, we have reduced him to a myth, a story only. Someone who played with a telescope instead of someone who changed the world.But, in addition to all this, perhaps even above all of this, the book is a beautiful story of the love between a father and his daughter. Through the surviving correspondence of Galileo’s daughter, a bright yet reclusive nun, we see the esteemed scientist in a whole new way. As a person, a father, rather than an obscure legend. Moving and simple and powerful. All told, this was beautifully done."
3,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612774-sarah,2,"After 150 pages I decided if this book didn’t end by smashing the patriarchy, I didn’t want to read anymore. And since it would end in 1642, I gave up. Say what you will about ‘the times,’ it’s impossible to buy the idea that a well-off, well-educated, intelligent and self-respecting public figure can’t know he’s participating in screwing over half of humanity. Back in the days of Galileo, the author tells us, it was atypical for (male) academics to marry. And so it was with Galileo and his contemporaries, who didn’t marry but nevertheless enjoyed living in conjugal union with someone from the grateful lower classes, and begetting bastard children with them, despite being “devout” Catholics and, in Galileo’s case, personal friends with the freaking Pope. Now if one of your children is a boy, you might, like Galileo, go to the trouble of getting him legitimatized through your political and clerical (hypocritical) relationships, even though he is a sullen and not terribly sharp child. If the other children are girls, bright and dutiful as they may be, put those inconvenient lesser beings in a convent, which operates like an adult orphanage, a workhouse made up of cast-off daughters who live in poverty, as they would in any poorhouse, where they can labor for the church without further ado and through no choice of their own. What is it but a form of white slavery?There aren’t too many books that push my feminist button so bad, but I found it all reprehensible. And to top it off the daughter in question was a fawning and overly loving person with apparently a big forgiving heart that made me want to puke. The other daughter spent her days depressed and in the convent infirmary for want of a sharp object. Quite rightly, in my book. There should be another “Galileo’s Daughter” devoted to the one who was right in the head. If you are really have to know everything about Galileo, you’d probably like this book, which was not uninteresting. As for me, enough was enough and thank God it’s over. "
4,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,3,"So, given the title you'd think this would be about Galileo's daughter, Sister Maria Celeste, who he called ""a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness, and most tenderly attached to me."" Perhaps you might have thought that through her eyes--this account is partly based upon and includes several of her letters--you might gain insight into the mind of the man Einstein called ""the father of modern physics--indeed of modern science altogether."" Given she's described of ""exquisite mind"" perhaps you thought she might have contributed to his experiments or thinking. If you're expecting any of that, you're going to be disappointed. Really, this is a quick-reading biography of Galileo, and there are several chapters that deal with his life before his daughter enters into the story. And given she was a cloistered nun from her teenage years, hers was not a life of wide scope or interest aside from her being the daughter of a famous father. Her letters, though they show a loving daughter who had no doubts about her father's faith, don't reveal a remarkable intelligence--though that would be hard given the letters in the book are filled with little more than such mundane details as grocery and laundry lists and asking Galileo to fix a broken clock. What seemed to have animated the book is Sobel's desire to argue there there is no reason to see science and faith as opposed, and to present Galileo as a devout and obedient son of the Catholic Church, particularly as demonstrated through his loving relationship with a supportive, devout daughter dedicated to the religious life. The Catholic Church both revered shouldn't be slurred with condemning Galileo according to Sobel:""Technically, however, the anti-Copernican Edict of 1616 was issued by the Congregation of the Index, not by the Church. Similarly, in 1633, Galileo was tried and sentenced by the Holy Office of the Inquisition, not by the Church.” Moreover, Sobel related, the Catholic pontiffs who condoned both rulings didn't ""invoke papal infallibility."" Alrighty then, that must have consoled Galileo: who was forced to renounce the Copernican theory, found his books banned, was put under house arrest for the rest of his life--after dealing with the Inquisition and the threat of being put under torture or even burned at the stake--as the Astronomer Bruno had been in 1600 by the Inquisition just decades before. The sad thing to me is as Sobel presented it Galileo had done everything he could to follow Church teaching and rulings. He submitted his book on Copernican theory to the Church's censor--told them to change whatever they wanted to, got a license to print it and the Church's imprimatur. But the Pope was convinced that Galileo was mocking him personally in the book, had him prosecuted, and the book appeared in the next Index of Proscribed Books where it would stay for 200 years. But we shouldn't blame the Catholic Church. Nope, it was all just a ""tragic mutual misunderstanding."" That all reads to me not so much as apologia as satire, yet Sobel does convince me that Galileo truly didn't want a breach with the Church and was a man of faith and science. But for me that just makes more poignant, and more disgraceful, the bullying of an elderly old man by the machinery of the Church.If the book had a strength though, it was how lucidly it explained the science and Galileo's discoveries--just why he can right be called a father of modern science. And after reading some very dense histories lately, it was something of a relief to read something easier that you could cut through like a heated knife through butter. But I didn't think I got more than a rather superficial gloss on Galileo's life and times."
5,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"DNF around 30%. The title of this book is misleading: it's really a book about Galileo and only secondarily about his daughter, who was clearly the Human Interest Angle to illuminate the life of a Great Man. Despite his devout Catholicism, Galileo had three illegitimate children with his mistress/housekeeper. While Galileo had his son legitimized, both daughters were consigned as young girls to a convent, where they lived in abject poverty and struggled with poor health. He did send occasional gifts to the convent (along with his mending and papers for his daughter Maria to transcribe). Galileo's correspondence to Maria has been lost, so we can't learn how he regarded her. However, her letters to him survived and are interspersed with chapters about Galileo's life, scientific discoveries, and the various factions skirmishing for power in the church. Most of the letters involve Maria lavishly praising her father, abasing herself for her own ignorance, thanking him for any small tokens, worrying about his health, and offering occasional thoughts on his projects. While her letters were never self-pitying, I became increasingly annoyed with Galileo, who was too busy staring into the sun and counting spots to properly care for his daughters. The book provides a well-written overview of Galileo's life and discoveries, so if that's your reason for reading, you may very well enjoy it. Personally, I was hoping to read more about the life of a 17th century woman involved in science, so this was a disappointment. "
6,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226514-becky,4,"As the daughter of a physicist, I couldn't resist this book. It is a biography of both Galileo and his older daughter, who was a nun in a local monastery. Her letters to Galileo are the foundation of the book. I enjoyed reading the history of Galileo's trial for heresy and also the day-to-day events that mostly comprise his daughter's letters. A fascinating look into the life of Galileo and 17th-century Italy."

SCIENCE AND RELIGION
My biggest question, after reading this book, is what did Galileo believe?Science has canonized him as one of their patron saints - and rightfully so. The man was a genius. But he was also a good Catholic - or at least he appeared to be. When the church told him to do something, he did it.Yes, the church treated him completely unfairly. And when one is arguing against those speaking with the authority of God, it's difficult to complain about ignorant laws or the injustice of being charged ex post facto.But throughout it all, he apparently maintained some sort of cognitive dissonance. Perhaps he didn't buy everything the church was selling, but he certainly didn't cast it all off either.I was surprised to see how many of these men were devoted followers of God. Not just Galileo, but Copernicus, et al... Because it seems to me Scientists today make Galileo out to be the enemy of the church, and I don't believe he was.Don't take this the wrong way - I'm no enemy of Science. I'm all for Science. But I don't think it's fair to the memory of Galileo to set him up as a propaganda piece. Scientists, especially, should know that the world is much more complicated than that.And, while we're talking about Science, it was brought up that Galileo's most enduring discovery wasn't his star-gazing. It was his use of experimentation. Testing, and testing, and retesting. Taking on the word of Aristotle by proving something. Sure, his discoveries are important - but he changed the way we approach problems - and that impacts all branches of Science - whereas discovering some moons mostly effects astronomy.As for Religion, I found it odd that Sobel didn't talk about Luther more. He gets mentioned a couple times, whereas The Thirty Years War gets brought up often. Part of the reason the church (and when I say the church, I'm talking about the Catholic church here, not the Protestants... they had their own problems at the moment...) was so hard on Galileo was because its authority had been challenged in The Thirty Years War. And yes, that's more in the time-frame, but certainly they hadn't forgotten about The 95 Theses. That was the catalyst.Either way, the church was fighting an uphill battle with Galileo. I imagine one could argue that God was on his side. Science at least was.This brings up one of Galileo's main points. Nature cannot contradict the Bible. If we see something in nature that contradicts scripture, either we aren't looking at it correctly, or our interpretation of scripture is incorrect. He says, ""Holy Scripture cannot err and the decrees therein contained are absolutely true and and inviolable. I should only have added that, though Scripture cannot err, its expounders and interpreters are liable to err in many ways..."" This is THE paradox of a faith that teaches the infallibility of Scripture.At the time, these claims were edgy, no doubt. But even so, I'd contend Galileo was still a good decent Catholic. When the church told him to censor his book, he did. He blacked out ""the offending passages."" Although, Sobel adds that he did so, ""with very light strokes.""This brings me to some last thoughts dealing with censorship.I heard that Stalin censored the same way. He'd outright ban books, or he'd have everyone black out offending passages.And, I know I'm going out on a limb here... I know I'm getting away from Galileo... but this is what really, REALLY worries me about Kindles and e-Books, and i-Pads, etc... That if someone comes along and wants to censor something, with books they have to go one at a time. With e-books, a person can just click - - - - - - - and it's gone. "
8,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,4,"Galileo had a daughter? So what? That question may be raised, which is understandable. Besides, all famous people do procreate, right? What makes Galileo’s Daughter so significant anyway? Well, if you read this book, you surely will change your mind.Dava Sobel again amazed me with her skill in combining history, science and human relations into one book. Not many authors could do such thing, I daresay. She successfully wove this story of a brave, intelligent, resourceful young woman, who had a genius as her father and how both of them relied on each other to live in difficult times. By the way, his daughter was a cloistered nun with the name Maria Celeste. But that did not stop her from being her father’s rock. Her surviving correspondence with Galileo is the main ingredient used by Sobel to describe the dynamics of this unique father-daughter relationship. The contents varied; from her request to Galileo to buy her things such as herbs and linens, the news update on what was going on in her convent, to her consolation for Galileo when he was facing trials in Rome. Not only letters apparently, but she also made him clothes and medicines. It was as though she lived in the same house with him and took care of him. Walls and distance were not barriers. Imagine if they both had Blackberrys.This book elaborates much about his works, including the scandalous Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which upholds Copernicus’ theory that the earth revolves around the sun, which is also a book that required almost two centuries (!) to be dropped from the list of banned books by the Congregation of the Holy Office.Nevertheless, although they did not have rapidshare/mirc/torrent those days, it did not stop the book from being distributed in Italy and beyond. Couriers and diplomatic missions were walking around bringing a copy of Dialogue as they please. Galileo was lucky to have so many admirers in Europe, including even a few high ranking cardinals who felt enlightened when reading his works.One thing that bothers me was that Galileo did his best to ensure that Dialogue would not cause any ruckus. He used the proper channels, consulted to the relevant officials, gathered sufficient supports from prominent nobles and even sought an audience with the Pope to discuss the book! Nevertheless, one could always find a tiny bit of something to be used as incriminating evidence. Galileo finally admitted guilty and let himself (a frail 69 year old then) to be punished. Anyway, IMHO his punishment was not too depressing. House arrest in the residence of a Sienese cardinal who was one of his strong supporters? He could still write, received some guests (some with the permission from the Papal Office) and had correspondence with fellow scientists and family. C’mon, ‘twas not too bad, right?Seriously now, I understand that it was still hard for him. He had lots of enemies who would love to see him rot miserably. The pressure he had to face must have been horrendous. Having your ultimate work - which took decades in the making – banned and that you could not publish anything ever again, must be frustrating as hell. For future readers, please do not be disheartened from reading the scientific explanation in this book. First, there are lots of them anyway (haha). Secondly, they would give the readers insight on Galileo’s personal thinking, which sometimes could be so intriguing and cheeky at the same time.The historical account in this book, describing the flow of events and characters in that illustrious Renaissance era, is truly mesmerizing. The interaction between the states and duchies, the politics inside the Papal court and even the bubonic plague present a thrilling read.Back to Suor Maria Celeste, Galileo described her as a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness and most tenderly attached to him. I guess he realized that she was his greatest treasure and would be thankful if people could pay her a proper homage when thinking about how great a scientist he was. The Father of modern physics would not ‘exist’ without her, period. This is true testament to the adage “Behind a great man, there's a great woman”, am I correct? ;)"
9,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a well researched historical novel about the relationship between Galileo and his eldest daughter Virginia Galilei (1600-1634). Apparently Galileo did not marry Marina Gamba of Venice even though they had 3 children together. The son Vincenzo was legitimized and studied law at the University of Pisa. The two girls were deemed to be un-marriageable so were sent off to become nuns when they were 11 years old. Virginia became Suor Maria Celeste and her sister Livia became Suor Archangela. They were placed in the San Matteo Convent Arcetri of the Poor Clares order. Sobel based the story on the letters written by Suor Maria Celeste and according to Sobel the letters from Suor Maria were saved by Galileo, but his letters to her were destroyed on her death by the Mother Superior to protect the honor of the Order because of the conviction of Galileo by the Church. Sobel also researched the Vatican records, but she presented the delicate religious issues by stating only the facts. She did not go into much detail about the works of Galileo as there are well known and the book was about his relationship with the daughter. Suor Maria Celeste died in 1634 of dysentery. Sobel portrayed her as an intelligent woman well able to discuss Galileo's work with him with great understanding. She apparently proofed some of his manuscripts. I was surprised to learn that she is buried with him in his tomb. The book has relevance today as science is still under attack by political and religious fundamentalist even thought this is not the year 1600. This is an audio-book and George Guidall did his usual magnificent job narrating the story. If you are interested in science or history this book is for you."
10,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s,4,"‘There was only one trial of Galileo, and yet it seems there were a thousand –‘In 1633, the astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was tried and convicted of heresy by the Holy Office of the Inquisition for the crime of having defended the idea that the sun is the centre of the universe around which the earth and planets revolve. Galileo was punished by being placed under house arrest and ordered to publicly affirm his belief in the earth-centred universe. Galileo’s story is the stuff of legend. And yet, there are few references to the support given to Galileo by Suor Maria Celeste, a member of the order of Poor Clares in the Convent of San Matteo in Arcetri. Born Virginia Galilei in 1600, she is the eldest of Galileo’s three illegitimate children and lived within the cloistered walls of San Matteo from 1613 until her death in 1634.In Galileo’s Daughter, Ms Sobel interweaves the stories of father and daughter. Suor Maria Celeste’s letters to Galileo have survived; his to her have not. Ms Sobel writes that his letters were probably destroyed by the Convent after her death:‘In this fashion, the correspondence between father and daughter was long ago reduced to a monologue.’The lives of father and daughter could not be in more stark contrast: she lived within the confines of a convent; much of his life was lived very publicly through his teaching, research and invention. We know about Galileo’s public life, but in this book we learn of domestic concerns, of his daughter’s preparation of pills and potions for his illness, of her mending and sewing for him and of preparing food for him. We learn as well that Galileo was a generous benefactor of the Convent, and that Suor Maria Celeste served as an apothecary and was sought out by the abbesses to write important letters.Although the title of the book is ’Galileo’s Daughter’ and the focus is on Suor Maria Celeste, it is Galileo’s life that occupies centre stage. Suor Maria Celeste’s letters provide another and different insight into Galileo’s life as well as raising quite a few questions about the treatment of daughters (especially illegitimate daughters in the 17th century). I admit that my primary focus was on Galileo, but I found myself liking Suor Maria Celeste and wanting to know more about her. This book brings them both to life.‘Thus, to imagine an infinite universe was merely to grant almighty God his proper due.’Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
11,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223993-anne,2,"This is a biography of Galileo, told in part through letters written to him by his illegitimate daughter, a cloistered nun and Galileo's confidante. Over 125 letters written by her survive, though all of the letters from Galileo to his daughter have reportedly been lost or destroyed. While the familial relationship was interesting, I didn't feel as if the correspondence added much to the narrative, and it seemed as if most of the biographical information about Galileo came from other sources. As I am not particularly interested in astronomy, mathematics, or physics, I found most of the discussion of Galileo's findings and research a bit boring (I know it's all incredibly important and I respect that, I just don't care to read about it). I was interested in Galileo's treatment by the church, but at this point I feel like most of that information is common knowledge, and I almost felt as if Sobel's retelling of the story was like reading a high school textbook. I was unimpressed by her writing, and felt as if the use of the letters was too gimmicky - a way to appear to have a new angle on Galileo's life, but not really adding much overall. That being said, a very well-read friend of mine who reads biographies by the dozen loves this book - and feels that it was most certainly deserving of all the praise it has received. More science-minded individuals would probably enjoy it."
12,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2320578-erin,2,"I was really disappointed in this book. I knew when I purchased it that it wasn't actually about Galileo's daughter, that the story was almost entirely Galileo's. Still, I figured the the father/daughter relationship would provide some important framework for the story. It didn't really. This is a fairly dry biography of Galileo and the personal and professional events that shaped his life. There's not much more to it.In the book, Galileo's daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, having been consigned to a convent as a preteen, is now a nun who rarely sees her father and communicates with him via letters. Her letters to him have survived and many are included in the book, but they don't shed as much light on Galileo's life as I'd hoped. I got really, really bored with the narrative, which was a very straightforward telling of the events of Galileo's life. In my opinion, nonfiction is always best when it reads like a novel and not like a history book. Unfortunately, this was a history book. I didn't enjoy the read and didn't take much away from it. It was a disappointment."
13,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863991-beth,4,"I think I prefer this book to Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time which is also good, but not quite as captivating.Galileo's oldest child, born of his illicit liaison with the beautiful Marina Gamba of Venice, was thirteen years old when he placed her at the Convent of San Matteo in Arcetri. He never married her mother, so he thought that the girl would be unmarriageable. Her given name was Virginia (after Galileo's sister), but when she became a nun, she adopted the name Maria Celeste, a name inspired by her fathers work in astronomy (as in celestial). She was part of the Order of St. Clare, a contemplative order of nuns known as the Clarrises, or the Poor Clares. The order was named for the first female follower of St. Francis of Assisi. She initiated the tradition of work in the convents, filling the hours between daily offices with spinning and embroidery. The rules of the order enforced a very ascetic existence even compared to other convents, as all Poor Clares were dependent on alms. Galileo frequently sent financial assistance to the convent, but it was still a very difficult way to live. The book includes many excerpts from Maria Celeste's letters to her father, of which 124 letters survive. Although they wrote to each other frequently, Galileo's side of the correspondence has not been preserved. Galileo began his career as a professor of mathematics, but the work in astronomy for which he is best known began when, in 1609, he became the first person to point a telescope skyward. The telescope revealed previously unseen features on the moon, a closer view of the Milky Way than could be seen with the naked eye (revealing its dense clusters of stars), and the first four moons of Jupiter. For these discoveries, he won appointment as chief mathematician and philosopher at the court of Cosimo de Medici in 1610. He published a book, The Starry Messenger, describing his observations. It sold out within a week of publication.In letters to his former student Benedetto Castelli and to the Duchess Christina (daughter of Charles III of Lorraine) Galileo explained why he thought that the heliocentric view of universe was not in conflict with scripture. The first letter became widely circulated and a Dominican friar who heard about it, Tommaso Caccini, arrived at the Inquisition's offices in Rome to denounce Galileo for heresy. At the end of 1615, Galileo traveled to Rome hoping to clear his name of the suspicion of heresy. In 1616, Galileo was warned to curtail his studies of the motions of heavenly bodies and told that the subject was best left to the fathers of the Church. For seven years he obeyed, turning his attention to other issues, such as using the moons of Jupiter to calculate longitude and developing a compound microscope with which he observed insects. In 1623 a new pope, Pope Urban VIII, took office. Galileo knew him personally; he had demonstrated his telescope to him and discussed the physics of floating bodies with him at a banquet at the Florentine court. So Galileo hoped that under the new pope, he would be allowed to return to the study of astronomy, and he decided to proceed with his plans to write a book on the two rival theories of cosmology, the sun-centered and the earth-centered. This book was the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, published in 1632. The following year, Galileo was brought in for questioning by the Inquisition. He was tried and convicted of heresy, imprisoned, and eventually released under a revised sentence of house arrest. He then sold his home in Tuscany in order to move closer to the Convent of San Matteo and serve his time under house arrest there, but a few months later she fell ill and died of dysentery at the age of 34. I really enjoyed this, mostly for the narrative itself, but also because of the author's narration, which includes asides like this one on Galileo's experiments: Although this account reveals stunning experiments that promise to open a new window on philosophy, Salviati cannot be shaken from his recently acquired pedantic monotone, which threatens to establish an irreparable split, if not between science and religion, then between science and poetry. I listened to most of this on audio, but I also had a library copy of the ebook, both checked out from OverDrive."
14,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862584-mike,5,"It seems ludicrous in today's age of technology and incremental achievements that one man could ever accomplish as much as Galileo, who discovered almost half of the planets we know of today and rubbished claims held scientifically for thousands of years.Galileo Galilei was born into a time and a place that could not have been more perfect for him. At the turn of the 17th century, much of Europe had already cast off the oppressive cloak of ignorance held fast by the Catholic Church for the previous millennium. In Italy, Florence had given birth to the Renaissance and was spearheading the drive towards new knowledge. This was an age in which Galileo would be able to meet such luminaries as Rene Descartes, Thomas Hobbes and John Milton, to name but the best known internationally among them.During his more than seventy years he pushed the boundaries of astronomy, philosophy and physics in a way unseen since the days of Aristotle, adapting the telescope and discovering several planets, pushed ideas that would be the basis on which Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein would work. And into that life stepped the overbearing, insecure Pope Urban VIII, who would ban Galileo from teaching and printing any of his ideas, since his work was 'contrary to Scripture'.It is difficult for anyone with an enquiring mind, a sense of freedom or justice or even a passing interest in science not to become angry to the point of rage at the story of Galileo's life. So much more could have been achieved and discovered had he been allowed by the neurotic idiots at the Vatican to continue his work. That organisation - which, I might add, decried Italy's burgeoning railway network in the mid-19th century in the same terms - did not see fit to 'pardon' Galileo until the 1980s - the NINETEEN-EIGHTIES.What comes from a reading of this book is an enormous amount of respect for Galileo Galilei, fury at the wilfully ignorant buffoons who would have us living in the Stone Age that they may remain in power, and love for the depth of feeling he shared with his daughter. Galileo remained as good a Christian as any whilst the captains of that religion sought to rid the world of his findings. The letters he received from his daughter (his to her have not survived) show a huge love worthy of a story in its own right.In the end, Grand Duke Ferdinando of Florence, though banned from giving Galileo anything but the most basic of burials, called him ""the greatest light of our times"". “Today the news has come of the loss of Signor Galilei,” wrote Lucas Holste, Francesco Cardinal Barberini’s Vatican librarian, ""which touches not just Florence but the whole world, and our whole century which from this divine man has received more splendor than from almost all the other ordinary philosophers. Now, envy ceasing, the sublimity of that intellect will begin to be known which will serve all posterity as guide in the search for truth.”And so it is that the forces of blindness, corruption and silence have entered the 21st century in disgrace while Galileo Galilei is held among the greatest of men ever to have lived; a calming and reassuring thought if ever there was one.This is a wonderfully written book which takes an interesting angle of approach and succeeds entirely. Sobel's narrative, thorough and full of explanation for the less scientifically knowledgeable, is easy to read and even poetic in places."

Thus is the life of Suor Maria Celeste. Only finding a little happiness may be in knowing the happiness and contentment of those she loved and served. I am sure many a girl/women of human history has done so, willingly or unwillingly..Still I find it shocking that even the light of a very enlightened father cannot reduce the darkness of ignorance and disparity from his own house. To all the women who sacrificed their lives one way or another, believing this to be necessary for making others' lives happy or comfortable or livable; I hope it was worth it, for its such a high price to pay; and I hope life honors your sacrifices and gives you some acknowledgement even if its after 500 years and in a book.Galileo was the Prometheus of his time. An extraordinary mind, wit and perception. In the end he was punished for it.Very interesting book that recaptures the circumstances, the dynamics of that era. A book that makes one feel grateful for being born in our time.“The arduous existence of the Poor Clares was described baldly by a contemporary of Suor Maria Celeste’s and Suor Arcangela’s— Maria Domitilla Galluzzi, who entered the house of the Clarisses in Pavia in 1616, and later wrote her own interpretation of the Rule of Saint Clare.“Show her how we dress in vile clothing,” Maria Domitilla counseled any nun introducing a candidate for admission to the sisters’ way of life, “always go barefoot, get up in the middle of the night, sleep on hard boards, fast continually, and eat crass, poor, and lenten food, and spend the major part of the day reciting the Divine Office and in long mental prayers, and how all of our recreation, pleasure, and happiness is to serve, love, and give pleasure to the beloved Lord, attempting to imitate his holy virtues, to mortify and villify ourselves, to suffer contempt, hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and other inconveniences for his love.”---“Suor Maria Celeste’s word for the loving indulgence that characterized her father’s attentiveness—amorevolezza—appears more than twenty times in her 124 surviving letters, thanking him for some recent act of thoughtfulness or generosity toward herself, her sister, or someone else in the convent. Thus, all the while that Galileo was inventing modern physics, teaching mathematics to princes, discovering new phenomena among the planets, publishing science books for the general public, and defending his bold theories against establishment enemies, he was also buying thread for Suor Luisa, choosing organ music for Mother Achillea, shipping gifts of food, and supplying his homegrown citrus fruits, wine, and rosemary leaves for the kitchen and apothecary at San Matteo.”“Meanwhile, Austrian Hapsburg troops fighting in Mantua inadvertently released a biological weapon along with their musket fire, by carrying the bubonic plague across the Alps into Italy in 1629. Urban, as part of his program to protect the populace from this threat, now traveled clear across Rome every Sunday to say mass at the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, where a treasured image of the Madonna had miraculously barred the plague from the city in the sixth century”“Suor Maria Celeste further nursed Galileo by plying him with every new plague preventative she could fabricate in her apothecary shop or procure by other means. ”Excerpt From: Dava Sobel. “Galileo's Daughter.” Apple Books."
16,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4658045-paul,5,"This is an amazing book, and just the thing to cleanse the mental palate after inflicting Nancy Kress' An Alien Light on myself. Galileo's story is really at the crux of the transition from Aristotelian physics to what we now call Newtonian or classical physics. It was Galileo and his contemporaries who finally broke the stranglehold that Aristotle had on philosophy in the West and improved on him. Today we are generally told a very few things about Galileo:- He was essentially the first to use a telescope on the night sky and observe new phenomena, such as the moons of Jupiter or the roughness of the moon or a dim impression of Saturn's rings.- He was condemned by the Catholic Church for espousing Copernicus' hypothesis that the Earth circles the Sun and that the daily motion of celestial objects is caused by the Earth's rotation, rather than the motion of Aristotle and Ptolemy's spheres.That's all I knew about him for many years. I had grasped more details in the last several years before reading this book, but it gives me an overflowing wealth of information about his life and a much better idea of the history and details of the controversy that led to his trial in Rome. Obviously I recommend anyone and everyone read this book for themselves and get these details.I actually saw this author speak, largely about this book, in Indianapolis in 2008 or 2009, so I snapped the book up right away when I saw it at a used bookstore in Honolulu (overcrowded baggage be damned). What I find most amazing is that this woman is Jewish, yet she sympathetically advances the thesis that Galileo was throughout his life a staunch Catholic who made himself enemies by his sharp wit and criticism of establishment (i.e. Aristotelian, which was nearly everyone at the time) academics, who were able to bring about his condemnation after many years, while he retained many friends, also intellectually committed Catholics, who were convinced of his sincerity and that his interpretations of his discoveries were perfectly reconcilable with the faith.I will end by noting that Galileo's Daughter is his eldest daughter, an intelligent and committed Poor Clare with whom Galileo corresponded often. Most of the correspondence Dava included in the book is about the daily human affairs of early seventeenth century Italy and gives a comforting picture of the humanity of both Galileo, Suor Maria, and the people around them."
17,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906185-kaara,3,"This book was clearly a labor of love, well researched and with sympathetic, very human depictions of Galileo, his daughter Sister Maria Celeste, and other folks. I learned a lot about Galileo's unbelievable discoveries, his equally important and forward-thinking contributions to the scientific community in terms of process and rigor, his family, and the politics, culture, and technology of the times he lived in. All very interesting. But the angle of this book, of Galileo's life being viewed through the eyes of his daughter, who shared his enormous intellect and capabilities and with whom he had a loving relationship, didn't really...work. Intelligent and accomplished as she seemed to be, she was a cloistered nun her entire (short) life, and, while her letters to Galileo survived, his letters to her did not; both these factors limited Maria Celeste as a main player in the narrative, despite the author's efforts. Nevertheless, a fascinating and inspiring story (and sobering--seems that every era has its folks who would rather hurt people than accept a change in common knowledge)."
18,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,2,"This was a biography of Galileo. His daughter figures into it only because the author reprints letters that she sent her father from her convent (where he shipped her off to become a cloistered nun at age 13). This was OK -- I felt sooooo bad for Galileo having to fold before the inquisition and renounce his belief that the earth rotates around the sun---but it just wasn't nearly as good as the last book I read by this author, Longitude. Highly recommend the latter, but this one, while interesting, is a bit of a slog."
19,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9464013-david,4,"4.5 stars. A fascinating walk through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, as well as an exploration of how much of a key figure his cloistered daughter was in his life. It's aimed at a popular audience, and is very readable, even enthralling. I was engrossed in the story, and the characters were brought to life well.Given the actions of some in the church, it's also written from a considerate and sympathetic point of view towards the Catholic church. This feels right, because of the faith of Galileo himself. The book is also thought-provoking in this regard. There are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them. It also inspired me to go have a look at the sky for myself!Highly recommended for those interested in Galileo, astronomy, history of science, church history, or the interaction between science and faith."
20,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6015709-pallavi-gambhire,3,"""Galileo's daughter"" is the biography of the great philosopher and astronomer, with some loving letters by his daughter interspersed throughout the narrative. I have been reading a lot of biographies lately (something I had sworn, I would never have an interest in), and this one is unique because it primarily focuses on the relationship between Galileo and his daughter and is essentially a biography of both of them.  Sobel presents a very vivid description of Galileo's life, his trials and tribulations, the consolations his daughter provided through his tough times and very often,a claustrophobic view of Maria Celeste's life as a cloistered nun. The letters by themselves aren't extremely interesting (except for Suor Maria Celeste's acknowledgement of Galileo as ""Most illustrious Father"" or ""Most beloved and illustrious Father""! I mean how many of us refer to our dear dad this way anymore!). They present the day to day banality of the convent life, her hardships, her constant demands for material and monetary support from her father, her resignation at not being as intelligent as her father and lauding his merits, while constantly asking for advice (That is extremely modest of her, considering it was she who finished his final manuscripts for him). While the letters brought a relatively unknown person to life, and showed Galileo as a loving father, they did break up the narrative often enough to annoy me after a certain point. Galileo placed his two young daughters at the San Mateo convent, where they devoted themselves to the lives of cloistered nuns and lived their lives in abject poverty, despite the loving financial and emotional support of their father. The older daughter took upon the name 'Maria Celeste' as an ode to her father's devotion to celestial objects and it is through her letters that we get a glimpse of a daughter's relationship with her famous father, and their loving support to each other. Unfortunately for us,Galileo's replies to his daughter were never found. Therefore,what could have been a incredible dialogue between the two, is reduced to a disparate monologue of letters, in which a daughter keeps asking her father for financial help and in return provides him with love and unconditional support in the light of his run-ins with the Church. It made me think of( and be thankful for) the ease with which the world communicates now, and it was rather unnerving to think of the number of days (or even weeks) Galileo and Suor Maria Celeste must have waited to get their letters. It also made me lament the lost art of writing such long heartfelt letters what with modern communication lingo that includes abbreviations such as ""XOXO"", ""<3"", ""Waddup"" in the interest of time. People keep in touch often and therefore have the liberty to shorten their communication! (Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, anyone?)Anyway,I thought ""Galileo's daughter"" was an interesting, well researched book that portrayed Galileo as a man of science who defied the Church, while being deeply religious at the same time and who tried to reconcile the two all his life. At the end of it, you might notice that people have been struggling for the same things through the centuries. Unrighteous censorship, religious freedom and the right to free speech to name a few. "
21,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8110256-tom,2,"It's okay as far as it goes but I kept feeling frustrated when Sobel passed up opportunity after opportunity to shed more light on some fascinating aspect of Galileo's life and times, I suspect through shallowness of research. It was like taking a guided tour of some great historical building, only for the guide to rush you past the most interesting looking rooms.The idea of using his daughter's letters is a very good one and serves to add context for the cares of everyday life and the ways of seeing the world which surrounded Galileo, but in many other respects we are left with too little information.For example, we are told he greatly improved the spyglass and developed it into the telescope. How? What did he do that other people didn't? What work had already been done on this technology? Was he working on his own or with the glassmakers of Murano? A few paragraphs of context may have been all that was needed but we are given nothing. In fact, a lot of the actual science concepts seem to be skimmed. If I didn't know she had made a career of writing about the history of science, I'd have said she didn't actually seem to understand the fundamental concepts around which Galileo made his great contributions.We are told he was both internationally famous and that he had enemies well before he got into the controversy over his Dialogue. Why? On what was his fame based? What were his detractors saying and why? Generally we are left with little context of the intellectual life of the time which is sorely needed to understand how Galileo both fit into and diverged from it. Near the end of the book, it is mentioned that the poet John Milton visited Galileo, a fact which another biographer would have seen as a golden opportunity to wax lyrical, perhaps bringing in the international context and the consequences of the church's censorship of his ideas. Sobel decided that the meeting of two of the most significant figures of their age is only worthy of a parenthesis and a footnote.Overall, it reads like the work of someone who has just done research towards an essay, and therefore skims the parts which she hasn't looked into enough to develop a real understanding of. I would rather read a biography by someone who has a deep knowledge of her subject and can really immerse me in the world she is describing."

Last year I read Nathaniel's Nutmeg, a book that has forever changed my perspective about paying $2 for a jar of nutmeg at the grocery store. This year I selected Galileo's Daughter. I admit, I didn't know much about the man other than that he was the father of modern sciences and was censored by the Catholic church, but I didn't know the details of that.[return][return]This book takes a fascinating approach to Galileo by studying him through his eldest daughter's eyes. He had three children--all illegitimate--with the two girls placed in a convent. The eldest, dubbed Suor Maria Celeste as a nun, had all of the intelligence and wit of her father. She managed many aspects of her convent, and while her father was imprisoned by the Inquisition, she also ran her father's household--even though she could not leave the convent grounds. This book delves heavily into Galileo's Dialogues, a volume that earned him the acclaim of his fellow scientists and the scorn of the Pope (his former friend), and resulted in his prolonged captivity during a time of virulent plague.[return][return]I'm very glad I read this, though at times it was challenging for me. I do not share Galileo's scientific mind, and I'm awed at the discoveries and observations he made with the tools at his disposal. I adored Maria Celeste's letters. Her voice is delightful and bright, always drawing heavily on her faith while supporting her father to the utmost. It's no wonder that Galileo was crushed by her death at age 34. Galileo's own long life of 77 is quite remarkable; up to the very end, despite blindness and incapacitating pain, he dictated new theories to his apprentice.[return][return]I highly recommend this book."

25,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Galileo’s Daughter was written by Dava Sobel in 1999. This book is first and foremost a historical narrative about Galileo. Galileo never married which was not uncommon amongst the educated class. Of his many children he was closest to his daughter Virginia, the daughter referenced in the title of the book, and his son Vivencio. Through her father’s influence Virginia became a nun at a convent near Florence. The author had access to a large number of letters that Virginia wrote to her father over decades and included many in the book, thus the title.Sobel’s narrative approach definitely helps adds a human element to the story through Galileo’s correspondence with his daughter.Most of the scenes in the book are set in Pisa, Florence or Rome. All places integral to Renaissance history and extremely interesting in their own right. Also covered in the book are the periods including the Bubonic plague, the Thirty Years War and an epidemic of food shortages in Florence. Highly dramatic events.Galileo Galilei was born in Pisa, Florence in 1564. His father was a mathematician of local renown. Galileo when he came of age was unable to secure a spot to attend the university at Pisa so he took up a tutorship for the powerful Medici family. His brilliance quickly became known and he was then able to secure a professorship at Pisa in mathematics. It was also at this time that Galileo became close to Pope Paul V who supported his scientific research. Galileo contributed mightily to the canon of scientific discovery. In 1611 he expanded on a new compound eyeglass invention to become the first to use a telescope for astronomy. In short order he examined the moon in detail, explored sunspots and the Jovian giants and published his results. This disturbed many in the church who viewed the sun and moon as perfect heavenly bodies. Fortunately for Galileo, the Pope seemed more intrigued with the findings than dismayed.It was around this time that Galileo performed his famous experiment proving that gravity acted equally on light and heavy objects. His demonstration involved dropping a cannonball and a smaller musket ball from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He proved that they would drop at the same speed and hit the ground at the same time. This was seventy-five years prior to Newton’s publication of Principia by the way.Through Galileo’s astronomical research, including observations of comets and his gravity experiments Galileo confirmed for himself that the heliocentric theory introduced by Copernicus some sixty years earlier was indeed correct. Kepler also independently came to this conclusion at the same time as Galileo.Of course the Catholic Church did not believe in the heliocentric theory. Their dogma placed the earth at the center of the universe. But Galileo chipped away at the edges. Although he did not explain in the cogent mathematical equations that Newton would outline later, Galileo explained that because the perception of velocity was relative to the earth we can’t feel the “effects” of the heliocentric theory. He acknowledged that there was no test that he could devise to prove this. So this disconnect remained an impediment to belief in the theory amongst those who were not astronomers or mathematicians, especially in the shadow of the Catholic church’s position. Galileo’s troubles with the church really began after his publication of Dialogue in 1623 which also occurred when Urban VIII assumed Pontifex Maximus. Although the new Pope was not hostile to Galileo he was hostile to the heliocentric theory. It took a decade for Galileo’s enemies to bring charges. While Galileo was spared the ultimate sentence by Urban VIII he did serve six months and was banned from discussing his scientific findings. He lived on for another decade and although he did continue to discuss his theories he maintained a much lower profile. Galileo was buried in the Santa Croce church in Florence with his daughter Virginia and his close assistant Viviani. He lived a long life and until that last decade, he had managed to thread the needle between science and blasphemy. 4 stars. I was tempted to give this book the full 5 stars as it is an interesting book, reads as a narrative and there is an impressive level of research. However most of the letters printed in the book were of a similar nature and redundant. Virginia professes her love for Galileo and then spells out the more the mundane accounting details of day to day life. She is not central to the story beyond this context. I would have liked to see more science coverage in the book as Galileo was every bit as interesting and important to science as anyone in history including Newton or Einstein. "

This is definitely a biography of Galileo and not his daughter, although she is mentioned a bit (as ANY decent biographer would do when writing about a brilliant scientist who also had a genius child). So, because of the misleading title I was mostly disappointed, despite Galileo's contributions in physics and science. "
27,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738470-emilia,5,"Great book, fascinating, well written and well read. ( I did the audio book) I thuroughly enjoyed this one."
28,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,4,"Most people vaguely know of Galileo, the 16th century Italian astronomer who overturned the centuries-old Ptolemaic belief that the sun revolves around earth and subsequently found himself in trouble with the Catholic Church. What Sobel does in this book is to put a specific human face on the man, to show how, despite his brilliance, he was a man of his time, a devout Catholic, and a man like most of us who had worries about money, the welfare of his children, his health. Galileo’s daughter, a cloistered Poor Clare nun, is a part of this picture as her letters to her father have survived and are quoted from generously to demonstrate the loving nature of her father. Why was the church so opposed to Galileo’s scientific discoveries, ones he made with the use of better telescopes which he helped design, as well as his mathematical calculations? I think it was a matter of two factors. First, church theologians thought that a system that had the earth revolving around the sun contradicted Biblical passsages such as those from Ecclesiastes which has the sun rising and setting or the passage showing the sun stopping for Joshua. For Galileo this was never a problem as he thought, along with Augustine, that the interpretation of the Bible should never be restricted to a literal one. Rather, many of its passages were to be seen as using literary and symbolic devices, designed to foster people’s devotion,. A worthy aim, and that was all. Secondly, the Catholic Church, then as today, did not like to admit error. It valued consistency, and in Galileo’s case, there were condemnations of Copernicus who a half century earlier had refuted, on observable and mathematical grounds, the notion of a earth-centered solar system. So, to admit Galileo’s observations as true would be to reverse the opposition to Copernicus. Interestingly, no one really disputed either man on experimental data – it was a question of rejecting them because they opposed ideas of Aristotle who was highly revered. This distinction is at the heart of the opposition to Galileo – he didn’t match up with the vested interests in Aristotelian theories. Galileo was widely respected, though, and in l616 he got the green light from Cardinal Bellarmine to go ahead with his research, but he could promote his ideas as only “theory” not fact or truth. Just one “theory” among others. His way of following this prescription was to write a dialogue between three “seekers of truth”, one a pompous Aristotelian philosopher, one who was Galileo’s alter ego, and the third an intelligent impartial observer. They discuss over a period of four days Galileo’s sun-centered conclusions, and of course the reader ends up siding with Galileo as he has the better arguments. There, the matter stood until 15 years later, the case was reopened. There was now a new pope, Urban VIII, who was under political pressure from the 30 Years War to be firm in guarding the Catholic faith, from any more deviations from the “truth”. Cardinal Bellarmine, dead, was no longer around to stand up for Galileo, and he faced a very conservative panel of Inquisition cardinals who felt his dialogue was just a sneaky way of promoting a heretical position. Galileo’s ideas were condemned as false and opposed to doctrinal truth. and his writings on the subject were to be confiscated and destroyed. He was given a relatively lenient punishment, provided he recanted and admitted his position was false one..Galileo had no argument with the Church overall, just on this particular point. He signed documents admitting his “error” and was punished with a form of house arrest. He continued his research, although he was not allowed to publish anything. Should Galileo have acted differently? He was by now an old man, in poor health, and what was the point of subjecting himself to suffering and torture? His findings were already known, abroad in Protestant countries, if not in Italy. And he was supporting family members who would have been destitute without him. Given these considerations, his actions are understandable. The book fills in his life, then. The daughter’s letters, loving, but often seeking financial support for her convent, are interesting, but not really essential to the book. The author’s conclusion which comes down squarely on Galileo’s contribution to SCIENCE, not FAITH or LOVE, is that his importance lies in his emphasis on the practical and experimental value of science. Today, I think there is a parallel to be drawn between Galileo and the controversy over global warming. Vested interests, then as now, are opposed to changes that would mean a reversal of the accepted ways of thinking and doing things. And then, as now, there is a distrust of experimental and mathematical procedures that don’t line up with “common sense.” But that's a theory in itself, to be tested, just like any other. "
29,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171826-tyler-jones,0,"The letters Galileo's daughter wrote to him are like little snapshots into the life of early 17th century Italy, and also give us rare look at the person behind the legend as seen through the eyes of his adoring eldest daughter. Yes the pace is a bit slow, but it allows the reader to be slowly drawn in, to feel invested in the lives of these smart, good people. Most enjoyable."
30,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
31,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
32,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
33,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"
34,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537884-sean,3,"Galileo's Daughter tells the story of Galileo Galilei and his relationship with his oldest daughter, who entered a convent at the age of thirteen. Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic. The book he wrote that got him into trouble (after being approved by the local clergy editors) was on the list of banned books for nearly 200 years. "

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
44,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
45,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
46,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
47,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
48,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
49,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
50,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
51,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
52,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"

58,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
59,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
60,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
61,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
62,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
63,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"

Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period.

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
74,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
75,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
76,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
77,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
78,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
79,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
80,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
81,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
82,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"

88,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
89,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
90,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
91,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
92,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
93,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly.

Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic. The book he wrote that got him into trouble (after being approved by the local clergy editors) was on the list of banned books for nearly 200 years. "

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
104,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
105,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
106,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
107,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
108,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
109,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
110,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
111,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
112,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent.

I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible.

118,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
119,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
120,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
121,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
122,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
123,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"
124,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537884-sean,3,"Galileo's Daughter tells the story of Galileo Galilei and his relationship with his oldest daughter, who entered a convent at the age of thirteen. Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic.

133,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,3,"3.5 starsLikely you're already pretty familiar with the name Galileo Galilei, but if not, here's a rundown for you. Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
134,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
135,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
136,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
137,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
138,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
139,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
140,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
141,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
142,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"

148,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
149,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
150,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
151,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
152,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
153,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"
154,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537884-sean,3,"Galileo's Daughter tells the story of Galileo Galilei and his relationship with his oldest daughter, who entered a convent at the age of thirteen. Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period.

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
164,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
165,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
166,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
167,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
168,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
169,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
170,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
171,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
172,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"

178,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
179,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
180,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
181,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
182,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
183,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly.

Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic. The book he wrote that got him into trouble (after being approved by the local clergy editors) was on the list of banned books for nearly 200 years. "

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
194,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
195,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
196,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
197,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
198,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
199,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
200,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
201,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
202,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent.

208,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
209,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
210,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
211,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
212,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
213,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"

Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period.

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
224,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
225,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
226,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
227,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
228,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
229,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
230,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
231,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
232,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"

238,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
239,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
240,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
241,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
242,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
243,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"

Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic.

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
254,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
255,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
256,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
257,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
258,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
259,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "
260,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24063036-roo,4,"This book has given me such an appreciation for Galileo's genius and contributions to our modern world. Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
261,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
262,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "

268,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
269,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
270,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801480-jennifer,4,"This is a fascinating look into the family and friends around this historic man. It was quite dense in parts. Seems well-sourced and full of the context around these incredible scientific discoveries that were punished by the Church. I actually started this 10-15 years ago. So now it's finished. The narrative does not flow all of the time if you are thinking of Erik Larson, for example."
271,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My primary interest when I picked up this book was Galileo. Namely, I expected to get from his daughter's letters a more in-depth insight into Galileo's scientific endeavours. Instead, the focus of the letters is on the father - daughter relationship and the life in the convict of San Mateo, where Galileo put his two out-of-wedlock daughters while they were children. Though the letters do not shed any light on Galileo as a philosopher and a scientist, they are interesting to a certain degree because they bring into question the treatment of women in the society of the day, showing Galileo as a flesh-and-blood human being (who wasn't always likeable or unmistakeable, as I've just learned). They also show Suor Maria Celeste (born Victora Galilei) as a remarkably devoted and supportive daughter. My only quibble with this book is that I didn't get an impression it succeded in its attemt to raise the daughter above being of marginal significance in Galileo's life.I listened to the audio version of the book narrated by George Guidall, whose performance added authenticity to the archaic and flowery style not only of Suor Maria Celeste's letters but also of the book in general.Parts I and II, which focus on Galileo's attempts to finish and publish his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican, were a bit too slow for my liking and much less interesting than Parts III –VI, the emphasis of which is on the conflict between Church and Galileo. My attention was captured with a very good depiction of the atmosphere of the era and, above all, with the overview of how Galileo tried to reconcile his scientific mind with his faith, or rather, with his faithfulness to Catholic Church on the grounds that the Bible spoke to a more important purpose (view spoiler)[(as he had once heard the late Vatican librarian Cesare Cardinal Baronio remark, the Bible was a book about how one goes to Heaven – not how Heaven goes) (hide spoiler)] and chided the followers of Aristotle for being too timid to stray from their master's texts (view spoiler)[„They wish never to raise their eyes from those pages – as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristitle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.“ (hide spoiler)] I particularly liked excerpts from Galileo's his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican and his private correspondence with his contemporaries. What a pity Galileo's letters to his daughter got lost! I would have liked Galileo's Two New Sciences and his work on the laws of motion which Galileo would later judge ""superior to everything else of mine hitherto published"" were given a little better coverage instead of being interrupted by some repetitive mundane details."
272,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19004147-cheryl,4,"A fascinating and compelling read that manages to humanize one of the giants of the ages, Galileo Galilei. I learned so much from this book, so many things that I didn't know had once been believed to be true, and I have finally been able to reconcile my knowledge of history with the actuality of events. It is only from reading the dates at the bottom of S. Maria Celeste's letters to her father again and again that I finally realized that Galileo's trial for heresy took place some 13 years after the Puritans landex at Plymouth Rock. Somehow it always seemed a more distant event than that. I also didn't realize that Sir Isaac Newton did not come on the scene until after Galileo's death, such that the principles of the law of gravity were unknown to Galileo. That explains why he felt that the motion of the tides was evidence of the earth's rotation. Still, many of Galileo's studies encompassed in his final book (written after the trial) deal with physics and the laws of motion and truly reflect the birth of experimental science.so often Galileo is reduced in popular conception to the principle of heliocentrism, which minimizes his accomplishments as well as those of Copernicus, whose theories Galileo was merely defending.I also learned why so many religious scholars were against the more logical and reasonable heliocentric view, which did not require stars and planets to jump around the sky like sugar-crazed toddlers. They felt that to confine God's processes and designs to logic, that would limit the power and majesty of an Omnipotent God.Finally, I learned that it was not the Roman Catholic Church which condemned Galileo for his scientific views. It was the Officd of the Holy Inquisition (which is a separate entity from the Church in much the same way that the Post Office is separate from the U.S. Government) that condemned him for failure to obey a specific command given to him as strictly as they wanted.A great read; would gladly recommend it to others."
273,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"If you want to read a biography of Galileo Galilei, there are many to choose from. And make no mistake, this is primarily a biography of the father, not the daughter. But the inclusion of numerous letters from eldest daughter, with whom he kept up a decades-long correspondence, brings a more personal and intimate dimension to the biography. It's unfortunate that the correspondence is all one-way, in the form of Maria Celeste's letters to Galileo, some of which were preserved. While he wrote just as many letters to her, they are thought to have been destroyed by the convent during the period in which possessing any of his writings could get a person in serious trouble with the church.Three things struck me about this book:Rage on behalf of Galileo's daughters. Galileo had three illegitimate children, and the two daughters, being unmarriageable, were carted off to a convent at the ages of 13 and 10, there to live cloistered lives of constant material privation, discomfort, inadequate food and sleep, and endless hard work. Meanwhile, the youngest child, who happened to be born with a Y chromosome, was the beneficiary of a church decree legitimizing him and was sent off to university, where he was an indifferent student, spent his father's money like water, and ran up gambling debts. I don't know whether I'm more angry at the patriarchy generally for deciding this type of disparity was okay, or at Galileo personally for being the direct architect of it for his own children. The absolute best anyone can say for him is that he was a product of his time and he just did what was expected. Which is a pretty weak defense.My rage reached its greatest crescendo when non-cloistered men, who had the freedom to go on hunting parties, travel Italy, enjoy fine dinners, and the like, had the nerve to heap praise on Maria Celeste's goodness, holiness, humility, and industry... and then merrily go on with their comfortable non-cloistered lives, while doing basically nothing to improve her life. I was intensely reminded of St. Augustine's famous plea, “Lord, make me pure – but not yet!” These assholes are singing a slight variant: “Lord make me pure – but not as pure as her!” This is the same rage I feel at the fucking hypocrisy of a patriarchy that lionizes mothers and motherhood in general, while simultaneously making sure the lives of actual mothers are as sucky and difficult as possible. “We think you're terrific... we just can't be bothered to do anything to actually support you. Carry on by yourselves, you're doing a great job, girls!”Neither of those girls chose that life, and the younger sister, who never wrote letters, spent a great deal of time in the convent's infirmary, and may have been a chronic malingerer, probably had the more reasonable reaction to it. Maria Celeste is more like a whipped dog who nevertheless crawls back to an abusive master. Her fawning letters to the man who put her in there, which are filled with constant self-deprecation despite her obvious talents and intelligence, nearly made me ill. What could she have accomplished if 
she
 had been allowed to study at university, and not her feckless, average-at-best baby brother?The cloistered/quarantined life. It was interesting to me to vread this in spring 2020, while much of the world is forcibly cloistered due to COVID-19, and see the parallels. You know how insane nearly everyone is to get out of their homes and do things right now? Now imagine never leaving the convent grounds your whole life. That's Maria Celeste's life, from age 13 until the day she died. She sees the world through a grate in the convent refectory that allows her to look out at visiting guests, and through her letters and the gifts that those outside the convent send her. Her only outlet, aside from her daily religious devotions and the ordinary work of the convent, was the the exchange of letters and gifts with the outside world. Her father would send raw materials, and she would return lovingly made handicrafts.In 17th-century Italy, pervasive censorship is totally normal. This was hard for me to even grasp, as someone who's spent my whole life taking concepts like freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and church/state separation for granted. What blew me away the most wasn't just that Galileo's work was ruled heretical, but that it was condemned after he went through an entire laborious process of getting it vetted, edited, and approved by church censors. Anyone who wanted to publish anything had to get it past the religious censors first, and a significant part of Galileo's defense at his trial was, “But I went through all the normal channels, made all the changes the censors required, and got approval to publish it.” Then I continued to be shocked at the power the church had to reach deep into his daily life and order him imprisoned, order him to say certain prayers of penitence at certain times (I don't know how they enforced that), who he could see, what they could discuss during private visits, and even ostensibly what he could think. All I can say is thank goodness for Enlightenment thinkers who ultimately brought us separation of church and state.But as I read, I found myself thinking, “From their own point of view, they were quite right to try to suppress it. It was a threat to the church, and they knew it at some level even if they didn't consciously know it.” When science starts to demonstrate that your central holy book is just flat-out wrong in its description of the world, your religion is at a turning point. You're at a point where you have to admit something damaging about that text. Its imperfections demonstrate one of two things: either it's not really the word of God, or God is not really perfect. Those are the only two real possibilities - every other argument you can make about metaphors, etc. is just admitting God's a poor communicator, which is just another way of saying God is imperfect. A deity who can't or won't provide its followers with a sacred text that is crystal clear, cannot be misunderstood, and is flawlessly accurate in its every description of the physical world, is not a perfect deity. And if the Catholic church of 17th-century Rome had known where the institution would stand and what the state of the world would be 300 years later, they doubtlessly would have persecuted Galileo and suppressed his work far more ruthlessly. Recommended reading: The Hydrogen Sonata (for reasons I can't explain without spoilers but has to do with inerrant religious texts)"
274,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537884-sean,3,"Galileo's Daughter tells the story of Galileo Galilei and his relationship with his oldest daughter, who entered a convent at the age of thirteen. Though the story is predominantly about Galileo and his life and struggles, it is told in part from the perspective of Suor Maria Celeste in the letters that she writes regularly to her father.Galileo, born in 1564 in Italy, went on to become the foremost scientist of his day, inventing the first telescope and arguing for the Copernican physical view of the world that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, rather than the Earth. Though a devout Christian, Galileo was ultimately placed on trial for his views, found guilty of heresy, and forced to spend his remaining years under house arrest.Sobel's novel is unique in the way that it structures the story of Galileo around the letters that his daughter wrote to him and their love and loyalty towards each other. Her regular letters to Galileo provide a very human view of a man that Einstein later called ""the father of modern physics""."

Galileo and his daughter were very close and her letters to him had been saved and make up part of this book. They remained loyal to each other through his trials with the church. The book did discuss his work and the problems that caused with the church. The only problem I had with the book was that at times it did not flow well and reading about his work took a lot of concentration but I did enjoy his daughter's letters. His letters to her were never found or had been destroyed. It is a fascinating look back at that time period and Suor Maria Celeste shed a light on what it was like living in a convent in that time period. Had she been born in modern ages, I could see her working with her father in his area since she comes across as very intuitive and smart."

The title implies that the book is about her, but really, it's about him.It was fascinating to read about Galileo's trial for heresy and how he tried to balance his Catholic faith (which meant abiding by the Pope's edicts) and the conflicting scientific observations he made about the sun being the center of the solar system. When science and religion collided, he chose religion, and was still labeled a heretic. The book he wrote that got him into trouble (after being approved by the local clergy editors) was on the list of banned books for nearly 200 years. "

Galileo is now known as being one of the most famous (possibly THE most famous?) astronomers and mathematicians of the 17th century. His work and studies also earned him the titles of physicist, inventor, and professor (teaching courses in mathematics and military architecture at various Italian universities, even teaching some of the Medici children for a time).What Galileo might be more well known for now is him being placed under indefinite house arrest after being so bold as to come out and proclaim that the universe might, in fact, NOT revolve around Earth. He goes on to say that not only Earth but all the other planets rotate around the sun! GASP! We can laugh now, having centuries to benefit from being privy to astounding advancements in the field of astronomy, but back in Galileo's day, his statement was considered full on heresy. Funny thing though, he wasn't even the first guy to put forth the idea! In the year 1600, just a year before Galileo's first daughter, Virginia (the daughter referenced in Sobel's title), was born, Friar Giordano Bruno posed the same idea. Know what happened to him? BURNED AT THE STAKE. Church was not having your new fangled scientific theories back then.In Galileo's case, he was a deeply devout Catholic, but he was also a firm supporter of the ideas of Copernicus, one example being when Galileo took on Monsignor Francesco Ignoli, Secretary of the Congregation of Propogation Of The Faith (imagine trying to order letterhead for that office!). In a letter addressed to Galileo, Ignoli relentlessly bashed all of Copernicus' major points. At first Galileo chose to not respond. Not wanting to ""feed the trolls"" as us in the online crowd commonly like to call it, he initially didn't see much point in offering a comeback. But when he started to notice that his silence was being interpreted as acceptance of Ignoli's views, THEN Galileo felt compelled to set the record straight. This response letter being pages and pages long, Galileo was inspired to take portions of it and expand ideas he put forth to Ignoli into a book entitled Dialogue on the Tides. By June 1630, Dialogue on the Tides was approved for publication, but with stipulations. Galileo was informed that the pope disliked the working title, and the preface and ending must be altered to reflect the pope's philosophy on science which meant that Galileo's text needed to have a more obvious lean toward ""the mysterious omnipotence of God"", as Sobel phrases it. Didn't matter what Galileo was proving or disproving with scientific fact. The back and forth on the stipulations caused the actual publication of Galileo's book to be delayed until February 1632. Nearly 2 years of haggling! Even with negotiations, being approved for publication, all of that... the Vatican was not pleased with the final product. In fact, they were so upset, by September of 1632 an order was sent out for the book to cease being sold and Galileo got summons from his local Inquisition panel. Galileo's health was extremely frail during this time, his doctors even advising that he not be moved from his home, but the Vatican's response to the news was that either Galileo show his face willingly or prepare to come in in shackles. Seeing no other choice but to submit, Galileo made his travel arrangements but not without first making sure his will was up to date! During his Inquisition interviews, Galileo admitted that he went back and read over the text after publication and found holes in some of his reasonings, areas that lacked sufficient scientific proof. (BTW, Sobel's book here includes a transcript of Galileo's actual testimony during those interviews). Even so, the then 70 year old and sickly Galileo was still charged with heresy and given indefinite house arrest. Interestingly though, even with this verdict, there were three men on the deciding panel who REFUSED to sign their names to the written verdict! It is rumored that Galileo muttered ""but it still moves"" under his breath after signing his own name to the affidavit, but Sobel argues that Galileo wouldn't have been so stupid as to say such a thing in front of a group of men who held such power over his life at that moment (though I have to admit, if it DID happen, that would've been pretty badass of the guy!). As for the book itself, Dialogue of the Tides (the ""working"" title stayed put through all this) was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books in 1664 and remained there for nearly 200 years. Still, copies of the work traveled through various black markets across Europe (an English translation was even printed up in 1661). Though under house arrest, Galileo continued to offer tutoring / mentorship services within his home and went on to write more books on theories of motion and mechanics. The Two New Sciences was published in 1638. It was weeks before he was sent his own copy but by then his struggles with cataracts & glaucoma had become too much of a problem for him to be able to read much of anything. It's been speculated by some historians (going by the scientist's surviving correspondence where he describes struggles with constant pain) that in his later years he may also struggled with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney stones, hernia issues, chronic eye infections and insomnia (probably as a result from all the physical pain!) before finally succumbing to death in January 1642. All this on Galileo, why haven't I mentioned the daughter yet? Well, truthfully I have a bit of an issue with this book having the title Galileo's Daughter because in actuality much of what I read was just about the man himself; scenes of the daughter being interjected here and there but not as strongly as one might presume judging from this title. In fact, Sobel barely references the daughter in this title -- except to mention her birth and taking her convent vows -- until about 100 pages in. We get to know her a bit and then she frequently pops back out of the spotlight except through excerpts of her letters to her father from time to time. But here is what I gathered about this woman largely lost to history (but less so than her siblings!): Galileo's eldest daughter, born Virginia, was the eldest of three illegitimate children Galileo fathered. Because Galileo never married Virginia's mother, Virginia herself was deemed ""unmarriageable"", so it was decided she would join convent life. Thanks dad!It's all good though. Virginia actually took quite well to the nunnery, being placed with the Florentine order of the Poor Clares at the age of 13; the Poor Clares being a sisterhood of voluntary extreme poverty. Extreme even by ""took an oath of poverty"" standards. Not only were their habits made of the roughest material, but their meager pantries were kept to only what was absolutely necessary for survival. It was not uncommon for sisters to be bordering on starvation in order to feel closer to God. In the days of Sister Clare herself, the Vatican actually feared the woman WOULD starve herself to death! Virginia took the name Sister Celeste as a nod to her father's work and general love of stars, which she greatly admired. The strong bond between Galileo and his eldest was largely due to Celeste being the most curious and intelligent (in his opinion) of his children. Another of Galileo's daughters, Livia, also joined the same convent shortly after her sister, taking the wickedly cool name Sister Arcangela, but had much more of a struggle acclimating to the environment. Many of Celeste's letters in this book make brief mention of Livia's somewhat morose attitude most days, one letter plainly stating ""Livia is already displaying a morbid tendency to melancholy and withdrawal that would shade her adult personality."" Livia's struggles made me feel for her and also made me more curious about her in general but sadly Sobel doesn't go into much detail about this daughter, perhaps just because there's even less about her than Celeste. While I found Celeste's letters interesting, I was surprised at how few were actually included in this book, seeing as how the synopsis references how Sobel ""crafts a narrative from 124 surviving letters between father and daughter."" Sister Celeste seemed like a woman with a good bit of depth too her but I also felt like she was sometimes WAY too hard on herself, in some letters referring to herself as someone of ""meager intelligence"" or writing to her father to profusely apologize for things that struck me as insubstantial errors or wrongdoings. Humility is admirable, but not when it starts to border on self abuse.  Overall, for the amount of information Sobel covers in this dual biography of sorts, while I didn't find the writing style itself consistently, 100% engaging, the approach I would say is definitely accessible to the average reader. It's a solidly entertaining and educational read for those interested in Galileo or the time in which he lived. There is also an element to Galileo's life story that can inspire thinkers and dreamers of today's world. Think about it -- the guy was willing to challenge not only his own religious upbringing and beliefs that went against his research, but also fellow scientists who were comfortably stuck in their ways, in order to unlock the mysteries of the natural world. His life's work is proof that the naysaying of ""haters"" as we label them today is based in fear and discomfort with the unknown. Was he always in the right? No, not always, but at least he was brave enough to branch out and challenge himself and others! "
284,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb,3,"The title of this book should not include the word ""daughter."" It misled me to thinking the book would focus on Galileo's daughter. Yes, she is certainly mentioned, the book contains letters written by her to him, and it shows their strong love for one another throughout their lives, but the book isn't about her. It's about Galileo and his life's work. The rest of the title is perfectly descriptive. It's definitely historical, scientific, reflects faith, and shows Galileo's loves. The book itself is fine. It's probably even very well done. It was also exhausting for me to read. I needed something light and easy. This is neither. I wanted to read a lovely tale of Galileo's daughter's life in the monastery with maybe a small side of history and science. I got the opposite and none of it was particularly lovely. I was also very curious, and became even more so as the book went on, about Virginia/Maria Celeste's younger sister Livia/Arcangela and her difficult personality and possible mental health issues. Instead it felt like I was reading a book for a scientific history class-- still intriguing and educational, but not what I thought I signed up for. At the same time, I'm glad I read it. I learned things about astronomy, physics, and the scientific process. I became aware of the dramatic effects of health problems on people from that age because of the lack of medical care and knowledge. I was previously ignorant and therefore surprised and disappointed by the blind ignorance of the powerful, governing, and controlling Catholic church. It was hard to read of the injustices done to Galileo and to understand the infuriating way they denied clear evidence that the earth is not the stationary center of the universe. Galileo was a very faith-filled and religious person. He tolerated and endured a ridiculous amount of torment. Despite how he was treated, he knew that science and religion don't have to be mutually exclusive. Reading this book helped me see that because of our limited understanding and narrow interpretations, we can be blinded to reality. I'm resolved to be more open minded."
285,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"This is the fourth book by Dava Sobel I’ve read (The Glass Universe, Longitude, and The Planets being the earlier ones). She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific.As is my style, let me get my few “negatives” out of the way at the beginning. While this book focuses a lot of attention on Galileo’s daughter, Suor Maria Celeste, her letters, and their relationship, it is only one of the topics focused upon in this book. Additionally, Galileo’s letters written back to his daughter have been lost or destroyed so this is a one sided correspondence. As in her other books, Dava Sobel does not present her material sequentially. She jumps back and forth outlining Galileo’s and Celeste’s lives in order to give you a deeper sense of who they were to and show how earlier events lead into later ones but it can make your reading a little confusing.That said, Sobel tells you right in the title that this book focuses on faith and love in addition to science. The personal and personalities are as important in her books as the history and science. In the case of Galileo this information gives you a far greater understanding of his life and his life’s work.While Galieo ended up being tried as a heritic, he and his family were extremely religious. Galileo took his catholic religion seriously and supported both his daughters and the convent they lived in through his life. I think it is safe to say that Galileo felt his scientific discoveries were more a tribute to god’s creation than a sacrilege.Sobel has, once again, written a scientific book that should appeal to a very wide audience. There is enough in this book about what Galileo discovered and how he came to his hypotheses and conclusions to satisfy the casual scientist. There is also enough about his relationships with his children and their mother to satisfy those interested in biographies. And there is enough about the church and the times to give those interested in history insight into the time.An interesting side note: this book has quite a bit about how the Black Plague spread death throughout Italy in both the 1300s and 1600s. Reading it while I am quarantined during the Covid 19 outbreak and after the devastation it brought to Italy puts an interesting historical perspective on today’s events. In fact, the word quarantine comes from quadrant giorni - a forty day isolation Venetian rulers subjected travelers to in 1348 that was based on the time Christ sequestered himself in the wilderness."
286,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51573916-dawn,5,"An absorbing account of Galileo's life, covering his scientific discoveries and (of course) his heresy conviction. I was vaguely aware that he had to spend the last years of his life under house arrest because he had temerity to suggest that the earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round (well, write a book that suggested Copernicus, who first came up that view, may have had a point), but I never realised quite how harshly he was punished. He wasn't allowed to publish books or even teach after his heresy conviction (though he didn't exactly obey the spirit of this law - such an approach had got him into trouble in the first place). The worse thing he was, according to Sobel, basically persecuted because the the Pope at the time needed to prove a point rather than actually believing Galileo went against scripture. However, this book is also about his daughter Virginia (or Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun). Galileo packed both of his daughters off to a nunnery when they were young teenagers, which seems an awful thing to do by today's standards. But, actually, it was their best option - as they were illegitimate, they had flip all chance of marrying well. Virginia probably had opportunities she never would have done otherwise - she was essentially the convent's doctor (technically, apothecary). Judging by the letters she sent to her father, she was a bright and capable woman. One can only imagine what she could have achieved had lived in enlightened enough times to allow it. "
287,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I first heard about this book from my father who read it when it first came out (read it on his Palm Pilot, so yeah it's been a while). Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it.First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth.(view spoiler)[ And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" (hide spoiler)]So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book. For me it wasn't the best book I'd read and it was difficult for me to finish."
288,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,4,"Intensely fascinating, this book takes a non-scientific reader through the story of Galileo and his discoveries, including through his close relationship with his daughter via preserved letters that she wrote to him. Given the traditional portrayal of Galileo’s work as a war between science and the church, it was illuminating to discover not just how his scientific discoveries were taken (both positively and negatively, including some within the scientific literate Catholic church hierarchy) but in how deeply personal and even political the disagreements (and thus the outcomes) were amongst a select group and how much personal faith Galileo had. Quite apart from a monolithic entity, there are numerous personalities which had a significant (positive and negative) influence on Galileo’s scientific life and the events that transpired.As my friend David accurately put it, ‘[t]here are broader messages to be taken and considered about science, faith, and the interplay between them’. This is a book that I may not have instinctively picked up on my own, but am very grateful to have been recommended it. "
289,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834133-tammy-king-carlton,4,"I had assumed this was a memoir about Maria Celeste, Galileo’s older daughter—- but it is actually a memoir of Galileo, which includes a lot of information about his life because he kept dozens and dozens of letters she had written to him, commenting and responding to his own letters to her, which were not preserved. They were clearly very close. Very interesting passages about the division between science and religion, particularly leading up to his trial and specifically the hypothesis that the earth orbits a stationary sun rather than the other way around, and how much this alarmed the Catholic Church. Also, particularly interesting commentary regarding the arrival of the plague to Italy, and so much of the same precautions and mandates from their public health leaders and the conflict it caused among citizens who felt their freedoms infringed upon verses the danger of how quickly the plague spread and the subsequent entire quarantining of cities and towns—- it feels very relatable in our current COVID-19 climate. Eerily similar. "

Sobel clears up some myths about Galileo all the while paying homage to his memory. Dava Sobel added ""love"" in her title, because much of what we know of the man is through the letters that have survived from his daughter Suor Maria Celeste. She wrote to him of the mundane and also of the existential, both in his life and her own. But Sobel doesn't rely strictly on these accounts, but rather weaves in the contextual world of Galileo's time. The need to tow the line with the papacy, and the cycles of the plague. I was utterly charmed by the book: Galileo's supreme confidence in his observations, and by a daughter's love and affection for her father. "
291,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386809-christie,3,"So the first thing you need to know is that this book, despite the title, is not about Galileo's Daughter. In fact, she only features in a little over half the book. A better title would have been ""GALILEO...and his daughter."" Now don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about Galileo than I did before, and learning about his family added another dimension to the story. Suora Maria Celeste's story was also interesting and gave a look at how women during that time were able to carve out a life for themselves with the scraps that society gave them. I loved her letters which were so relatable even after almost 400 years. So the book is good if you want to learn more about Galileo and a little bit about his daughter, but you may be disappointed if you expected his daughter to be the focus of the story. "
292,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294174-natasha,4,"This is a fantastic book that presents the life of Galileo through thorough research and particularly letters from his daughter who lived in a convent. I found the politics of church and science fascinating. I found myself admiring Galileo not only for his amazing intelligence but also his goodness, kindness, humor, honesty and determination. I really appreciate Galileo’s critique of how we should read the Bible. Galileo’s daughter, who is buried with him, “even now, no inscription on Galileo’s much-visited tomb in Santa Croce announces the presence of Suor Maria Celeste. But still she is there.” "
293,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219612-karla,1,"I could not get through this book. I attempted to read it in Kindle and only made it to about 20%. I feel like I could have shortened the read and gleaned just as much information from Wikipedia. This wasn't about Galileo's daughter at all, it mentioned her sure, but it's about Galileo, which is fine but it read like a text book and I've been there done that. I have limited time to read so I'm going to skip to a book that actually holds my interest and doesn't put me to sleep. 😪"
294,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6687668-harriett-milnes,4,"This curious book provided a visit to the 17th century whenever I opened it. Ms. Sobel provides a month by month history of Galileo's life, punctuated with his daughter's letters. (His answers have not been found.) She has been a nun living in a convent, providing apothecary care to the other nuns. You are given a close up view of Galileo's life and travails as well as the church politics of the time. Slow going, with no highpoints to speak of, but a curiously moving portrait."

Maybe the last 1/3 talks about his daughter, but the first 2/3 did not, and this book should have been titled: Galileo: a very dry biography. Just go read Wikipedia."
296,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49642658-jameyanne-fuller,4,"The title was a bit misleading, because this was more about Galileo than his daughter, but it was still fascinating."
297,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65334322-j-jones,5,"Fantastic historical account of Galileo and his daughter's correspondences. I know the man much better now, and the events. "
298,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,5,"To find yourself a little in love with the mind of a seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher can come as a surprise to the average reader such as myself. How one man can contribute quite so much to our understanding of the world and beyond is awe-inspiring as is making the experience of reading about him so enjoyable.Dava Sobel does an excellent job of helping us to see Galileo the person, partly through the obvious high esteem he was held in by so many from Popes to servants, partly in the care and concern he showed for these same friends and family but, primarily in his relationship with his eldest daughter Suor Maria Celeste. My first reaction on finding that Galileo wouldn’t marry the mother of his three children and shut up both the girls in a nunnery from the ages of twelve and thirteen to their death was, “What a git!” But I had to gently push my twentieth century perspective out of the way and understand that this was perfectly normal at the time, and that if the alternative was arranged marriage to some unknown quantity, perhaps a nunnery was not such an unappealing prospect.Through her letters we see that for Maria Celeste, there was no hate for her Father for that decision. Her letters are consistently caring, empathetic and self-less, although she is not afraid to ask for many favors from her Father for the nunnery and its individual members. It’s difficult to read about how hard their lives were despite their vows of poverty, yet it seems Galileo answered every request and only wanted his daughters to be comfortable and happy.We only get to hear one side of the correspondence between the two as Galileo’s letters to his daughter were lost and I mourn this fact along with Dava Sobel for the even greater insight we would have had into their relationship. Having said that, Galileo was a prolific correspondent and so we do at least have surviving letters he wrote to others yet the nature of their bond, which Sobel so effortlessly surmises, can still only really be guessed at by his actions and those of others. I loved the very telling story about the final resting place of Galileo and his tomb but will leave that to the reader to find out for themselves.Galileo was a true Renaissance man, a mathematician and philosopher as well as a poet and playwright, writing plays for the nuns to perform at the same time he was revolutionizing the knowledge of physics. He was also, however, a highly religious man and the conflict between this inquiring brain that looked into the stars and the interpretations of scripture by others -not scripture itself for he saw no conflict between this and science - caused him endless pain. What was fascinating was that so many other religious men admired and respected his findings and it was really only his numerous enemies that made these so controversial. Looking back it is difficult to understand the power that the Papacy, in particular, had to restrict knowledge that now for us seems undeniable, but it took almost two hundred years for Galileo’s ‘Dialogue’ to be removed from the Index of Prohibited Books. Suor Maria Celeste always believed in her Father and his work without question. Their relationship thrived on the fact that she could converse about and understand the work her Father did and one can only imagine what she herself could have contributed to his work if free to live like a man. This is a fascinating account of the life of a scientific pioneer made more real and empathetic by the relationships he had with many, but in particular his much loved older daughter. "
299,0140280553,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Galileo has been the popular focus of the origin of church-science antipathy, and to the extent that he catalysts the modern scientific method this is perhaps justified, but there is so much more to the story. In this book, a more sympathetic view of the church's response to Galileo's promotion of a heliocentric universe is presented. Amidst the reformation turmoil taking place in Europe, the acceptance of a new teaching was a difficult case for a politically constricted pope to approve, and indeed like many 'big science' decisions, political leaders have more than 'the science' to decide on. It is easy to side with the 'winners' of historical conflicts with the omniscience of hindsight, so reading through some of the recorded transcripts Sobel includes helps ward against simplistic conclusions. A central figure in the story is Galileo's daughter, who is brought into the story through her correspondence with her father from the confines of her convent. Through her, the religious feeling of the day is displayed. There is a dignity and purity in her approach to her lot in life and to her fathers trials, despite the 'conflict of interest' she might be thought to have as a result of her place as a nun. Galileo's faith complex and unconventional as it is, also becomes apparent through their correspondence. Whilst hie engagement with the church officials is very much for show, his letters to his daughter also suggest that some core of sincerity underlay his flowery flattery. I think the book balances well the theological and scientific battle which continues to today. Of interest to me is the fact that the conflict was ultimately with bad theology and insitutionalised dogma, than with the bible itself. Protestants of the day seemed to be less worried by the new findings (I speculate) despite their more rigid reliance on scripture alone than the scroiture plus tradition approach of the catholic church. Not that Protestants are without fault in their engagement with sceince either, especially in the creationism department. However, Galileo did not have all the facts correctly worked out before using them as proof either, and a sceptic of any suit would not have been unjustified in their criticism. New findings in science take some time before being fully validated so both theologians and scientists should take more time to contemplate what truths if any require adjustment. More on that in a future review More Than a Theory: Revealing a Testable Model for Creation. I found this to be a very human perspective on the man known to many as a symbol, the devotion of his daughter adding a warm sentiment to the otherwise hard-edged words describing science, politics and conflict. Worthwhile reading."
