He would answer every question in language young and old could appreciate, complete with illustrations. Neil de Grasse Tyson is "" Merlin "" for the purpose of this book and answers questions people have written to Merlin. The address is included in the book if there is still something you want to ask. Why do stars twinkle, and planets don't? What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped rotating? If the sun disappeared, how much time would we have to worry about it? (500 seconds incase you were wondering) Merlin even addresses life on other planets. Every answer is intelligent and easy to understand. A light year is not a year with fewer calories, its a convenient yardstick for measuring cosmic distance. A humorous fast read by a scientist/astronomer who is entertaining in any form."
1,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/650095-christina,3,Random science stuff. Big ideas. Universe. Q&A. Huh? What? Run that by me again. Whoa. Okay. Wow.
2,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1681381-awallens,3,"This was a short simple and cute book about the planets stars sun moon galaxies and time. I found myself going, oh that's how that happens, or aaahhh! Several times while reading this, and going hmmm interesting I need to do more research on that. A fun and quick book in an easy to read question and answer format. Well done!"
3,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9449890-jherane-patmore,5,"Really fun and entertaining book. It's extremely light in writing, but heavy with facts. It's wonderful that anyone of any age/education level can read this without becoming bored. I'd recommend this book to any Space Enthusiast."
4,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6062425-joran-wauters,3,"Let me start off by saying that the question & answer format was really appealing to me. There is definitely need for that, not only in the field of astronomy. The questions are the type of questions you're ""forced"" to answer when you tell your friends 'that you know a thing or two about astronomy' late at night in a bar. As the introduction stated, the book isn't a primer or some sort of tutorial, so keep that in mind.The answers are really well written and, most importantly for this book, in very plain language (although I didn't care for the occasional attempts at poetry - sorry Neil). Another good thing is that you can open the book at any page without missing out on much. Finally, the book includes a glossary of selected terms, which was was really indispensable in my opinion. However, I can't give this book more than 3 stars for the following reasons:1)It's hard to find out who exactly the target group is. Although aimed at lay people, the level of difficulty isn't very well balanced. There are question & answers that a first grader would understand, while on the other hand I'm myself struggling to comprehend certain phrases. 2)The illustrations are childish and the narrator Merlin (who comes from the Andromeda Galaxy and knew all the great scientists ever lived in person) doesn't add anything to the book. The fact that he speaks in the third person makes it even more bizarre. Maybe it did work better in its original format (a question & answer column in Star Date, an astronomy magazine). 3)It's a tad outdated, the book came out in the year 1989. The most obvious example is the change in Pluto's planetary status."
5,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5656529-carolyn,3,This is an older book (Pluto was still a planet) but I found the information very enlightening. This book is a Q & A with Merlin (a fictional character) with questions that people have asked about the universe (true answers -at least at the time). I never realized how much I did not know about the universe - it made me wanting to learn more. Overall a 3.4 star book.
6,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87878907-sara-cintron,5,"This was the perfect book to read with my kids. It gave us the chance to discuss science, answer their questions in an entertaining way and not to mention the quality time... loved it!"
7,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31647526-jason-shorb,4,"If you have the slightest interest in the wonders of the universe but aren't interested in cracking open a dense textbook on the subject nor trying to interpret some of the more esoteric scientific terminology, then I'd highly recommend this book. This book is basically a Q&A format which makes it a great book for picking up and putting down without skipping a beat or enjoying as a casual read over breakfast to learn something new, and potentially put into perspective any challenges you may have for the day.This book has obviously been around for quite a while now so some of the references are somewhat dated, but when you are discussing time in relative terms of light years, than a few decades seems like just a fraction of a second that has passed. Overall, this was really my first exposure to NDT and can see why he has such a popular fan following."
8,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9453880-kim-roenfeldt,3,"This is an interesting book that tackles lots of questions dealing with the universe. It is a little dated, but I enjoyed it. My issue with the book is that, at times, it is assumed that you already understand certain aspects of astrophysics. There were sections dealing with quasars, pulsars, etc. and I've never studied astrophysics, so I don't really know what those are, and the book did not explain them. ""Merlin"" answered questions people had about them, but I would have enjoyed a quick paragraph explaining what they are to begin with, before diving into the specific question."
9,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11250074-trevor,5,"This book is written from the perspective of Merlin, some kind of all knowing person from the other side of the galaxy (something like that). He's not important.What is important is all of the crazy, amazing things you learn and think about over the course this reading(that is, if you can manage to put aside your ego long enough)."
10,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2198314-renato-quiroga,4,I learn a lot from this book. I was a curious little child and thanks to this book I start my interest in science (that remains to this day). A lot of questions by adults and childs about the space and beyond are answered by Merlin (a visitor from the stars). Highly reccomended to all ages readers!
11,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7297793-david,4,"Tyson is always fun to read, and he makes many difficult concepts easier to understand. There are a few times when he gets so carried away with his answer he doesn't really answer what was asked (but the questions are often irrelevant to what he is explaining, anyway).And a very quick read."
12,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7128569-amandee,2,"Ok, possibly I'm not the targeted audience -- but I found this book to be boring, dry, and bland. I love you Tyson, but definitely expected more. Hoping your other books will be more of what I needed."
13,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557983-lauren,4,"Very informative review of the stars, the sun, the galaxies, the universe, and all the matter in between."
14,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164576-robin-leblanc,5,This was AMAZING morning reading for me. A few quick facts to start the day worked wonders. Tyson is an amazing writer with a true passion for his work.
15,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16057949-mike,4,"good book overall - older and so therefore some of the entries are outdated, but NtG's writing is amazing :)"
16,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6008004-abner-huertas,5,I was looking for a book with the Q&A format until I found this one. I really enjoyed the way Neil answers each question with a little humour but conscience and direct.
17,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10644996-whitney,4,Would love to have tea with Merlin in a restaurant at the end of the galaxy!
18,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27264316-derek,4,Good to know that Tyson has been using the same jokes for 20 something years. Never change <3
19,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51272720-jason,4,"Cosmic queries in reading format. This is put simply, a fun read."
20,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46400906-rachel-wicker,5,This is a very easy read! A nice introduction to astrophysics.
21,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812952-evie,4,"I am now more cosmic'ly enlightened,After Merlin's answers I have read.They were concise and they were clever,And only slightly over my head."
22,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37678060-gary,4,"Well done overview of the basics, and one feels that none of them should be taken for granted. "
23,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4034405-deb,5,"A very fun way to learn. This is a great little book to capture one's interest in science, especially astronomy. It is erfect for all ages. "
24,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19894192-charlie,3,"Not my favorite Neil deGrasse Tyson book. Interesting, informative, a little snarky at times. An odd format. Glad he's matured a bit since then."
25,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"MERLIN’S TOUR OF THE UNIVERSE is a collection of questions asked by the general public and answered by Merlin, a visitor from the Andromeda galaxy who is as old as Earth and has observed the major scientific achievements of recorded Earth history.Merlin writes a question-and-answer column for Star Date, the astronomy magazine published for the lay reader by the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin.This book is not intended to be an astronomy tutorial. Its focus is guided entirely by questions asked by interested readers who have ranged from age four to age ninety.Dear Merlin,What would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped rotating?JONATHAN SWANNSAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIAAmong other things, we would all fall over and roll due east at about 800 miles per hour (the exact speed depends on your latitude on Earth). The Pacific Ocean would wash up onto North and South America and the Atlantic Ocean would wash up onto Europe and Africa. Many other unpleasant things would also happen.Once it all settled down, the Earth day would equal the Earth year and there would be no tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones, or typhoons.Dear Merlin,What would happen to me if I fell into a black hole?BENNY JACKSONTULSA, OKLAHOMAIn your feet-first diveTo this cosmic abyss,You will not surviveBecause you will not miss.The tidal forces of gravityWill create quite a calamityWhen you are stretched head-to-toe.Are you sure you want to go?Your body’s atoms—you will see them,Will enter one-by-one.The event horizon will eat ’em.You won’t be having fun."
26,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,3,"I picked this up because the theme of my library's summer reading challenge is space and I needed a book from the 520s. I am familiar with Neil deGrasse Tyson from his other work, so I picked up Merlin's Tour specifically because I expected it to be an entertaining - if a bit out of date, as it was originally published in '89 - read. True to form, it was. With wit and sometimes even poetry, the eponymous 'Merlin' clearly and concisely answers the questions posed to him, thus taking all readers on an exploratory and educational ride. "
27,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61665043-tony,4,"A series of bite-size questions and answers about our universe. The questions were sent in by readers and reasonably well answered by ""Merlin"". He does become smarmy from time to time, but I guess that what happens when you are immortal... Four of five on Goodreads."
28,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56658989-vykky,3,Very odd
29,0385488351,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102511222-aidan,5,This is a very good book from a very good author. It is also a cool way to share facts and answer peoples questions. I would recomened this book to anyone who is intrested in space.
