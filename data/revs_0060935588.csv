It would however certainly know the same mathematics that we do. And it would understand the phenomenon of the prime numbers and their significance as much as, perhaps more than, we do. Mathematics is the natural religion of the cosmos; and prime numbers are its central mystery.Prime numbers are those integers which can only be divided without remainder by themselves (or of course by 1). Put another way, as du Sautoy does, prime numbers are the atoms from which all other numbers are composed. 1, 2, 3, and 5 are prime. 4 is merely 2 x 2; and 6 is 2 x 3. 10 is 2 x 5. Prime numbers constitute the periodic table of mathematical elements which can be mixed and matched to form molecules and compounds of enormous size and complexity.Prime numbers become less frequent as numbers get larger. There are fewer in any interval greater than let’s say 1000, than the same interval less than 1000. This is intuitively obvious since the greater the number the more lesser numbers there that might be divided into it evenly. Interestingly, there is always at least one prime between any number and its double.The fun arises because although mathematicians know primes occur less and less frequently as we progress up the scale of numbers, no one knows how to predict when the next one will be encountered. They can be, and have been, calculated to very large numbers indeed, but they can’t be anticipated, only recognised once they appear.* Or should the term be ‘revealed’? Is it any wonder that prime numbers can take on an almost cultic significance? The 18th century philosopher, Denis Diderot, hated both religion and mathematics for the same reason. Both, he felt, provided a veil that obscured reality. Much of today’s popular aversion to mathematics may well be down to this same associative prejudice: if something isn’t immediately obvious or somewhat abstract, it is merely an unverifiable belief or theory and not worthy of respectable thought.There is a good reason for the religious, even spiritual, interpretation of mathematics - particularly number theory, and especially prime numbers. In the first instance, unlike any other area of human inquiry - even theology - the results obtained in mathematics never change. Euclid’s proofs may be superseded by more general analysis but they are nevertheless entirely correct and need no modification in a world of radically different cosmology and technology.Mathematics also shares another characteristic with religion: a concern with aesthetics. Religion orders the world. It provides comprehensibility in a world that might appear otherwise chaotic. And order is an essential component of beauty. Mathematicians not only investigate order as beauty, they collectively insist upon it in their evaluation of their work. A proof or a theorem just isn’t acceptable if it is ugly. The liturgy and art of the Roman Church has no advantage over the aesthetic wonder of the Euler Identity, which connects worlds even further apart than Heaven and Earth.And, it must be said in an era of fake news and rootless factoids, there is nothing quite so practical as a good theory. And mathematics has the best theories - in astronomy, encryption, communications, and logistics to name some of the most obvious areas that are dependent upon them. In fact understanding almost anything at all reported in the press or online demands familiarity with at least the most glaring abuses of mathematical logic.Not all of us, naturally, have the talent or discipline to become mathematicians. But most of us can appreciate the importance of history without being historians, or of engineering without building bridges. The real value of The Music of the Primes is that it inspires an appreciation of, and therefore interest in, the thought and thinkers that are perhaps the purest examples we have of shared human thought; who knows, perhaps cosmic thought. Mathematics - and its heroes like Euler, Gauss and Reimann, and Cauchy, and Godel - belong to all of humanity not just some sect. I find this inspiring. It is more than music; but music will do.*The search for ever larger prime numbers continues. Here is the latest discovery: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/sci..."
1,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Well, aren’t prime numbers really fascinating? If you’re rolling your eyes, then you should read this book. The main subject of the book is the Riemann Hypothesis. You have to be patient if you don’t know what it is. It takes about 100 pages of the book to get to the point where it (sort of) tells you what it is. There’s a particular complex function called zeta function. The zeros of this function can be used to correct a formula by Gauss that approximates the number of prime numbers less than any integer N. The hypothesis is that all these zeros have a real part of ½. Isn’t that fascinating? No? Not yet? Something must be wrong with you. The Riemann Hypothesis has become the most famous unsolved problem in math. There’s a one million dollar prize on it, but don’t quit your job to work on it because the geniuses-among-geniuses of mathematics have failed to crack this problem for 150 years. This book tells their story. There’s a lot of great math history in the book, plus a lot of number theory tidbit that I found fascinating (seriously). Du Sautoy is a great writer. And don’t tell me, Who cares about prime numbers, dude? Your internet encryption works based on modulo calculations on large prime numbers. Thank to them, you can enter your credit card numbers, knowing that even if someone intercepts the data it will be completely useless to them. Also, prime numbers can make you some money – and I’m not talking about the million dollar prize on the Riemann Hypothesis. C.I.A. will pay you 10,000 dollars for every prime number that is 100 digits or larger. Not bad, huh? And there are more 100-digit prime numbers than atoms in the entire known universe. Good luck finding one! "
2,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,5,"There’s surprisingly little maths in this book about an unsolved maths problem, only a few scattered and rather simple equations and some graphs, all of which should be understandable for non-mathematicians. And even if you don’t, you can still follow the text easily. Marcus du Sautoy works a lot with metaphors, which is frowned upon by real mathematicians, but which help to keep the layman in line.So, what’s the deal? In short: a hitherto unsolved problem in the field of number theory, the so called Riemann hypothesis, which the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann mentioned in his paper in 1859, and whose effect, if it ever turns out to be true, will make an important contribution to the understanding of prime numbers and their inner workings (those whole numbers greater than 1 that have no factors other than 1 and the number itself, staring with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, … and of which there are infinitely many). Riemann has assumed that the zeros of a certain (admittedly rather complex) function, the Zeta-function, all lie on a certain critical line. There are an infinite number of these zeros, so one cannot simply determine and check them all with the help of a super computer, because even the most powerful computer cannot perform an infinite number of calculations in a finite time. In order to refute the hypothesis, it would be sufficient to find a single zero outside the critical line. This has been tried over the centuries, but without success: over 100 billion zeros have been checked by now (you can explore them here) and they all fit the hypothesis, but although this strongly suggests the hypothesis is true, it doesn’t count as an acceptable proof in maths.This problem is at the centre of the book. But around it the author builds up a whole cultural history of mathematics. Almost all mathematicians who dealt with prime numbers at some point and made their contributions found their rightful place here. The baton has been handed down over the centuries: Euklid, Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Hilbert, Hardy/Littlewood, Ramanujan, Gödel, Turing, to name but only a few of the best known actors. The book is filled with anecdotal stuff about all of these intriguing characters. In addition, one learns about the current state of cryptography, without which secure Internet communication would not be possible, and in which large prime numbers (100 digits and more) play an essential role.Should you read this? I would say, yes. If you’re interested in the history of maths/science in general (on the basis of a prominent example), I guess it’s hard to come by a presentation that is more simple but has the same high level of seriousness, fun, and sophistication.By the way, if it’s fame and wealth you’re after: The Riemann hypothesis belong to the list of the so called Millennium Prize Problems stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. Solving any of these problems will get you a US$1,000,000 prize and, of course, will give you immortal fame among mathematicians. Good luck!PS.

3,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1497117-noel-bush,5,"I'm most grateful to this book for finally enabling me to understand the Riemann Hypothesis. My love for math was derailed in high school when I got in over my head, and ever since it's always such a pleasure for me to find something that can help me taste some of that world that I missed out on. This book does a wonderful job of taking you through the development of some very cool math by telling the stories of the people who made important discoveries. You get a very clear sense of how mathematics is like one enormous conversation spanning centuries. This may really be the most well-written book on mathematics that I've ever read, and I've been through quite a few. I learned a lot about many mathematicians I had only a passing knowledge of, such as those of the Göttingen school (now I want to take a trip there!). But most exciting of all for me was that I was able to follow along, from the earliest discoveries about prime numbers, right up through the latest work in this century...and although the book never gets technical, I truly feel like the author pulled no punches in laying out the reality of what people have been going after, and why, for all these years."
4,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2554312-bill-ward,3,"This book was at its heart a biography of the Reimann Hypothesis, and of the mathematicians who worked on trying to prove or disprove it over the years. I really liked the way that it showed the relationships among the people involved, and how the centers of number theory research shifted from Paris to Göttingen to Princeton, and how this was caused in large part by the geopolitics of the area (Napoleon and Hitler in particular). But this book has a serious flaw. The math was really dumbed down for this book, with very little attempt to teach any of the concepts involved beyond vague metaphors. I feel that this would be frustrating for anyone with a real interest in math and number theory, and that the topic itself would be of little interest to people without the mathematical background, so I wish the author had given us a little more credit for our math skills (he is a professor of mathematics, so I know he could do it).I suppose in conjunction with a real math book, this could give some interesting insights into the history of our understanding of prime numbers, but I felt ultimately that the lack of real math in the book made it a lot less enjoyable and informative than it could have been."
5,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4318321,5,"The Music of The Primes, a wonderful and amazing journey to the world of prime numbers and patterns it was at the summer of 2009 when i was first introduced to the beauty and strength of the primes when the instructor asked us to implement some factorization problems in my second programming course, it was at that class where he shed a little light on the true beauty of primes talking about RSA encryption which is discussed in a late chapter of the book. almost one year later, i had the chance to dive deeper in the world of primes while studying Number Theory at another course, and what a world it was! this book is concerned about prime numbers, exploring them .. and illustrating the most famous problems related to them. some of which were solved, and some remained unsolved till this day. the most famous problem of them all is The Riemann Hypothesis which is discussed all along the book due to its importance, struggles and implications it will have (if solved) on other problems, mathematics and other sciences like physics.du Sautoy takes the reader into a long journey exposing the ideas of the greatest minds ever, starting from Fermat, moving to Gauss, Riemann, Gödel, the enigma code breaker and father of AI and computing Alan Turing .. and many many others. Marcus is very good at clarifying scientific concepts, he explains the Riemann Hypothesis really well that you grasp the core of it even if you're not a mathematician. i remember i came across the Riemann Hypothesis before reading this book and i tried to understand it by reading its Wikipedia related articles several times, but without having the slightest of idea about it! not until i read this book i understood what it is really about and realized how big its potential is. the book explores The Riemann Hypothesis which is mainly a problem of navigating the primes looking for a pattern. this is a really great book, one of the best i ever read. and i gotta say, du Sautoy's books are better than his documentaries. which reminds me to watch the televised series of this book presented by du Sautoy :D as written on the back of the book, ""A book not to be put down""! cheers! "
6,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,2,I love maths and books on math. But this book just plain bored me to tears. I made it halfway through and could not find any reason to continue.
7,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548376-andrea,5,"You are not going to believe that a book on a math subject would be hard to put down but this book is brilliantly written. I started reading this with doubts I would actually finish and I keep getting hooked into reading the next chapter and the next chapter. The author writes the whole book like this is THE GREATEST treasure hunt ever. He starts out by talking about the million dollar prize for the person who can prove Riemann's Hypothesis. Then he tells the story of how people discovered little pieces of the puzzle and how astonished they were by their discovery and even the reader is astonished. This book is written about the field of math but you don't have to understand everything about the subject to enjoy the book. It is written at a level that anyone can understand. I was intrigued by the title which seems to say that there is a connection between music and prime numbers. When I read the chapter that inspired the title I was literally floored. There really is a sound/frequency associated with each of these ""magical"" numbers that are the building blocks of every other number. The author compares prime numbers to the chemist's Periodic Table except that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The author also explains how if you look at the prime numbers one way they look random, but if you look at them another way, they all line up. For those who like history, this reads like a story."
8,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,5,"How do I love Marcus du Sautoy? Let me count the ways.Nicked this off my dad during my A levels, ended up buying my own copy and taking it to university because I wanted to lend it out to people without him getting upset. It's accessible, broad and fascinating - perfect for the enthusiastic amateur and armchair mathematician.For the record, you may write ""enthusiastic amateur"" on my tombstone."
9,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,4,"Hidden behind this unfortunately ugly cover is a beautiful story about the Riemann Hypothesis and the mathematics around the prime numbers. During my first semester of college my Calculus professor tried to talk me into going into mathematics instead of computer science, and there is a part of me that regrets not having done so, but then I read a book like this, and realize that the minds behind these theorems and proofs are so far beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve that I'm humbled and relieved. Instead I can sit back and occasionally work through a book like this, vicariously enjoying the astonishment, frustration, and brilliance of those who think in these incredibly abstract and abstruse worlds. I loved learning about how the prime numbers tied into quantum theory, and of course I was already familiar with their importance in cryptography. Sautoy does an excellent job of delivering the history with plenty of mathematical depth, and revealing the humanity of the people behind those walls."

For me, having grown up with the internet and extant high-speed transportation systems, I was attracted to physiology because of the analogy I saw between the ""outside"" and ""inside"" worlds...it must have been amazing to build that analogy in reverse, through witnessing the creation of the world's first high-speed transportation and communication systems. It makes me wonder what pther such biological/technological analogies we are witnessing the creation of, that will be come obvious with coming years..."
11,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2219971-des,5,"Wow, I am not mathematically inclined at all but this was a thrill to read. what a talent to bring complex mathematics and the prime numbers to more people. Thanks to Du Sautoy. This book enriched my life."
12,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6098128-huw-evans,4,"Prime numbers are unique; they can only be divided by themselves and the number one. They crop up irregularly as you count upwards and are seemingly wholly unpredictable in their occurrence. There is an infinite number of them and they appear to be as important in life, the universe and everything as the numbers in the Fibonacci series.There seems to be an inherent need in mathematics to rationalise and predict with a level of accuracy that goes beyond the normal. Only if the sun can be proved to have risen every day for an infinite number of days will a mathematician be happy to tell you that the sun rises. He may not be able to tell you why it rises or what the impact of its rising is but he will be happy to tell you that, under certain circumstances, it will rise every morning.In 1859 Bernard Reimann published his hypothesis on prime numbers; that the real part of any non trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2. It was apparently proven by Riemann himself but the proof was never found, reportedly burned by his housekeeper when tidying up after his death. Since then many mathematicians have devoted their efforts to providing enough evidence that this is true. Even with the advent of supercomputers and the finding of prime numbers with a million digits, which still fulfil the hypothesis, it has not been proven satisfactorily. Attempts to disprove it have been equally unsuccessful by not finding a single prime number that doesn't behave in this way.So far, so good. I am not a mathematician and, even now, I could not explain to you the derivation and use of a zeta function - there may be none for all I know. This is a book as much about mathematicians as it is about their subject matter, and they are every bit as fascinating. These are people who are so driven by the abstract that they seem to want to find the rules that govern even the most random events using a language that has evolved in huge leaps to the point of being unrecognisable by ordinary men.Marcus de Sautoy speaks clearly throughout this book and the mathematics is not overpowering. In fact I found the most interesting section was the application of prime number mathematics to internet security and cryptography. At the end of the book, I confess, no mathematical light had clicked on in my head and some of even the most basic stuff left me puzzled but, overall, this is an impressive, erudite and coherent read."
13,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3462402-aaron-humphrey,4,"I was fascinated with prime numbers myself for years. Many of my classmates could (if they had been paying attention) attest to the fact that I spent much of my class time, in high school math and many university courses, factorizing random 7- and 8-digit numbers, often when I really should have been paying attention and taking notes. I had the primes up to at least 200 memorized. I often wondered if there were easier ways to factorize, and I'm still not convinced there are, though apparently there are easier ways to determine whether a number is prime or not. So this book pricked my interest immediately.This book covers a lot of different topics about prime numbers, moving quickly into general statements and conjectures, and spends a lot of time at the heart of the prime number problem, the Riemann Hypothesis. It has something to do with a function (the Riemann zeta function) having an infinite number of zeroes on the complex plane, and whether those zeroes are all on the same line or not. The implications of this go over my head (I didn't get that far in complex analysis, sadly), but I gather that proving the Hypothesis could lead to, say, an easy way to generate prime numbers, and thus, potentially, an easy way to break RSA encryption.It strikes about the right balance between the math and the mathematicians. One seldom thinks of how, for instance, the French Revolution or World War I impact the progress of mathematics (as opposed to, say, physics). As someone who's gone far enough in university math to understand most, if not all, of the concepts in the book, I found it enlightening, though I am both filled with respect for the mathematicians who made the discoveries in the book and more certain I could never really be one of them. I remember seeing some kind of PBSish show on TV (in our hotel room in Orlando) about the Riemann Hypothesis, which was so overdramatized that it felt like ""Behind The Math"". It spent more time on the failures, the people whose careers were blighted by trying to prove the Hypothesis, not to mention John ""Beautiful Mind"" Nash's disastrous public breakdown while lecturing on the subject. I enjoyed this much more, but then, I'd rather read a nonfiction book than watch a documentary any day. Maybe not for the faint of math, though I can't really judge."
14,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18654747-shadab-zafar,5,"Mathematicians feel like characters and the course of history feels like a fictional story beautifully woven by du Sautoy.This is the story of an outcast, a loner, who in his ten paged paper made a little hunch. It, also is, a story of an indian clerk who believed that a goddess was responsible for his contributions to mathematics. The story of a city which was home to some of the greatest mathematicians. A story of how the atoms of arithmetic lie at the heart of modern e-business.But most of all, this is the story of a problem, which, since its formulation in 1859 has baffled the greatest of minds - The Riemann Hypothesis.Many have devoted their entire career in search for a solution, only to find nothing. Many loved it so much that they didn't want to die before a proof was presented. Many have gone crazy in the search, never to return back.But the hypothesis still stands strong. Some believe its time has come while others feel that it'll survive its bicentenary. Some believe it is false where other think that it is true but unprovable.The hypothesis, having originated from pure arithmetic, has found its way to quantum mechanics and chaos theory and a proof would have far reaching consequences.If you have the slightest of interest in mathematics, this book is a must read."

17,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76195294-joel-george,4,"I was a little apprehensive about reading the latter part of The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics, when it got a little weary, and I went through a few discouraging reviews I found here on the style of writing it followed. But I must say, that I am glad I stuck to my instincts, without letting too much room for empty prejudice to put a damper on the experience.I am by no means anything more than a dilettante in rigorous mathematics, but I thoroughly enjoy subjecting myself to the enchanting sway that it, and Number theory in particular, seem to possess. For me, this is very much like enjoying music without delving too deep into the intricacies that accompany its creation. The theatre needs both the master and his audience for a performance to be complete. The difference though, is that with mathematics, the delight is primarily of the author, and rarely translates to the masses because of the unrelenting veil of complexity involved. Considering the ensuing difficulty of striking and maintaining a balance between amateur-friendly and enticingly original, Marcus du Sautoy has done a remarkable job with the subject.The book is a historical journey through mankind's tussle with prime numbers. It is replete with all the exciting plot twists that led to arguably the greatest open problem in number theory, - The Riemann Hypothesis - and the implications its solution might bear for the future. It's not perfect, nothing ever is, but I would recommend it to anyone with a curiosity to the world of numbers and patterns. You just have to bear with a few bumps along the journey where you're left yearning for more or wishing you can circumnavigate. But it will not take away from what is, otherwise, an exhilarating story line that runs through the heart of Number theory."

I'm a bit biased here, since I like math, and have some idea about the subject matter. If you know a bit about prime counting, logarithms, modular arithmetic and quantum mechanics, you can't put this down. Even the people who don't like math might find it interesting, it is so well written. The language is lucid, and even complicated mathematical concepts are presented in a way that is easy to understand. In fact, he never uses the equation of the hypothesis, explaining everything through simple words. The only formula used is an amusing (view spoiler)[prime generating formula that uses all 26 letters of the alphabet (hide spoiler)]. More than just the history of the hypothesis, this book is a journey through the development of modern mathematics, how ideas formed and spread, how world wars slowed down the breakthroughs and overall, how brilliant minds work. Strongly recommended for anyone who likes science, and has heard of the Riemann hypothesis!"
19,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2291965-tim,0,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is reasonably well written, and provides fascinating insights both into the history of mathematics and into the strange world of modern number theory. As a result, it helped change my view of what maths is, and realise that it should be a fascinating journey of discovery, a million miles away from the dry routine of calculation and prescribed problem-solving I remember from school. On the other hand, I have to admit that most of the maths was over my head, and I felt a little frustrate that the author skirted round much of it instead of trying to explain it. If the maths is really too complicated for a general reader like me (and maybe it is) then should it really be the subject of a popular science book like this?"

Hardly any maths involved so a easy and fast read. Not much more to say as there are already many great reviews already written about it but in particular I liked the clear explanation of how modulus arithmetic and cryptography (RSA system) works. If you desire to learn more about the Riemann hypothesis or are thinking about reading ""Prime Obsession, Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics"" then I think one would be well advised to read this book first to prepare the ground. I guess this the kind of book that makes maths so sexy. "

But The Music of the Primes presents a lucid, unbiased look at the evolution of prime number theory, not just Reimann's most famous take on the problem. It gets a little heavy at the end (as most great math books do) with the evolution of parallel processing and the subsequent exponential growth of digits, but it's still one of my top-five essential math books."

I would like to believe it was due to the abysmal, 'learn-by-rote and don't explore' method that I was forced to follow in the rat-race to pick a career. It is extremely unfortunate that I ended up quitting the subject with quite some vitriol, but it is even more unfortunate that I have begun to discover, a little too late, the very subject's beauty. Well, better late than never, right?But hey, if I really hated mathematics, I should have never looked again at a book that extolled it. Maybe I wanted to redeem myself? Nah! Some part of me probably wanted to give it another chance despite the fact that it always tried to bring me down (all those damn exams!). Anyway, it was with some haughtiness that I gave into this book. ""Stupid mathematicians-I thought-trying to build something really difficult out of something as simple as 1,2,3...stupid theorems, stupid proofs that ended with 'hence proved'""-the rants in my head wouldn't end. I never saw the beauty of primes, never thought them special, actually I never really thought of them after high school. It didn't help that the book is written by a professor of mathematics who gushes over the subject somewhat unabashedly and with seemingly low regard for other disciplines. Sample this- ""Those names [certain mathematicians] will live long after we have forgotten the likes of Aeschylus, Goethe and Shakespeare"". This is just an absurd argument to me and something I completely disagree with. Really intelligent, well-read people will remember both mathematicians and bards alike, not to mention other significant scientists and artists. A really small point, but it began to put me off the writing, until I began to really get into why the Riemann Hypothesis is such a big deal and the interesting history of mathematics (I think the history more than the math part of it was interesting to me until a certain point and then maths soon began to catch up). It was interesting to get into the minds of these brilliant mathematicians and read about how math played a role in their lives. It was nostalgic reading about the zillions of theorems that I had touched upon in another life and I felt incredibly patriotic reading about the contributions of Indian mathematicians and-believe it or not-a certain quote by an eminent British mathematician that the Indian education system played a huge role in honing his skills! (Wow, was it just me then?)But most of all, it was fascinating to read about the unknown primal beat and how knowledge of at least a few of the prime numbers' secrets, starting with the Riemann Hypothesis may be linked to quantum theory and eventually a better understanding of the universe. I enjoyed the rare glimpses of humor in the author's writing [for e.g. while referring to the strange case of the autistic twins in Oliver Sacks book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat & Other Clinical Tales -""Before anyone could find out how they were doing it, the twins were separated at the age of thirty-seven by their doctors, who believed that their private numerological language had been hindering their development. Had they listened to the arcane conversations that can be heard in the common rooms of university maths departments, these doctors would probably have recommended closing them down too""]. However, the constant reminders of monetary benefits to solving problems of such significance were a bit of a turn off. Isn't eternal fame enough?I feel like this book deserved the 4 stars I gave it, because despite some disagreement with his tone, I overall agreed with Prof. du Sautoy in that I was completely wrong in dismissing mathematics as a boring subject with no value in real life except for simple arithmetic calculations. "
32,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"I was a bit annoyed reading reviews of this book at first, because several compare it with Simon Singh's ""Fermat's Last Theorum"", and for the most part they agree that it's not quite as good. Dammit; Singh's book is the only other maths related book I've read, and I was hoping this insight into the world of prime numbers would be as good - or at least as interesting - as that. Well I suppose you can't have everything. Or can you?Having finished it now, I have to admit that comparisons with ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" are entirely appropriate, not least because both books cover a lot of the same history. Unfortunately for Marcus du Sautoy, Simon Singh does it slightly more compellingly.There's more maths in ""The Music of the Primes"", and while I can't really blame du Sautoy for that - it does seem entirely necessary - it does make it slightly harder to enjoy his book. It basically involves looking at a formula, not understanding it, reading the description, not really understanding that either, and then reading on, hoping it will all make sense later - kind of what it was like in maths class at school. A large part of the narrative depends on the ""zeta function"", and I'm sorry to say I just didn't get a handle on that at all. I had to just accept it as an important thing that I'd never understand, and try not to let it ruin the story. It didn't really ruin the story, but it would have been a lot better if I'd been able to understand it. So maybe it did, reading that last sentence back...The history is quite interesting and the characters compelling, though as a non-mathematician you almost have to ask whether it's all a big red herring. I suppose it can't be given that so many careers and years have been devoted to this idea of prime numbers. Are they really a thing, or is maths an entirely human construct? This isn't really explored in the text. As a mathematician himself, du Sautoy accepts the reality of numbers and all they can possibly mean. After all, this isn't a philosophical piece, but a porthole into the world of pure maths.So yes, I enjoyed it (but not as much as Singh's ""Fermat's Last Theorem""). As I said, I quite liked the history elements, but the story lost its way a bit for me when it came to the sections on cryptography. Luckily it picks up again when parallels with quantum physics emerge. I've read a bit on quantum physics of late, and those bits were right up my street. Ultimately it's sad that the story isn't finished; revelations and progress have come to an end (or had at the time of publication). So in the end, there's still a mystery to be solved. Perhaps this is du Sautoy's attempt at inspiring a whole new generation to set their minds to the problem.As it stands, the highest known prime is apparently 2 to the power of 74,207,281, a number with 22,338,618 digits and it was found using one of the methods described in this book. That's pretty interesting, and this book is pretty interesting too. I can imagine it being a bit too much for some people, but if you think you might be interested in how the world of mathematics works, give it a go."
33,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055546-tom-hudson,3,"I got a lot out of du Sautoy’s history of mathematics’ greatest unsolved mystery, but I still wish there had been more. A fantastic history of the places and faces of specific mathematical fields of study, it started with some juicy mathematical tidbits explaining the concepts and their importance. But, as the mathematics became more advanced, any attempt to explain the underlying concepts became vaguer and more reliant on unwieldy analogies, almost to the point of blandness.Calling the Riemann Hypothesis an ‘unsolved mystery’ isn’t quite the right terminology. Rather, it is a very strong conjecture regarding the nature of prime numbers that has since become the part of the connective fabric of thousands of other theorems in number theory. The hypothesis has a great deal of evidence to support it but it has never been demonstrated through a connection of axioms, theorems, and other proofs tying it directly into the foundations of mathematical logic. As such, all of the theorems that depend on it are in a similar state of “we have every reason to believe this is true EXCEPT for the most important condition of having proved it to be true.”The author does a very good job of painting portraits of the figures involved in studying prime numbers and the importance of those special numbers in the pantheon of pure mathematical thought, connecting them also to the practical applications of information security and beyond. The subject, though, is so broad and the specifics so deep, it’s hard not to sense that we are only getting a glimpse into the connectedness of the topics. He also uses analogies to help envision certain concepts, but then opts to refer to those analogies going forward instead of using the accepted mathematical terms (“sea level of a landscape” instead of “the zeroes of the function” or referring to clock calculators instead of modular arithmetic, or the beating of a drum as a metaphor for… I’m not even sure what, because the analogy seemed so flimsy: the distribution patterns of probabilistic functions, I think?). I understand the book is written for laypersons, and while I myself have a certain mathematical knowledge, I am no mathematician. However, I would have enjoyed a little more trust in the reader’s intellect to follow along without constantly falling back on the simpler, almost banal conceptualization of this topic which du Sautoy is clearly.In the end, it was a worthwhile read, and I learned much about the history of mathematics and SOME of the specifics of the Riemann Hypothesis. I feel, though, that in du Sautoy’s attempt to share his passion, he may have simplified it a step or two too far and some of the magic of mathematics he could have conveyed with more precise language ultimately became lost in translation. "
34,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6560235-jocelyn,4,"I've been interested in numbers ever since I can remember. Math was always my favorite subject in school, and I majored in it in college. I don't do a lot of math anymore, with the exception of the odd algebra problem on my page a day calendar, but I enjoy reading about the history of math. A couple of years ago my son gave me a book on the Reimann Hypothesis, Prime Obsession Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics. It was a fascinating book, but had a lot of math that was beyond me. It took me months to finish it because, even though I enjoyed it, I fell asleep whenever I read it! About a month ago, I was looking for something to read and came across The Music of the Primes. It looked interesting, it was about number theory, so I gave it a go. It turns out that it was about the Reimann Hypothesis, or, more accurately, about the mathemeticians that were working to prove it. The author, Du Sautoy, only included enough advanced math to explain the problems, and he explained it in layman's terms, so it was much easier to read for someone without a graduate degree in math. He goes into a lot of detail about the history of the problem, the politics that have gotten in the way and in some ways, changed the course of Mathematical history. From Germany to France to England to India to the US, the story of the Reimann Hypothesis travels the globe. The search for a proof has deepend the number theorists' understanding of numbers as well as brought math and physics together. It has even created the security systems in use on the Interent that allow us to shop and do our banking safely. Fascinating book.(Bernard Reimann proposed the hypothesis in 1859 and it remains unproved. Some think it will never be proved.)"
35,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061431-alex-jones,2,"I think I read this book at the wrong time - if I had read it during GCSEs I'm sure I'd have loved it, during sixth form I'd still have liked it a lot. However, the summer before entering the third year of a maths degree is the wrong time for a pop-maths book. This book details Riemann's famous hypothesis about the prime numbers from before its conception to modern day and it does a good job of telling a historical story. Some details seem like padding and some a little too apocryphal, but it does provide a firm historical look at the prime numbers. Unfortunately, for me, there was just far too little maths involved and the brief explanations given are in unfamiliar terminology. Concepts are explained using terms easily understood by the lay-person, but these terms are not then switched to the common mathematical names meaning that I found I had to translate everything. An example is modular arithmetic is called clock arithmetic and the real line of the Argand diagram is the East-West line. So, it isn't anything too terrible, but when these terms are used frequently I did find it a bit grating. What I would have loved is perhaps an appendix which provides more detailed and technical explanations/proofs of theorems, etc. mentioned. I often found myself when near my computer switching to Wikipedia to look something up properly. I know that some of these topics are extremely difficult to understand, but when some things covered at A level are barely looked at I feel it verges too far to the side of simplification. My last complaint is that maybe a fifth of the book felt like padding, with many sentences just feeling like their words are there to increase the length. Overall if you're interested in the history without wanting much maths then you should give this book a read, but if you want the maths as well then I'd suggest giving this a miss."
36,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10712377-david,4,"(4.5 stars) Let me first say that I didn't much like this edition - the font was not to my liking, the illustrations were poor, and the print came off on my fingers. So I downloaded the e-book version onto my iPhone, which resulted in a much better reading experience. Having said made that point, this is a fascinating book, requiring little or no prior mathematical knowledge, although obviously you need to be interested in the topic. The reader is taken on a grand tour of the past 200 years of number theory, right up to the current day (almost), with occasional diversions into the role of primes in areas such as cybersecurity. The book makes the point that France lost its place as the pre-eminent place for mathematics research when Napoleon insisted that it serve the needs of the state and the military - something that modern governments should take note of. For more than 100 years Göttingen was the centre of activity until the mathematical faculty there was pretty much destroyed by the Nazis. Cambridge has played a role in number theory, but now the place to be is Princeton. This book is about attempts to prove or disprove the Riemann conjecture, which says that all zeros of the zeta function have real part=1/2 (apart from trivial zeros). Amazingly this is related to the distribution of the prime numbers, and if it were proved would for many mathematicians be almost a proof of the existence of God. Many mathematicians have tried to prove the Riemann Conjecture but so far all have failed. It is now regarded as such a difficult problem that many mathematicians steer clear of it rather than attempt to solve it, and fail. It may even be impossible to prove given the current fundamental axioms of mathematics. On the plus side there is the lure of eternal fame and a prize of $1M for the first person to come up with a proof (I think it should be a prime number of $)."
37,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119271-graycastle,3,"This was a lot of fun for me, because I'm one of those who is really interested in math, but has no formal training in it. It's probably best classified as a work of history rather than a work of math; it tracks the history of investigation into prime numbers from the time of Ancient Greece to the present. If you're wondering what's up with that Riemann hypothesis thing, this is a good source; it explains the history of the concept, Riemann's work, and the fallout since. I really like the historical eye that the novel has - the author has such affection for all of these historical mathematicians, and it comes through in the way he presents their lives, their flaws, their loves. Especially, in my opinion, in the bits about Hardy and Ramanujan, but it's possible that I've got a soft spot for gay interracial Edwardian mathematicians at Cambridge. But he's also a big fan of describing all the practical jokes, the moments of epiphany, the wacky friendships - all the humanity of this long investigation. Which is all to say, this book is almost a work of ethnography about the crazy, wonderful, obsessive, ridiculous tribe of mathematicians.The explanations of the math are easy to follow and straightforward, for the most part; I never really struggled with any of the concepts. Which is kind of the reason it doesn't get four stars - every time I started to get interested in some of the math, du Satoy would pull back. I really think the book would've done better to include some of the more complex concepts and mathematical details, because as it is, it's a little frustrating. I recommend it heartily, but not if you want a detailed understanding of specific concepts. As an introduction to the subject, it's perfect."
38,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,4,"This is a pretty neat book giving a social and mathematical history of the development of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), a conjecture explaining the distribution of prime numbers posited in 1859. Lots and lots of mathematicians, and some physicists, are discussed, including their thoughts on the beauty of mathematics and often a lengthy biography of how they came to be mathematicians and be involved in the RH. The author explains all math at a very abstract, analogical level, comparing it to landscapes or physical movement of some kind. It might give a good idea of how the problems feel to mathematicians, but I wish it had given a little better treatment of how the Riemann zeta function and other important concepts work. It describes the graph of the function using North/South and East/West, and describes the height as mountain ranges and points at sea level. The book was mostly very interesting, chronicling the lives of mathematicians living during a lot of global change, political, ideological, and technological. The account of the Nazi takeover and subsequent movement of the mathematical Mecca from Germany to the US, I found very interesting. However, the large number of characters and biographical sketches involved sometimes dragged.By the end of the book, I was feeling very excited about mathematics, and very annoyed that they don't teach real math in school (they teach calculation). I'm really excited for the RH to be solved! Hopefully it's in my lifetime sometime. "
39,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16958-dan,4,"As much as I think popular science is as a genre futile and mostly poorly executed, I think popular math nonfiction is very interesting and well done. Popular math nonfiction books are more often accurate while packing a lot of relevant information.This book is about the history of the Riemann hypothesis, an unproven statement in mathematics that relates a function of complex numbers to the distribution of the primes. Specifically, if the Riemann hypothesis were true, there is a function which perfectly identifies which integers are prime.This is surprising in mathematics, because as objects of mathematical study the integers are very different than complex numbers, and the mathematical tools and disciplines that have developed to study these respective subjects are very different.This book does a very good job of discussing the history of the problem as well as the problem itself. It also goes into details of the people who have made the most notable attempts to solve this problem and this gives the book a nice human element. This book is reasonably clearly written given the subject material (I don't know how people with out a math background would do reading it.) The book is organized well and reading it flows well. I read this book because I like number theory and wanted to learn more about the Riemann hypothesis."
40,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9914220-david,5,"Numbers have some unusual properties, and mathematicians have a long history of being curious about those properties. The Music of the Primes is a non-technical book which traces the study of prime numbers and the major characters who have made contributions to our understanding of them. The primes aren't the only theme here. Along the way we find the shifting tides in mathematics from foundational issues to the practical usefulness of what were once considered purely academic pursuits. Some of the milestones along the way come with rather hefty financial rewards such as a proof of the Goldbach Conjecture that every even number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. While it can be stated very simply, and anybody can test it as far up the integers as one chooses to go, a rigorous proof is not as easy as stating the proposition. I enjoyed this book. At times, I had to stop and play with some of the ideas when they were presented in more detailed ways. My brain took a natural spin down Feynman's rabbit hole in mulling over how computers do not preserve input being like non-commutative geometry. Drums, I had never really thought about drums. Resonance and overtones and harmonics, but not drums. What a brilliant set of observations! Yes, I did enjoy this book. "
41,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9236862-david,4,"It took me a while to read this but it was very enjoyable for someone who has a bit of a thing about maths at the moment. It tells of the human fascination with prime numbers (really?); the building blocks of mathematics and especially with the search to find a pattern to predict their frequency. The Riemann Hypothesis is the best description so far; proposed in 1859, there is a million pounds awaiting the person who finally proves it.The book deals with all the major characters who have contributed so far, each with their very human stories to tell from the young French blade who stayed up all night to write up his work before going to meet his doom in a duel to another young French man who was sentenced to death as a spy only to be reprieved on the basis of a chance meeting the night before is date with the firing squad.All the usual annoyances of reading non-fiction books on the kindle apply with no pictures (including the graphs and diagrams referred to in the text) and poor display of equations.Still very enjoyable but an interest in maths is probably beneficial."

He makes it all into a thrilling read and even though I know a thing or two about prime numbers and their history, I learned a ton of new things.That being said, there were two small things I did not enjoy: 1) Du Sautoy often describes how the mathematicians felt, what their aims was and other rather personal aspects of lives of people we know little about. There is little to no proof of this being true. 2) Some passages are a little too long as the author makes even the littlest of details into fascinating stories. Makes the book a little long for my taste.So while an enjoyable read, don't expect a raw list of facts, rather a well described history with no loose ends, sometimes a bit too descriptive. Nevertheless, admirable job, du Sautoy must've spent quite some time collecting all the links and quotes."

Riemann's hypothesis is explained (not analitically however) after about 100 pages, but the first chapters are fundamental to comprehend the theory (and history) behind the protagonist.I liked so much this story because it has given me the curiosity to watch over other number theory arguments (I'm a freshman in CS, so it would become an important subject to study for me) like criptography, and showed that there are many fields in math that aren't taught at high school but are primary in everyday life (like RSA, which is always used, for example, by social network and bank websites) and that can't work without the mathematicians shown in this book.Definitely, a must have for who's intrested (and not) in a problem that has involved 150 years of math."

It's definitely on the history side, but doesn't assume you know anything much about either one. It's centered on the Riemann Hypothesis, which from what this book says is the longest-standing unsolved math problem of its importance. Bernhard Riemann first proposed it in 1859. The conjecture is that the only complex numbers that give a value of 0 for a certain function have a real part of 1/2, and if true it would have important consequences for the study of prime numbers. There's a bit of what I consider fluff, metaphors that are more flashy than helpful and irrelevant anecdotes about mathematicians, but it didn't seem to get in the way of the substance. In fact, the book seemed very good at conveying in general terms what theorems are about without getting nearly formal enough to state them."

Many of the same characters turn up, but whereas the Fermat problem was easy to state, the Riemann Hypothesis is more difficult to explain. Still, I think I understand what it is about, now.However, this book fell a bit short for me. Singh had appendices that explained a bit further some of the maths that would halt the narrative if put into the text. Du Sautoy just leaves things hanging in the air. For instance, in the section explaining the importance of prime numbers to internet encryption, he mentions Fermat's factorisation method, but no explanation of what it is or how it works. I had to google it and mathematically it is very simple. I'm surprised I'd never come across it before."

Especially in the first few chapters when they are delving into some of the baseline mathematics, I would have to stop and take a breather every few pages to absorb what I had read.Where the book really picked up for me was when they started tracing the history of the Riemann Hypothesis- who worked on it, who contributed, who went crazy- and the stories of each mathematician. I found that fascinating- and it only made me want to explore more.I also really enjoyed the connections between these primes and sound waves, computing, electrical engineering, quantum physics, cryptology and computer security, etc. Really a fascinating read for any student of mathematics... and any teacher who wants to convey to their students ""how we use this stuff""."

This delves far more into the history of the subject, which is interesting and useful in its own way.It's always strange, however, to read a math book and get the vibe that the writer is afraid too much math will scare off his readers. I think if it had just a touch more, it would have been perfect, but after reading the book once-through I was still confused what the function R(primes) was, only knew that it existed and helped predict primes using the zeta function zeroes as a correction, which seems a shame when it is so important to the subject, and I had to go to another book to figure that out in more detail.Read this if you are interested in mathematical history and like the math kept simple."

Du Sautoy covers the history of prime numbers and the Riemann hypothesis in enough detail that you come away feeling like you have at least an understanding of the broad strokes of the picture - why this is important, why it's interesting, why it's relevant. That's harder to achieve than most people give credit for, given how abstract and esoteric the actual maths is. Sure, the maths itself isn't delved into in much detail, but there are endless resources out there for people who want that kind of thing. If you're after a book that delves into the details of the Riemann hypothesis and attempts at solutions, this obviously isn't the book for you.

It was both informative and entertaining to read about the famous mathematicians of the past and how they built off of each others' work.

Just like poetry, sometimes you just want to savor the actual thing rather than read paragraphs trying to describe it to you.The book is remarkably up to date, even talking about the PRIMES algorithm that was discovered when I was in college.

If you like this book and also like fiction, you should check out Red Zen by Jason Earls. The author of that book obviously loves primes too.

Linking the whole history of the exploration of prime numbers, which mostly comes down to trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis, together with the background and biography of the mathematicians involved, the reasons why they were exploring this problem, and modern day real world applications makes it really interesting though.

It is an extremely erudite and extensive coverage of one of the most intriguing and fundemental science questions and the primary unsolved problem of math. It is akin to reading a crime novel.

I expected to learn some basic mathematical ideas about the Riemann Hypothesis, but the book contains pretty much only historical anecdotes. Annoyingly, many mathematical concepts are used in anecdotes without a definition/explanation, and the reader is presumably supposed to not worry about what they actually mean (most obviously: what does ""the first N zeroes"" mean when they are complex numbers? It is never explained, even though there is a whole chapter on calculating just that.)"
58,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16485422-lisa,3,"I really loved the first 200 pgs. A wonderful winding description of the rise and progress of the math of primes. By focusing on the people and their thinking the story really sings. I found the number theory descriptions great and very clear (I do have math training from college).However, I thought the last 100 pgs felt very different by focusing on the computer methods and applications not the people. Also the focus on RSA encryption showed the book's age.Great book for people who see the beauty in mathematics."
59,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664866-alvin,4,"A great overview of the history behind the Reimann Hypothesis. I learned a few new and surprising things, that a formula for the primes does exist and is formed by the locations of the zeroes on critical line of the zeta function and that at very large numbers, the distribution of the zeroes resembles the eigenvalues of the excitation states of atomic nuclei, a very unexpected connection between the abstract and reality.

274,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58851414-markusq,4,"I was initially disappointed when I realized this was a ""math as soap opera"" book (more focus on the personal lives of the discoverers than on their discoveries) but it was quite well written and ultimately worth it. Although I was hoping for something more like Riemann's Zeta Function I quite enjoyed this."
275,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16206996-tom-grimwood-taylor,3,"3½. An interesting history of the progress towards understanding the primes. I'd have preferred a deeper look at the maths behind what was talked about rather than just analogies. I doubt I'd have understood much since I lack a sufficiently mathematical background, but it's frustrating that it all remains such a mystery to me after finishing the book. Perhaps it simply isn't a topic that can be addressed adequately in a popular science book."
276,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12834433-cyd,4,"This was bedtime reading, so it took me months to finish it. Nevertheless, the story was always compelling when I picked it up, even if I had been away from it for a while. Du Sautoy made the history of discoveries about prime numbers read like an exciting epic saga--which it really has been. Even when I didn't totally understand exactly what the discoveries were, the story was exciting. Also enjoyed the Britishisms throughout (du Sautoy is a maths professor at Oxford)."
277,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/168143-steven,5,"A fascinating book that demonstrated a baffling connection between abstract mathematics and the real world. Its description of prime number theory and its evolution was excellent. If you enjoy abstract thought, mathematics, and wish to broaden your understanding of the universe, I highly recomment this book.."
278,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/926017-matt-wood,5,This book was great. It does a wonderful job of introducing the Riemann Hypothesis to the mathematical layman. So many interesting people and ideas are discussed along the way toward this explaination; the history behind these discoveries is fascinating. Very happy I went looking for it in my dusty stack of books.
279,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932035-moshe-zioni,5,"I finished this book in a few intense days, just couldn't let go of it. As a math student it is a thrill to read with such passion and ease this kind of material, which really depends on it's good presentation of issues and this kind of writing is not to take as granted with such a widely-considered-dull subjects.Very recommended to every popular mathematics hobbist or casual reader."
280,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6048596-christin,5,"Engaging journey through mathematics-the writing style is fantastic and the content interesting. I bought this book with high hopes (a ex-mathlete pursuing abandoned mathematical interest), but then shelved it for over a year. When I picked it up again I was hesitant (i.e. intimidated) but so glad I did! Du Satoy's enthusiasm for the subject matters pours out of every page."
281,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5967703-ep,3,"Although interesting on the point of being a treatise on mathematical history of anything related to prime numbers, I found the prose and the discourse of the book heavy (I dozed off a few times). I would have liked more technical facts. The anectodes were funny but carried out like a misfired joke. When compared to the Fermat's enigma, I would definitively recommend the second one."
282,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5736143-maya,2,"I was so eager to read this book (i really do want to know more about prime numbers!)Alas, Du Sautoy seems like a really cool guy, and he may be a good teacher and science-show host, but he is not a good writer. The book was impossible to follow, had no flow to it, and i had to give up after a couple of chapters. Too bad :("
283,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28328095-manel,4,"This book doesn't only show you how great prime numbers are, it provides you a complete idea of how all the great mathematical minds around the world had contributed to finalize a huge and important theory which is the Numbers Theory, and without this beautiful theory, cryptography would never exist ...and all the business based on it .."
284,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22229546-abhinav-dave,4,"Enjoyed it! Apart from the well laid-out historical account of mathematicians' attack on the prime number hypothesis, what was interesting was the vivid portrayal of various mathematicians themselves. Almost all of them seemed to have rather interesting personalities, or it is simply a testament to the literary skills of Du Sautoy!"
285,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28902492-austin-wright-pettibone,3,"A good book overall, but a bit tedious. Reads like a who's who of number theorists who've worked on Riemann's problem. My interest in the subject sustained me throughout the book, but I was left wanting more. It could have been strengthened with more in depth explanations of the math involved, rather than the people who developed the math."
286,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13686768-matthew-murawski,4,"This was a really fun read. du Sautoy makes the history of the primes a fascinating adventure with mathematicians throughout history picking up the torch and contributing a little more to our understanding of these remarkable numbers. While he does get a little scattered at points, it does all tie together pretty well. "
287,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12506326-aileen-noura-vitarelli,4,"An extraordinary explanation on Reimann Hypothesis and the Riemann Zeta Function on trivial zero and non trivial zero. The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann, zeta function in Fermat Prime Numbers etc. The Professor Marcus Du Sautoy explored the historical part of prime numbers from Euclid, Gauss, Andrew Weil and Ramanujan to name a few. "
288,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2356369-edward-bradburn,4,"A great introduction to the Riemann Hypothesis. The only reason I gave it 4/5 was that I thought it could have been a teeny bit shorter than it was. It was fun reading it in German though, since all the quotes from Gauß and Co. were in the original language :=)"
289,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"A wonderful book about prime numbers, and the so-called Riemann Hypothesis. This book is more about the history and the personalities than the detailed mathematics, although the author does give a sense of the mathematics involved. Fascinating!Highly recommended!"
290,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995046-simon-hampton,0,I loved this book. Du Suatoy does a pretty good job of describing one of the central problems of mathematics and the work towards proving it (as yet unfinished). But he makes it so readable by being biographical about the great mathematicians over the ages.
291,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8162848-jase,5,"I bought this book after seeing several of Marcus du Sautoy's BBC TV shows where he is always both entertaining and informative. This book is no different, it's sometimes hard going, but always a pleasure to read."
292,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793-alan-dean,5,"I'm no mathematician, but I loved this book. It is a page-turner I couldn't put down (yes, really!). Told with excellent pace, I never lost interest and was always wondering what the next page would tell me of this fascinating story."
293,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14614268-sean-elvidge,3,"An enjoyable read, as a mathematician. I'm not sure how well this would go down with a non-maths kind of person, unlike Simon Singh's book on Fermat's Last Theorem, there is quite a bit of maths in this book."
294,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18892445-brian-collins,4,A great book for general reader with an interest in math. du Sautoy tells a good story and lays the numbers out without it's feeling really dumbed down (which of course it must be!). My idea of great beach reading.
295,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28889695-chris,3,"It was a good book, but I felt like the author could barely contain his distain for religion. It's difficult to understand anything about Riemann the man without understanding his devotion to God. So my recommendation would be to try Prime Obsession instead."
296,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11609092-mohamed,5,"This is one of the most enjoyable books you can read, only under one condition, you need to love the magic of mathematics.The book sail with you in the history of humanity and secrets behind prime numbers. With a lot of life examples from nature, you will love the mathematics breeze!"
297,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63086025-danielle,5,This is a beautiful book about the Riemann Hypothesis. It is a must read for every math history lover out there. Marcus du Sautoy does a great job telling a story that spans over three centuries and many of the great mathematicians there ever have been. I loved it and would recommend. 
298,0060935588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802922-brannon,5,This is a math history book explaining a lot of the development of research in prime numbers. It's a little older but still well written and interesting.
