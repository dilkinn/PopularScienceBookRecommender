0,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"This wildly ambitious graphic novel is a fictional (auto?)biography of Bertrand Russell and traces his journey from doubt to certainty and back again. It is littered with the lofty ideas of the many giants of mathematics and philosophy throughout, but is never daunting in its subject matter or too overreaching in its objectives. A list of the co-stars might be enough to induce you to stop reading this review, so I restrain myself from indulging.The self-referential presentation, which shows the creators struggling with the same questions, helps the readers get into the real spirit of the 'Quest' and enjoy the ride and its uncertainties instead of agonizing over the answers that are guaranteed to never come in any case. The comic sags a bit once the obsession with the theme of 'logicians and madness' threatens to run away with it and obscure the real story. But, the precisely mad and inanely confident Side-Kick to our Super Hero (read Russell) comes traipsing into the story with perfect timing and livens up the story and thickens the plot into a right stew. With Wittgenstein thus in the mix, Russell gets comfy in being true to his character (destiny?) and takes us to the logical conclusion of the pursuit of Truth - to Philosophy. Fittingly enough, the story concludes with the legendary closing scene of Oresteia, which perhaps makes the whole experience more profound than it really deserved to be, but then that is the fun of great ideas - you never know when they are only pretending!"
1,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1450485-buck,3,"It’s marvellous that something like Logicomix exists: a graphic novel that seeks to put the Vienna Circle on the pop-culture map deserves a special Pulitzer for chutzpah (read those last three words aloud and you’d swear you were speaking Hochdeutsch). But I sensed an uncomfortable tension here between the genuine profundity of the ideas being explored and the inescapably hammy conventions of comic-book narrative. No doubt there’s a special, tiny place in my heart for hamminess, just as there’s a miniature compartment in my brain for profundity, but mash them up and my uncomplicated soul gets all squirmy. Which, incidentally, explains why Billy Corgan's poetry has never brought me the spiritual sustenance it obviously has to millions of others.Although it’s only a small part of the story told in Logicomix, I’m fascinated by the unlikely bromance between Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. This is sort of unconscionable, but for the sake of brevity I’m going to translate their relationship into buddy-comedy terms: basically, Russell played the skirt-chasing Seth Rogen character to Wittgenstein’s high-strung, undersexed Paul Rudd. Of course, their differences ran a lot deeper than that. During the First World War, Russell’s pacifism landed him in prison, while Wittgenstein took the opposite route, volunteering for active duty on the eastern front and ending up a war hero (yes, brainy, unstable, rich-boy Wittgenstein. War hero. I shit you not. And in justifying his decision to enlist, he’d said that, before becoming a great philosopher, “he should become a human being.” Hard not to love the guy for that.) I couldn’t philosophize my way out of a paper bag, but as I understand it (partially thanks to Logicomix), Russell and Wittgenstein didn’t exactly see eye to eye on the great metaphysical issues of the day, either. If this means anything to you, Russell was a straight-edge foundationalist, whereas Wittgenstein was a total, punk-rock anti-foundationalist. So what happened is, Bertie spent a good decade of his career building this lovely epistemological sand castle, and then one day his buddy Ludwig comes along and nonchalantly kicks the shit out of it. And so Russell was like, “Dude.” But no harm done. Russell got over it and maybe even secretly admired Wittgenstein all the more for it.The lesson here is: don’t be friends with someone who’s much smarter than you unless you’re big-hearted enough to accept it. It’s a lesson I refuse to learn, but maybe you can profit from the example. "

Unfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoan, who gives us this assurance.’ —Bertrand Russell‘Logic! Good gracious! What rubbish! How can I tell what I think till I see what I say?’ —EM ForsterLogicomix has the admirable idea of presenting us, in comic form, with the story of the search for the logical underpinnings of mathematics in the early twentieth century, told mostly through the life of Bertrand Russell.Usually, when this story comes up at all, it seems to be told by way of a prelude to the birth of computing (in, for instance, Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, which rushes past Russell to get to Turing), so it was nice here to see it placed front and centre. And on the whole, the details of these often quite abstruse theoretical investigations are very well explained here, embedded as they are in the context of the main players' personal lives and professional rivalries.The set of all sets that do not contain themselves: Russell suddenly realises ""Russell's paradox""I really love Bertrand Russell for the way that his professional logicalism did not impede his towering moral authority – he embodied a pacifistic, anti-authoritarian activism that was awakened during the First World War and that lasted until the end of his life, when he was still being dragged away from protests by police in his eighties. This moral sensibility takes a backseat to the quest for logic in the book, though it's definitely there – a framing story concerns Russell's feelings about pacifism in the 1939 war, and within the main story the authors are careful to show the effects of the first war on all the major characters.Wittgenstein has an existential epiphany in the trenchesI have to admit, with my ideal image of Russell in mind, it was painful for me to read about the way he behaved towards his first wife and his children, about which I knew nothing before I read this. The authors – as they themselves explain – are very concerned to make sure that this is a story about these mathematicians' and philosophers' private lives as well as their professional investigations. Though I have to admit, the drama in the forbidden relationships and family secrets never seemed quite as engaging to me as the actual nerdy stuff about logic.Gödel drops the bombshell of his incompleteness theoremI had lingering doubts as I read this of whether it was really suited to the comics form: somehow, it never really felt like it was playing to the strengths of the medium. I was also not convinced by the choice to include several metanarrational interludes in which the authors and illustrators talk about how best to tell the story; this seemed, on the whole, more of a distraction than anything else, although a final section set during a present-day production of the Oresteia is a tour-de-force.The comic's authors walk around AthensThere's lots to get out of this book and I'd definitely recommend it, but in the end it's one of those pieces that I admired more for its concept than its execution. Illogical perhaps – but that, as the book demonstrates, is to be expected."
3,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31002-keith,1,"EDIT, APRIL 2020: The original vitriolic review I wrote here used to get the occasional vitriolic response, and each time I read the review thereafter, it made me a little more uncomfortable. Not because I disagreed with the basic sentiment: I originally set out to say that I thought this book was pretentious, and that it used the comics medium rather cynically in order to market itself, without really demonstrating much understanding of what makes the medium really interesting and useful for storytelling. I didn't actually write any of those things -- it was mostly just a series of cartoonishly over-the-top insults (and, somehow, it also included the phrase ""ninja dinosaur boobs""). But 'pretentious and cynical' is totally what I meant.The original review was written in 2009, when it seemed funny to me to sort of just yell at the internet and walk away without apologizing. For a variety of obvious reasons, I don't feel like I have the right to do that sort of thing anymore.Over the years, I have had readers of the original review tell me I have the intelligence of an adolescent, that they are going to burn my house down, and that I should kill myself. This also used to seem kind of funny to me, because it seemed like an isolated set of responses and behaviors. Now it's 2020, and this is mostly just how we communicate with each other online, period. Again, I don't think I like that sort of thing anymore.I do still feel like Logicomix was a cynical cash-grab attempting to capitalize on the boom of literati-approved graphic novels about ten years ago. At the time, I was very concerned about a trend I saw toward fairly uncritical reading practices on my Goodreads feed -- that if NPR or McSweeney's said a thing was good, then By God it Must Have Been. A lot of my anger toward this book was about that too.Again, I'm not sure I really care anymore why people read comics, or why they read at all. I still sort of roll my eyes when people read crap books, or take Instagram pictures every time they read as if they deserve an award. But it feels more important that I just shut up and let people like what they like, and do what makes them happy. Being happy about anything these days without judgment or guilt seems like an endeavor unto itself. But I still have trouble thinking about NPR without thinking about that Portlandia episode where they make fun of ""This American Life,"" and I take some small joy in barely being able to remember when Logicomix was considered an important book. ""I was right!"" I could scream uselessly into the Internet.And the Internet would look back and me, and slowly blink, and say, ""So?"""

Their integrity requires ruefully accepting it time and again when the newest genius tears down the fortress of truth each thought he had built. The constant questioning of principles and fervent desire to locate truth has been associated with ""madness', and that comes up in this, too. The drawing is engaging and witty. The story concludes, satisfyingly in an unexpected way, with a performance of the Orestia. Kudos to the author for coming up with such a well-executed and thought-expanding book."
5,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"I have a question for you. It's a simple-sounding question, but hard to answer, so I really want you to put a good amount of thought into it before you do. Okay? Yes, I'm still in Teacher-mode, but that's not important right now. My question is this:What is truth?It's one of those unanswerable questions that has bugged us ever since we started being able to ask unanswerable questions. Along with ""Why is there evil in the world?"" and ""Do we have free will or are our lives pre-determined from the beginning?"" or ""What's the deal with that Justin Bieber kid? I mean really?"" this question is one that people either ignore or obsess over.Didn't think I could do a pop-culture reference like that, did you? Shows how much you know....This graphic novel is about one man's pursuit of this question, and the ways in which it nearly destroyed his life. The man was Bertrand Russell, and we follow his life from his childhood to late adulthood as he searches for an unshakable foundation to mathematics and logic, and thus an absolute truth that he could rely on.As a child, Russell lived with the question of why things are the way they are, and got no good answers from his domineering grandmother. It wasn't until his introduction to geometry and the wonder of mathematical proofs that he could finally say there was something about which he could be absolutely sure in the universe. Mathematics, he thought, would be the answer to everything. Pure, unsullied and utterly, utterly reliable.But there was a flaw in math - the Axioms. Mathematics in the 19th century was a direct descendant of Euclid's work, and rested on a series of axioms in order to function. An axiom, then, is something that is assumed to be true so that you can go on to prove other things. For example, if you have a line, and a point not on that line, there can be only one line drawn through that point that is parallel to the first. Why is this true? Well... it just is. If you have to prove that, then you have to prove a thousand other things first, and you never end up being able to prove the thing you were trying to prove in the first place. It was like, he thought, the cosmological model of the world on the back of a turtle. Which stood on another turtle. Which stood on another, and another - turtles, all the way down.That didn't satisfy young Russell, and he went off in search of the floor upon which the last turtle stood, as it were - new mathematics that would be able to define the foundations of math, and thereby give a concrete understanding of the universe. Along the way, his desire to apply the certainty of math to human thought and interaction led him to the discipline of logic, a strange chimera of mathematics and philosophy. By becoming a logician, he thought he might finally be able to pin down some absolute truths about not only abstract math but human nature itself.Of course, he failed. Spectacularly. Broken marriages, broken friendships, ill health - his obsession with an absolute truth to the universe nearly destroyed everything he had. Fortunately for him, Russell pulled back from the abyss before it could swallow him whole, and became one of the early 20th century's greatest philosophers in the process. His failure to find an ultimate foundation for logic and math was not entirely without fruit - thanks to work by Russell and others, these disciplines were pushed forward in ways that made our modern lives possible. New ways of understanding the universe, from the unfathomable depths of infinity to the simplicity of 1+1=2, everything was open to examination in those days. Because of men like Bertrand Russell, humanity advanced in great leaps and bounds.In the end, it's a compelling book. I read and re-read it, convinced each time that there was something else I had missed. I was very often right. Doxiadis and Papadimitriou have put together a compelling tale of a man often overlooked by the general public, and they did so in a medium that's close to my heart - the graphic novel. The art, done by Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna, is wonderful. It has a simplicity that belies the complexity of its topic, and shows an excellent sense of storytelling. Hats off to the two of them, without a doubt.This book, it should be noted, is not a primer on logic. If you're looking to know how logic works, or you want to know a bit more about higher mathematics and how to do them, then you'd best look for another book. As the authors tell us right in the beginning, this book is a story, a great tragedy that owes its inspiration to the ancient productions of the Greeks. It's the story of a man who pitted himself against the universe and lost, but who did so in such a way that he - and the world - came out better for it. The book ends with a scene from The Oresteia, a classic Greek drama about another man who found himself in a no-win situation with no absolutes to rest upon. Much like Orestes, when faced with two choices that could lead to his destruction, the only way forward for Russell was to compromise and to move forward. By doing so, he not only became a happier man, but became involved with humanity again, as a philosopher, a teacher, and an anti-war activist.In the end, this book is about the compromises we all have to make as human beings. The world may be a logical place, but we are not. There is a limit to our logical understanding of ourselves, and sooner or later we have to accept that and deal with people as people, rather than as problems to be solved and equations to be balanced. Bertrand Russell's quest, as interpreted by this novel, is an example of how far we can push the need to know exactly that's at the bottom of it all. The fact that the foundations of our world appear to be unprovable and unknowable is, ultimately, unimportant. What is important is that we are here, now, and we need to make sense of our own lives."
6,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"Logicomix An Epic Search for Truth, came as a complete surprise to me. Given to me by a good friend for Christmas, this graphic novel first struck me as a psychodrama about an obsessive-compulsive personality, not at all resembling myself. But when I started to read it I realized that it was a history of early 20th century philosophy and foundations of mathematics, featuring cartoon characterizations of people I have studied at some length, such as Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gottlob Frege, Kurt Godel, Alan Turing and a dozen others. The first two of these are arguably the greatest philosophers of the 20th century.The only exposure I had had to graphic novels was through my daughter, who is an illustrator and has done her own comix. I had from time to time leafed through her collection, and we had seen Persepolis. But to see the form stretched around a subject about which I had been very serious was astonishing to me. The story functioned on so many levels that it was dizzying.On the highest, theoretical level the story was about the philosophical task of establishing mathematics on a firm logical foundation, so that it would become an ironclad vehicle for the pursuit of knowledge. This effort proved to have theoretical difficulties, which in turn led to the “anti-foundational” (pragmatic, relativistic) trend of philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. This intellectual history was portrayed by the activities of cartoon figures in dramatic situations. I had to strain to consider if they were getting it right, but I think they did a creditable job.The second level, the psychological interplay of (cartoon) personalities, was even better. Although dramatic action was obviously condensed, there was a very gossipy portrayal of the lives and foibles of the great philosophers and mathematicians. Cartoons lend themselves to melodrama, and the philosophers themselves had more than enough melodrama in their lives.On a third level of art, the cartoon artistry was beautiful. There were portrayals of very dramatic scenes and locations, such as a walk around the Parthenon in Athens, or the battlefields of war torn Europe, or the life of the British aristocracy, or laid-back Berkeley, California. The book ended with a climactic scene from the Oresteia Trilogy of Aeschylus, which was imposing and appropriate. As I write this I wonder how I can be talking about cartoons as though they were panoramic epics, but it worked.There were other levels as well, including connections to music, literature, languages, poetry, politics, history, and lots of other things. But at heart, the book was a great adventure of ideas, which I bought into completely. I think there is something fundamentally philosophical about portraying life with well-defined lines and shapes of uniform color. Everything is simplified and dramatized and so… graphic. It made me want to write the graphic novel of my life, or better yet, to live it."
7,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784534-stokespower,2,"kind of disappointing; don't think it set out to do what it aims to do (and what it aims to do is frequently stated) in bringing the story of the search for rigourous logic to life thorugh the lives of the main protagnist(s). essentially its a potted biography of bertrand russell, but so shortened as to be fairly meaningless. it's covering and explanation of logical theories is equally skimpy and vague.there's some neat comic tricks (asides to the reader, references to 'filming live'), a framing device of the comic creators discussing the comic's direction (which takes on more relevance in the context of russell's paradox) and a story within the story of one of the comic creators rehearsing a production of Oresteia, but ultimately it all falls short.whats really annoying is the great reviews printed on the back cover. i think any comic that isn't superheroes automatically gets credit as being intelligent and genre breaking. its not.and it cost me 25quid. thats the danger in buying comics..."

As explained in the back of the book, this is not, strictly speaking, a biography. It is a novel, largely based on facts. Some of the meetings never took place in person, but all of the meetings are based, at the very least, on interactions through correspondence.The book is highly readable, and enjoyable. It features interesting interactions between the authors and illustrators of the book, intermixed with the biography of the book's protagonist, Bertrand Russell. Very well done!"

It's interesting in many ways: its choice of topic, presentation & narrative style.Even the introduction & bibliography comes with graphics :DIt depicts different phases of life of Bertrand Russell who has been a mathematician, logician, philosopher, political activist & Noble laureate. The book has tried to be a simple, interesting guide to Russell's complex, laborious & frustrating conquest to pin down the foundations of mathematics. Though there's an open ending, I hope Doxiadis will soon come up with an interesting epilogue."

It also has the very interesting breaking the 4th wall kind of narration where some of the characters are aware of us, the readers and talk to us!The authors use their artistic license liberally to convey the biography of 'Bertie' Russell, by keeping the story line very captivating. Definitely a very good read for those who are interested in logic, theoretical computer science, mathematics or just pure philosophy."
11,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/160319-seth-t,4,"When age-spanning epics are called for, there are few so often drawn from the Great Well of Story Archetypes as the battle between order and chaos. In the realms of the human and the personal, some variation of Boy Meets Girl is undoubtedly the go-to narrative frame. But when a teller really wants to up the stakes and sell his audience either a cosmology or an apocalypse, only gods and monsters will do. And such a pairing (almost until the postmoderns) demands Order in one corner, girded and ready, honed to perfection and waiting with grim determination to show ropes to Chaos, who spills out over the opposite corner, spoiling for blood and violence and the reckless anarchy of the brawl. It's the story of Yahweh and Lucifer, of Marduk and Tiamat, of Feanor and Melkor, of Gandalf and Sauron. And it's the story of Bertrand Russell as romantically couched by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou.I haven't read a lot of Bertram Russell. Apart from a couple scattered essays, breezed through nearly twenty years ago, my acquaintance with the man's work is nearly without existence. And those writings I have spent time with have been rather facile, wholly practical works—neither of which included any expression of maths at all. Honestly, while I knew of Russell's status as a logician, I was unaware of what exactly that meant and exactly how foundational was Russell's place in the logical pantheon. (And this after taking several semesters of logic in college. We studied the application of logic rather than the history of the stuff and I didn't study enough of it to get beyond base symbolics, which I rather enjoyed.) It seems that I missed out on a lot. Logicomix is the story of what is apparently Russell's masterwork, 
Principia Mathematica
, in which Russell seeks to ground mathematics in logic rather than in mere axiom. More though, as Logicomix unfolds, we see that the formation of the Principia is really Russell's struggle to impose Order on a world that seems to be built on Chaos. Doxiadis and Papadimitriou work hard to sell the concept, even to the point of overlaying the 
Oresteia
 as an interpretive framework. Will order govern chaos? Will logic come to supplant madness?The authors keep us excited and invested in the tale's outcome. We see the stakes clearly spelled out by Russell even at an early age as he wrestles with the arbitrariness of the world as described to him by his religious aunt. We see his conundrum as his excitement over the promise of mathematics collapses entirely when he realizes his supposed salvation is built upon what amounts to wishful thinking. We see his hopes laid bare as he looks to logic for a foundation for mathematics—and so a foundation for belief in an ordered universe. We see the detritus of a history of logicians whose minds broke against the fortressed walls of infinity and paradox. Will Russell succumb? Will he find the elixir to banish paradox? Will he in his alchemical balance of math and philosophy—in his inundation into the fountain of logic—find salvation? Will we? Or will he only find one more succubus, a myth that will drain him of life and reason, leaving him as much a wreck as his predecessors?Doxiadis and Papadimitriou excel at putting forth Russell's dilemma in terms easily understandable. We feel Russell's pain as he and his partner, Whitehead, struggle for years to find their solution. We wait with the rest of the early 20th century's logical community for a solution to Russell's paradox, what amounted to a devastating blow to the superstructure of logic itself. We understand why Russell teeters on the brink of madness, even as his forerunners Cantor and Frege succumb. Unfortunately, and perhaps this is testimony to its complexity, the authors only offer the most brushing glance at Russell and Whitehead's solution (and of Kurt Gödel's extrapolation). We see that it's there, that Russell has done... something. Only we aren't told what exactly.Personally, I would have liked a page or two more on this tack. Even if a simplified explanation still sat over my head, at least I'd be able to pick at it, circle in on it, and take it apart at my leisure. As is, if I'm inclined to discover what Russell ended up doing, I'm forced to find that out on my own.Still, as the creators attest in one of their self-referential fourth-wall-sundering interludes, their primary concern in this saga is the persons rather than the ideas. While the ideas belong to the characters and help shape their figures in our imaginations, people who are well-sketched are people built of emotions and histories and romance and goals and anguish. They are made of their circumstances and their ideas are made of them. Logicomix fights foremost to tell the story of people as people. And here it succeeds unflinchingly.Every one of its figures are persons with their own lives and histories, all of which I am interested to discover. Should the creative team here devote pages to any one of the mathematicians, philosophers, or logicians that wander across Russell's life as presented here, I will purchase and read such a book. Wittgenstein in particular marks a character who I'd love to see pursued in his own book—even though Wittgenstein inhabits a fair percentage of Russell's book, I was thirsty for more.[Oh Wittgenstein, could I ever not love you?]Logicomix as biography is somewhat lacking, in that it tails off a good thirty years before Russell's death and leaves the story of the Principia's final impact upon logic merely hinted at. But as a story of Russell's search for order against the winds of chaos, I found the book a compelling excursion. The book is subtitled An Epic Search for Truth and, while the howling of Madness still sits spectre behind Russell's quest for a foundation in Logic, at the least Logicomix delivers a worthwhile yarn pretty near on a level with Marduk's duke-out with Tiamat.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]"
12,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,4,"Logicomix is an impressive (graphic) novel, as much in scope as visually and structurally, and as a reader with some background in mathematics and philosophy, I'm very glad that at least this kind of fiction is written. After some contemplation, I also came to agree that its subtitle, 'An Epic Search Truth', wasn't disappointed either. I fluctuated between the present one star short rating and the full during the course of my read, mulling over this point a fair bit and this is what I hope to remark on here.This is a fictionalised biographical account of Bertrand Russell with a backdrop of escalating war on the one hand, and a story about telling a story on the other (self-referential, if you will- reflecting the central paradoxes of Russell's and the 20th century academic establishment's quest for a solid basis on which to operate). The choice of Russell struck me as somehow both inspired and obvious- in succession let's say, to avoid paradox. Through Russell, himself a dominating figure in philosophy and logic during its most productive period, we encounter the giants on whose shoulders our certainties, and more significantly uncertainties, today rest. These are odd, eccentric sorts we meet, and the narrative doesn't shy from the the frank suggestion that insanity and logic are intertwined in some way. The problem is that many of the depictions are exaggerated (it recalled to me E T Bell's Men of Mathematics) to keep the plot focused and pertinent. However, the meta-fiction aspect came to the rescue here, and through the account of a disagreement between the book's author and consultant, this claim doesn't go entirely unchallenged even if it affects the tone of the work. The truly frightening quality of insanity isn't the possibility that some germ of it is within you, as Russell is made to mull over, but that it's a continuous spectrum which reaches sanity through ambiguous mists. The problem is often about settling on what's enough to label someone mad rather than a distinct insane vs sane divide. Logicomix provides no discussion on this, but it offers a metaphor, following a confused journey through modern Athens in search of a rehearsal, that reality is mapped in men's minds and madness is when it's confused with its impression. This segues nicely into Wittgenstein's solution in the main storyline.The characters feel very real in that the reader's interest is sustained while their sympathies are made to vary, but they only broadly align with their historical selves. Certain details are preserved and recalled well where these are relevant, but the strength of Logicomix is that the finer points of logic interweave but never interrupt the drama of human failings and personal tragedy and the glimmer through all of it, of hope (for Russell, the quest is as much for this balance as for the truth that might liberate him from his foundational anxieties). As such when it comes to their field of study (which it often does!), characters tend to become mouthpieces for entire traditions of thought, some they founded, some they were the most famous part of, and thus exaggerated. This is a good way, combined with some of the other narrative techniques which allow for clarifications (like pausing for the questions and reflections at the studio and having the authors and staff voice the likely thoughts going through the reader's mind), to broadly do the concepts mentioned some justice, but it inflicts too much of the personal from time to time, if with the good intention of showing to the layman how some people can be so excited about such a seemingly dry subject (look at how the delegates from the International Congress of Mathematics at the turn of the century where Hilbert presented his famous problems come to embody collective reactions or the way Wittgenstein is shown to be 'intense' to the point of zeal).More serious is the problem that many of these personalities are put together a little incongruously, and compared to Russell lack context for some of their thought and ways, that the logic from madness or madness from logic theme theme might be unconsciously invoked without it being warranted.There is a note justifying some of the historical inventions and distortions at the end of the book which reasserts some of the historical, dare we say, artifice, and a detailed glossary and a bibliography follow, so to some extent this allowance is mitigated.The art (a fresh, somehow very European style) and lettering (for an admirably clean, clear English suited to a book touching on logic, which nevertheless evokes Russell's period from time to time) reinforce the twofold nature of the ambitions chronicled, in that they strive for progress at great cost but also seem circular, and the nested stories are very smoothly brought back in line after digressions. I especially enjoyed the recurring and illuminating scenes from Aeschylus's Oresteia by way of the aforementioned drama rehearsal and how Wittgenstein's experiences in the war were portrayed.A fantastic read in all, remarkable for its dexterity and character portraits (or at times suppositions, rather) as it shifts back and forth through a live history surrounding the 'foundational quest'. It's not a graphic-boosted textbook on logic or even particularly serious about logic at all, but an observation on the human condition through the frustrated efforts of some of mankind's greatest thinkers at establishing truth in the hopes of being free once and for all of continually shifting ground underfoot.I thought I'd add this blog post and its follow-up."

The story within the story is of an old Bertrand Russell going to give a lecture just days after Germany invaded Poland and the protestors surrounding the lecture hall demand he support the call for pacifism, to keep Britain out of the war. Russell invites them in and begins the lecture - of his life, of Logic, and his answer to their calls. It helps to have the two narrating voices - Russell in 1939 looking back on his life and the creative team putting all of this together in the '00s, as we get two interpretations of events to give a balanced view to the reader. I won't go into all the detail of Russell's life but it is interesting. I also won't go into the maths/philosophy side of the book - mostly because I've forgotten it! The book does a very good job of explaining the philosophies of the thinkers in the book. Russell, Frege, Godel, even Wittgenstein are accessible and understandable in the writers' hands. The fact that, 2 days later, I've forgotten them just shows that I've no strong grasp of Logic theory and is no bad reflection on the book. No matter - as the creators themselves acknowledge, every pain was taken to make this a graphic novel and by no means a maths/science/philosophy book. The narrative is more important than any lengthy explanations of the theories or the lives depicted within and so the story is the centre of the book which is why it's so much fun to read. Despite the lofty ideas you never find yourself intimidated and the pages fly by enjoyably. The book also talks about how many logicians became mad. Christos, the consultant on the book, has a map in his mind of the area he grew up in but 30 years have passed when he visits it again and gets lost amid the changed landscape. He uses this to come up with a great line on insanity: ""Sure, Frege, Russell, Whitehead were excellent map-makers but maybe eventually they confused their reality with their maps."" (p.217). A separate note should be made of the artwork. The team of Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna have created a story that is beautiful to look at. Their artwork reminded me of the other brilliant comics team of Phillippe Dupuy and Charles Berberian whose ""Monsieur Jean"" stories are gorgeous to see (though the subject matter is much more lightweight). The artwork really brought the book to life juxtaposing the academic material with swirling images and colourful landscapes. The scenes of Wittgenstein in WW1 were extraordinary as the reader was invited to see Wittgenstein's breakthrough in his work pulled back with a vast view of the nightmarish trenches and mortar fire with him in the midst of it. Really amazing work throughout. It's an extraordinary comic and a brilliant piece of work. "

Just serendipitously tripped on reading about Wittgenstein and also saw a few videos on Deconstruction/PostStructuralism. Initially I found these big sounding words difficult to absorb but kept with them and became bit addicted in the flow. And finally landed on logic ( Tractatus by Wittgenstein).This graphic novel was a welcome change and provided some great clarity on Russell's contribution. I consider myself a novice just enjoying how their thoughts progressed. Being a student of economics I liken this to History of Economic Thought.Bertrand Russell was a mentor to Wittgenstein and this novel provided some great context. I recommend this to anyone wanting to get a taste of logic, philosophy and math. Enjoyed Russell's storybook life."
16,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"Logicomix was good. But it wasn't exceptional.The drama of logic and mathematics, in my opinion, is portrayed much better in Doxiadis's other novel, Uncle Petros. I liked how the decision to make it a graphic novel worked for this story, but to be honest I got lost on my way, trying to understand Bertrand's thoughts and his interaction with other mathematicians and/or logicians of variable mental soundness, including himself. By the end, it all seemed so trivial, as if no real answer could come out of it all, as if these guys were trapped on a moebius strip trying to find their way to the other side. Is my losing my way of the story indicative of how complex these matters really are, that there is 'no escape'? Can't say, I'm afraid...High points: Wittgenstein, the lecture-in-an-American-university narrative device, the art style.Low points: I was not terribly interested in the creators appearing as characters in Logicomix. It seemed arbitrary and somehow unseemingly pretentious. I can see what they were trying to do, but I cannot decide whether it was poorly implemented or if it is just impossible to incorporate such a subplot without having it interfere with the main story.I used to own this book but I lent my copy to my ex. I suppose I'll never see it again: an unfortunate casualty of war... I hope she enjoys it at least, I recall she never finished it."
17,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,3,"In a world where no other books competed for your valuable reading time (a finite resource), I'd have no hesitation in giving this book five stars. It's fun to read, executed with charm and flair (some might say chutzpah, and one has to admire the authors' sheer nerve in dreaming it up. Hell, you'll even learn a thing or two. A selective biography of Russell (with a few minor alterations), with cameo appearances by the various mathematical and philosophical luminaries who worked on the logical foundations of mathematics early in the last century. These were some tormented individuals; several became unhinged in later life (Frobe, Cantor, Godel), others struggled with a family history of mental imbalance (Russell, Hilbert). So the story is not dull. The authors' effort to explain the issues involved is a valiant one, but cannot avoid falling victim to the intrinsic limitations of the form. In the end, the most the reader can hope to take away from a graphic novel like this is a cartoon understanding of what all the fuss was about. Judged on its own terms, the book is a success - it's entertaining and well executed. The inherent limitations prevent me from giving it more than three stars, however. Anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the fundamental issues raised in the book will need to look for answers further afield. "
18,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4231205-christoph,2,"This book, I think, is a good example of how self-references ruin something that is otherwise really awesome. Every cool thing that the book tries to do is pointed out in the ""meta"" modern-day sections with the creators discussing the work. It leaves no room for the reader to interpret the themes and motifs for themselves. I think the bits with the creators are good to give the larger work some context, but that is all. Every time the authors do something interesting, they also jump up and down as i to say ""did you see that? How cool was that?""The truth is, the modern-day bits with the creators could have been completely eliminated, in my opinion. I did enjoy the inter-textuality at the end with the play they were going to see, but again, they ruined it by talking about how much their story is like the play, leaving no room for the reader to understand that for themselves. Without the bits with the creators, I would have given this book 5 stars and it would gladly recommend it to my friends, but with them, this aspiring work reads like it was created for 13 year-olds. I guess that's who the creators think read graphic novels."
19,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,5,Soooo good. A very fun graphic novel about people and their maddening quest for foundational mathematics and objective truth. The novel does a great job at faithfully portraying and expressing the obsession for solving these fundamental problems that consumes great minds. And no wonder-- it is written by mathematicians!
20,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5525318-victor-finn,4,"I was so surprised by how greatly I enjoyed this graphic novel about analytic philosopher Bertrand Russel's epic quest to discover the foundations of mathematics. It goes to show the extent to which graphic novels are still an untapped medium for story-telling in the west. The characterization in this book is just so damn good. It is hard not to like such characters as Whitehead, Wittgenstein and of course Russel from the moment they appear on the page. I love who the author argues that the ideas that these people have in their lives are not too separate from those very lives themselves, a sentiment Nietzsche shared as well.The portrait painted of Bertrand is a very fascinating one. From a troubled and lonely childhood, he takes great comfort in the stable power of rationality after he discovers it from a math tutor. When at university he discovers how shaky the foundations of mathematics really are, he is filled with existential anxiety and sets off on an intense intellectual struggle to prove that the foundations of reality itself are rationally explainable. His quest costs him his loved ones and his own sanity at times. Bertrand's big character flaw is that he becomes so committed to a particular map of the territory of real life that he forgets to look at the territory at all, causing him to ruin his family in the name of ideals that he is stubbornly committed to. The connections to Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy, which I was not expecting, are also fantastic and very smart. I'll save the spoilers on what that connection is exactly, but suffice to say it is good. The only problem I had with this book is that, even though it is good, it still has untapped potential. Why not use the graphic novel medium to attempt to visually depict some of the abstract arguments that the characters argue for in the book? I also found the themes of the book to very ham-fisted at times, which detracted from their profundity. I hope this wasn't because the author doubts the intelligence of his audience. Just because someone likes graphic novels doesn't mean that they don't understand the finer points of philosophy and literature. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone at all who loves philosophy. Hopefully there all be more innovative graphic novels like this one in the future."
21,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,4,"I've always believed that looking for expecting a perfect solution inevitably leads to extremism - for me, integrists are simply people who have become too lost in theory. They're not monsters - they're just people with strongly held beliefs who have forgotten that, more often than not, one has to tolerate a certain degree of uncertainty, even compromise, in order to reach a valid conclusion. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing touch with reality.I went to a Catholic school until I was 18, so I know full well that arguing this point isn't exactly easy. It doesn't matter how reasonable and conciliatory it sounds in your head - people will accuse you of moral relativism, even cowardice. Well, apparently there was someone who made this point long before I did - Bertrand Russell, a philosopher and public figure known for his high moral integrity. Oh, and also, a logician. Take that, stupid teenage classmates!Interestingly enough, his story is told in a very metafictional way. I've always felt attracted to metafiction exactly because of this reason. By metafiction I mean experiments like Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile, in which the author subverts an original storyline and saves only the most essential plot points in order to play with parallelism. I get a kick out of it every single time, because it reminds me of how very little of what we take for granted is in fact essential - to a story, to a person, or to a way of life. There's something morally very powerful about that.Then there's the other sort of metafiction, in which the author breaks the fourth wall and draws attention to the fact that the book is, precisely, a book. I'm a big fan of that too, but in this case it definitely doesn't work. To begin with, there's too much of it - the authors keep interrupting the plot to explain what just happened and where they plan on going next. This doesn't enhance, subvert or question anything - it's just sloppy. It reads like they got overexcited and wanted to include much more than they thought the storyline could contain. ""See what we did there? We're drawing a parallel between The Oresteia and Russell's foundational quest! Get it?"". I understand that this is related to the self-referential theme, but it still feels like cheating. You don't use metafiction for cheating!Anyway, Russell's life story was fascinating, and it's made me want to read both Russell and The Oresteia, so I'm very happy I read it."

a new experience of ecstasy was the best antidote to any lurking residue of fear.

The story is very engaging, esp. the part which is in the voice of Bertrand Russel. The story touches on the struggles and the philosophy that drove and inspired Russel and many other contemporary ""thinkers"" of 20th century. I wish I had read this before I had studied Gödel in college; I would have paid a thousand times more attention and would have liked it a lot more. :P So, the book definitely did a brillliant job conveying the philosophy and origin stories of logic. However, it is a 4 star because I did *not* like the style of narration. The authors/creators are characters in the comic and that chime in every now and then to debate/put forward their view points. That broke the fluidity for me. At times, I would just eagerly wait for them to shut up so that I can hear Russel."
25,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38238221-aditya,4,Cool comic with the authors telling us about the authors telling us about Bertrand Russell telling about Bertrand Russell. This pseudo-biography is not a 100% historically accurate (the book explicitly points that out) and there are almost no math details included.The drawings are pleasing to the eye and the style is pretty similar to Herge's but with milder tones. There were a few anti-semitic and sexist remarks that irked me but I realized that they were introduced to make the characters closer to their real versions.The 'notebook' at the end with history trivia is worth going through.

I am really trying to write here something conclusive but I cannot. You don't find the ultimate truth but the journey that started long time ago and still continues."
27,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3531479-mza,3,"Math-wise, not especially revelatory to this reader -- someone who just barely passed high school calculus -- and it certainly wouldn't challenge a mathematician in that way, but maybe that's for the best. As a simplified biography of Bertrand Russell and a simplified history of the relationships between various schools of logical thought in the early 20th century, Logicomix maintains the mood of a lively conversation between well-adjusted nerds and the dinner dates they don't want to bore. Set Theory, Infinity, Self-Reference, and Incompleteness Theorem are all covered, but not in a way that risks disengagement from the story. For the lay reader, it's probably enough to know that two of the authors are mathematicians -- it'd be rude of them to ""show their work"".Even when Russell's explanations aren't especially helpful (On infinity: ""Imagine a hotel that always has an extra room, even when it's full.""), or possibly because they're unhelpful and therefore mysterious, his thirst for an absolutely solid logic is contagious. Logicomix's two writers and two artists succeed in giving a hopeless, neurotic quest the forward momentum of a whodunit. The book is at its best when mapping out Russell's desire to connect the promise of an orderly, abstract, perfect way of thinking to the perfecting of humankind in the so-called ""real"" world, life as lived. In this desire, he comes off as both an innocent and an advanced human.The tale is structured cleverly as a behind-the-curtain argument about how best to tell the tale. Russell's first-person account of his life is frequently interrupted by scenes of Logicomix's authors commenting upon their work-in-progress and wondering where and how to go next, as if what we are reading is a draft continuously in revision. Apostolos speaks directly to ""the camera"" while walking his dog. Christos worries that the book paints Russell as a failure. Alecos and Annie, the husband-and-wife cartooning team, play devil's advocate, standing in for the mathematically unschooled. As one of the recurring themes of Russell's life and work is Self-Reference, this self-referential approach seems appropriate.The cartoonists' ligne claire style is also thematically well-suited to Russell's search for clarity, though overall it is boring to look at. Ultimately, the lack of comix magick (a.k.a. poetry) prevents me from liking this more. What do you expect, though -- logic is right there in the title. If Kevin Huizenga ever decides to give Wittgenstein a similar treatment, put at least one person in The Set Of All People Who Immediately Cream Their Pants."
28,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"This book is extremely well done. Everything from the art to the binding to the glossary really gives the feeling that it's a labor of love, nothing is rushed, every detail is considered. The subject is Bertrand Russell and his idealistic (quixotic?) quest to find a way to use logic to irrefutably prove the foundations of mathematics, and by extension, all of reality. The book does a great job of linking him to his influencers, contemporaries and those who took and built on his work while keeping the story moving and entertaining.I'm not a big fan of Russell, his personality was thorny, he made some colossal intellectual and personal mistakes and ultimately his work on logic, while an important stepping stone, seems to have been almost entirely superseded by Gödel. That said, I'm no expert on the subject and I was heavily biased when Solzhenitsyn, who is one of my heroes and usually very generous in terms of character judgement, criticized Russell pretty brutally in The Gulag Archipelago. Despite all that, this book gave me more respect for Russell's unwavering commitment to finding truth and rationality. Read it. It'll take you 3 hours."

30,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46200817-val-dusek,5,"This is one of the most amazing books I have read. On rereading it I am even more impressed.To take the history of logic and turn it into an adventure story is an extraordinary achievement. The blurbs on the back are not exaggeration. I think the subplot about the authors should have been cut out. It interrupts the main plot in a distracting way. True, the book is fictionalized, but it is mostly a true narrative with a few embellishments. The opening is ingenious device. Russell is invited to a pacifist meeting and says he now supports war against Hitler. His followers are shocked and say he, a former pacifist, contradicts himself. He replies he used to worship logic, but now has less faith in it, and the story flashbacks to the beginning of Russell's life, leading to his dedication to mathematics and logic, but leading to Goedel showing that all of arithmetic cannot be deduced from a single, finite bunch of logical assumptions, and the dream is over.Along the way we meet the now insane Cantor, who developed infinite sets, his articles were rejected, he has nervous breakdowns, and by the time his work is appreciated had turned to things like proving Bacon wrote Shakespeare and that Jesus was an illegitimate son, not of Mary as well as writing to the Pope that Catholicism should use his infinite set theory to describe hierarchies of angels (which inspired Cantor's idea of infinities), and God. We meet Frege who made giant steps toward the goal, who wrote a 2 volume work of logic, but says says at the end it's all wrong. When Russell visits him he finds his admired precursor turns out to be a raving anti-Semite. Along the way we see Russell's student Wittgenstein, later founder of two successive schools of philosophy, who criticizes Russell's monumental work, then tests himself as a soldier, writes a short book that he thinks solves all issues of philosophy, and turns to (wildly unsuccessful school teaching in the boonies of Austria for a while (though this stimulates his latter return to philosophy). We meet the head of the logical positivist school, Schlick, who is murdered by a proto-Nazi who is religious opposed to the atheist Schlick and whose spouse is sleeping with Schlick. (Talk about overdetermined.) Toward the end we meet Goedel, attacked by Nazis as Jew, though he isn't, and who brings the whole temple of an absolutely certain and comprehensive logical foundation of mathematics down, and many more.After the exhausting work of the 3 volume ""Principia Mathematica,"" Russell experiences the pain of his collaborator, Whitehead's wife, whom Russell has come to love, and realizes human feeling and suffering is more important than logic. He than becomes an anti-war campaigner, the end of which we see at the opening of the bookI can't recommend this book highly enough. Read it, and I hope you eventually follow up with Monk's biographies of Wittgenstein and of Russell. Monk's first volume on the early, logical Russell is excellent, though in the second volume the conservative and prudish Monk downgrades Russell out of dislike of Russell's turbulent political and sex life."
31,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14615191-kartik-gulati,5,"Logicomix is interesting, it's self reflexivity a metaphor for the story it's trying to tell. It takes us through the lives and conversations of the authors OF the graphic novel while they attempt to write Logicomix (a book whose foundational narrative involves its own writing), through which they aim to write about the life of Bertrand Russell, a historic figure in mathematics and philosophy. Russell's main pursuit in life was to find the ultimate truth in mathematics. He based his pursuit on the knowledge that the foundations of mathematics, and therefore all sciences, were based on intuitively agreed-to, but not mathematically provable, axioms. He spent his entire life in identifying the ultimate foundational truth which could be conclusively provel through logic, on which all other logic could be based. This pursuit led him to the discovery of set theory which is briefly explored in the book as an anecdote to the foundation problem - the missing link between logic and reality. Of how ultimately at the foundations of logic, things become self referential. A= A because A=/ B (because B = B and B=/A). This is where the books format becomes interesting - logicomics refers to its own authors who refer back to logicomix to tell us the story of Russell's life. This is where the book, in my opinion, makes its central point - that tools like logic, emotion, spirituality are but tools to understand the world and no tool alone is sufficient. For instance, let us look at science as a version of google maps. It is highly efficient and precise in taking us from point A to B, in telling us distances, locations etc. But that 2-d representation of the world fails to capture its 3d beauty, its smells, the feeling of wind. (A kind of representation problem already explored in different areas of philosophy) Science is very much like google maps, it is accurate, but it is only 1 of the many maps to be used to understand reality. It alone does not capture everything, or atleast that possibility must be entertained. It is entirely possible that other tools - perhaps spirituality, psychedelics, etc. are good candidates to give us more data points on the world which science alone does not have the capacity to. This central learning about the world, that it is not only a permutation and combination of different logic(s), is key to understanding human behaviour and therefore in moulding the world accordingly. This map vs reality split was transformational in my own understanding of the world and I'm thankful for having run into this book, almost by chance. "

The first half of this comic book bored me because it dealt with the particular, Bertrand Russell and his life and his actions and what was happening to him. The book barely held my interest in the first half.The second half of the book hit its stride when it started dealing with ideas, the abstract and its relation to the concrete and concepts of the logical positivist and Wiggenstein and Godol. I’ll bet you there were thirty or so thought bubbles throughout the second half of the text that I could repeat after having read this book and for anyone who is not familiar with the logical positivists this book would be a great introduction. I was struck by something I didn’t realize until I read this book. ‘Infinite Jest’ grabs onto the paradoxes highlighted with the second half of this comic book. David Foster Wallace also appeals to Kierkegaard which the logical positivist definitely do not. Overall, there is enough substance to this book where I could recommend it to someone who is interested in the foundations of thought, mathematics, science and philosophy and has never cracked open the ‘Principia of Mathematics’ or has not read the ‘Tractatus’ or has not spent time treading Russell or has never read a book on the ‘Philosophy of Science’. So, I would say this comic book is a good place to start but is not a good place to end. I would be able to share this book with somebody, but only if I knew they weren't familiar with this kind of stuff, because there are clearly flaws within this book. "

I don't recommend this unless you know the topic. There are helpful notes at the end, but this isn't your everyday comic book biography.With that said, I still liked this and learned more about Bertrand Russell's philosophy and life. The art work was okay, reminded me of Tintin in some ways. The writing? Some of it came off to me. I felt like I had to know what they were talking about and at time it wasn't clear.If you are into logic and mathematical philosophy or want to know more about Russell, i'd recommend this, if not, you might get lost.NOTE: This is the fourth philosophy comic book I've read and it's not a bad comic book, but it's not the best or the most clear to the point."

There are also plenty of references to math and logic and philosophy. In what looks to be a play on the Russell paradox, this book is self-referential: it breaks frequently from the story of Russel to tell the story of how the book was written."

37,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,4,"Although I rarely cover graphic novels, this one is quite unique. Written and drawn by Greek artists and philosophers, Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth, is essentially a summary of the influences upon and experiences of Bertrand Russell. Russell, of course, was an anti-church logician (and the comic illustrates some of the early influences upon him that may have given rise to some of that hostility) and an advocate of open marriage (in spite of his unsuccessful attempts at the seduction of his colleague’s and older friend’s wife) who is most famous for his efforts in Principia Mathematica (written along with my favorite philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead). This look at the famous atheist demonstrates how mathematics provided a safety net for the famous philosopher during his early years—something solid and knowable, even in the midst of the strict rules and closed attitude of his grandmother.In terms of logic, Russell’s quest begins with the set theory of Georg Cantor. Unfortunately for Russell, his certitude is destroyed by his own paradox. In addition to the famous Greek philosopher who says all Cretans are liars and is himself a Cretan (So, he can’t be telling the truth that all Cretans are liars since he has just declared himself to be one and if he is, he isn’t telling the truth.) and the barber in the village that must shave himself even though barbers are supposed to be for shaving others, the graphic novel introduces a modern UC Berkeley professor named Christos H. Papadimitriou who asks if a catalog of all books which are not self-referential would have its own title in the catalog. If it did, it would be self-referential so it would not belong and if it did not, it wouldn’t be self-referential so it wouldn’t contain all of the books which are not self-referential. So, there came to be Russell’s paradox that the set of all sets cannot properly contain itself.Since Russell’s hero was a logician named Gottlob Frege who had founded his entire approach on set theory, his paradox undid all he longed to accomplish. Frege, by the way, went mad and became an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist while the other main contender of set theory, Georg Cantor, felt he had been rescued from the demonic aspects of his theory (he believed his logic would swallow the very concept of God) by Russell’s paradox. Meanwhile, the authors of this graphic novel point out the thin, permeable barrier between logicians and madness (even citing Russell’s personal journal, transliterated into Greek letters where he considered killing himself as a young man) via Frege’s conspiratorial bent, Cantor’s insanity, Godel starving himself to death via paranoia, and both Hilbert and Russell having psychotic sons. Perhaps, the real essence of this narrative can be found when Ludwig Wittgenstein complains about infinity “creeping into” mathematics and Russell asserts that it is already there in the conceptual universe. Then, Wittgenstein gets tremendously disturbed that Russell has (almost Platonically) assumed the independent existence of a mathematical reality.And here is the moral of the story for me. Russell’s Principia Mathematica paved the way for the work of Kurt Godel, Johann (“Johnny”) von Neumann, and Alan Turing, all of which advanced the way for the computing revolution. Yet, Russell’s desire was to find absolute certitude—something that is only possible in very limited circumstances. As a result, his quest for truth was doomed to frustration. It is impossible for humans to control all of the variables; therefore, absolute certitude is impossible. Does that mean reasoning is wasted? Absolutely not! Does it make empirical logic infallible? Absolutely not! This is a fascinating (and extremely light) overview of the thought of Russell and other very key thinkers who paved the way for our postmodern era. It’s a fascinating work and I highly recommend it, particularly to those who haven’t read these thinkers and want a quick “intro-level” survey in very entertaining form."
38,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957550-josh,4,"Alright. Okay. Let me know if this sounds like a good read: a graphic novel about logician Bertrand Russel’s quest for the foundation on mathematics, as told by him at a symposium wherein he is supposed to comment on America’s possible involvement in World War II, as told by the people who created this book, who are actually characters in the book and discussing the creation of the book. Sounds like a dud right? Wrong. The only dud this book is capable of being is ‘Dud’ley Do-Right.While the framing of the story is unconventional, and the subject matter not what you would think of as engrossing, Logicomix actually serves up quite an entertaining read, especially for the mathematically or philosophically inclined reader. The concepts of mathematics the books touches on have the potential to be very complicated, but the way they are presented make them really easy to understand. The best teachers can explain even the most complicated topics in simple terms, and the folks who penned this book do quite a fine job of that.As I mentioned earlier, the book contains a few parallel narratives, with Bertrand Russel’s speech/ memoir driving the bulk of the tale and the metatextual creator commentary only popping in wherever a little extra clarification is necessary.One of the more interesting themes discussed in the book is the association of those whose search for answers sends them to the loony bin. The authors suggest that there is a correlation between logic and madness, though they leave it to the reader to sort out. I for one can understand how one might lead to the other, as sometimes late at night when I’m looking up at the moon, I can feel the urge to rip that mocking satellite out of the sky and stick it into the microwave and nuke-blast that thing for 20 minutes on high. So, clearly I’ve got the logic thing down pat, and now I’m worried about going mad.The people attending Russel’s lecture are a group of ardent pacifists who think that America should stay out of the war at all costs. They wait patiently for the academic giant to affirm their thoughts, only to have him finish his speech being neither for nor against the war. Instead, he argues that if the foundations of mathematics can not be found, then none of the world’s difficult questions can come with hard and fast, ‘ready made’ answers. He basically says that if you want to know what to do, then you really have to think about it. Really think, not just go along with the flow, but make up your own damn mind.I found the message really enlightening, especially in the current political climate where most people fall nicely into their ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ categories. It’s very, very clear that neither side is completely right and the other completely wrong. Instead, perhaps we should all take our cue from ol’ Bertie Russel and think for ourselves every once in a while.Just kidding. Keep reading my blog and aligning your vision of the world with mine. Thank you!"

40,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,4,"This is a graphic novel about Bertrand Russell -- noted mathematician, logician, pacifist, and horndog -- and his search for a solid foundation of logic, only to be met with frustration and paradox. The interesting part, as the different layers of this self-referential comic go to great pains to show, Russell is driven in his quest for absolute certainty by passion and a fear of insanity. And it doesn't hurt that the early twentieth century ladies go for logicians.The structure is a little contrived. The main thread is a lecture by an older and wiser Russell as England is on the brink of WWII, who tells stories of his life in flashback. Then it cuts away to the writers and their office in Athens as they discuss the themes with all the subtlety of the exposition on a TV cop show. But that's as bad as it sounds because it fits in with the artificial world of logic and it's probably the best way to explain some of the paradoxes without resorting to technical notation.The young Russell is not too sympathetic of a character as he sends his wife off to an institution and hits on his co-author's wife under his own roof. But we get the idea that he mellowed out with age and gave up on the whole certainty thing as the century progressed.[[[Aside: What would be more awesome than being a young scientist in the first decade of the 20th century as relativity, quantum theory, and the structure of the atom were all being understood? Unfortunately, things get pretty horrible pretty quickly as the century goes on.]]]One weird thing about this book is that John von Neumann (my favorite mathematician, by the way) is portrayed as sort of a chatty Cathy. Everything I've read about him indicates that this was definitely not the case."

Specifically, I found this enjoyable and not just ""good"" because most ""good"" books on logic and mathematics would nevertheless have me so mentally strained I'd be thrashing about like a seal in a bath (I may have stolen this phrase from Caitlin Moran). I barely even noticed I was learning! Maybe I'll even read one of the seminary books cited in this. I'll leave it to you to decide on the likeliness of this happening given that I've just started watching Orange is the New Black on Netflix.I second Terry's annoyance about the meta-ness which I think worked an awful lot better in Maus than it did here, where it is much more transparent as an expositional device. It was irritating in the same way that voiceovers are on TV. I'd much rather writers trusted their characters to communicate what they want to say. It's totally fascinating to me, given the dedication of these men to order and reason, that their personal lives were often an absolute mess and mental illness and suicide absolutely rife among both them and their families. You have to wonder whether it's cause or effect--whether they were trying to impose order on their own ""irrational"" minds or whether their obsession with these convoluted and artificial thought processes exacerbated their mental states. Either way, it was much easier to empathise with their wives than it was with them. Thanks to Terry for the lend!"
42,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33887-imogen,4,"Man, remember when comic books and, by extension, graphic novels had a reputation for being dorky? And then the New York Times or whatever started publishing Daniel Clowes, and every periodical ever started printing a couple thousand words every year or two about how graphic novels aren't just for kids any more, and now they aren't really dorky any more? Well, friend, Logicomix is doing everything it can to make comics dorky again. It's the story of half mathematician, half-philosopher Bertrand Russell and his struggles to pierce through the heart of all the bullshit, man, and get to the truth in math. Via philosophy. He hangs out and kicks it with Wittgenstein and Poincaré and Gödel, talking for three hundred pages about logical phallacies in the assumptions upon with mathematics as we know it is built. Interestingly, this is the most gripping stuff: as a hella meta exercise in contextualization, the frame story about the people making the comic is a lot less interesting, and the thread about the Orestes feels kind of boring. Who'd have thought! There are also way too many commas in this way that's not technically wrong but which annoys me. So... yeah the meat of this is basically a five star book, but the frame and mechanics of the prose are distracting enough that I'd give it four. If I had to. "
43,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,4,"Logicomix is a graphic meta-narrative based on Bertrand Russell's failed quest for mathematical certainty. It's hard to think of a subject intrinsically less interesting, but in the hands of these talented artists (Doxiadis, plus Christos Papadimitriou, Alecos Papadatos and Annie Di Donna) it's high entertainment, not least because they weave their own uncertainties and confusions into the mix. The theorizing is intense but unpretentious and the comics are rich in color and detail. And the story is actually ... interesting!I have no idea who the audience is for a book like this. It worked for me because (1) it offers same kind of quirky visual delights as Tintin (i.e., the line art is more European than overheated American superhero/Sandman stuff); and (2) years ago I read Bruce Duffy's completely marvelous The World as I Found It – which chronicles the misguided adventures of Russell, Wittgenstein and G.E. Moore at Cambridge in the first decades of the 20th century.In fact, if you're reading this review and at all intrigued, count yourself lucky and hunt down a copy of Duffy's novel. It's deeply rich and strange. Logicomix isn't in the same league (by intention) but it's thoroughly enjoyable in its own invented category."
44,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7185419-yanzhang,5,"One of the most personally devastating yet inspiring lessons learning mathematics was that mathematics would be insufficient to supply all truths sufficient for my own development as a human being. It was devastating since it killed my arrogant wish that I was part of a priesthood in which the hope of all mankind rested. It was inspiring because this could only mean that I've undervalued the other fields of human enterprise and that between all them they have been doing the right thing. One focus of this book is that the logicians in it (and I'd assume also those who came before and will come after) deal with similar phases, with enlightenment much deeper and more mature than my own, through journeys much longer than my shallow years and much harsher than my pampered life. Considering how many mathematicians treat logic in the same way the other scientists treat more mathematicians, it was personally an extremely valuable read. However, the parts of my souls that the book touched were not the same parts that activate when I read mathematics or the sciences; rather they reminded me of reading The Awakening or other stories of stepping out of fogs. In that, I think Logicomix is of an universal excellence."
45,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462980-emma,2,"This was good but not world-changing. It was primarily the story of Bertrand Russell's career as a logician and public figure through various stages, but not in too much depth, and to a large extent the story of early twentieth century developments in logic. This with interventions from the writer and artists as characters who intervene to tease out things they can't handle in the core story. It was not hugely innovative in form, though the clean European-style drawings were lovely, despite the fourth-wall breaking and whatnot (it was no The Three Paradoxes, for example, which I thought of often while reading Logicomix). I think it lost a bit by being a biography/story as well as being a sort of introduction to logic, as the story sometimes was sidelined by theoretical explication, and the theory not so in depth because the story was being told. I liked it, though."

I'm all for punch-em-out superhero comics too, but this book manages to seriously talk about history and math while still being entertaining. When I first figured out that the comic book creators are characters in their own book, I rolled my eyes, but it works. They're likeable, but they don't take the story away from Bertrand Russell. They ground it and provide a space for them to discuss some of the controversy or contradiction in the historical account of these logicians. Reading this book will not give you a profound understanding of Bertrand Russell or the history of mathematics, but it's a delightful introduction."

I thought I'd breeze through it, it being a graphic novel after all - but not really. That said, I think its still a good book to be introduced to the otherwise dense subjects of logic and math and their history, and to Bertrand Russel - whose name rang a bell, but no more. I had no idea who this man was and what his contribution had been to the mathematical world. Bertrand Russell was a philosopher, logician, mathematician and Nobel prize for literature winner."

A few splash pages are quite brilliant. Perhaps the most important messages here are that: (1) logic and madness are not all that far apart; and (2) reason has its limits and can never have completely firm foundations.

53,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5511477-forrest,4,"When I started this Cannonball, I unofficially put a moratorium on comics and graphic novels. It is so easy to argue that graphic novels are the equal of traditional literature, but I still wanted to establish a sort of baseline for the books I would be reading, and I couldn’t find a good way to fit, for example, twelve volumes of Fables comics in my definition of a ‘book.’ No less than a week out, I stumbled across Logicomix lurking in a corner of the house I’m staying in here. Like Persepolis, Maus and other graphic novels that straddle the divide between fiction and fact, Logicomix is a dense little novel that happens to be told with pictures. It’s a solid 350 pages and spins a tale that is one part story, one part lecture and two parts adventure. Comic or not, it’s a wonderful read and perfectly worthy of inclusion in the Cannonball.The creative team, lead by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou, set out from the very beginning to create an engaging story about the development of math and logic. Their vehicle for this story is the British logician and mathematician Bertrand Russell and his life experience as related to an audience of English World War II protesters. Russell, a noted opponent of the First World War, is sought out to provide a logical and philosophical basis with which to oppose British involvement in the Second. Rather then provide a definitive answer, Russell offers up his life story from which the audience is free to draw whatever conclusions they like.Simultaneously, the camera zooms out of the comic and away from the storyboard to see the graphical representations of the creative team, including artists Alecos Papadatos and Anne Di Donna and the research assistant Anne Bardy. The story here is a discussion of the more complicated ideas that Russell’s comic-self raises and a vibrant debate on the shape that the comic should ultimately take. These asides punctuate the densest points of the story and provide some logic-for-dummies explanations for the complex theories and ideas that get tossed around in the second half of the book.As noted by more than one wary reviewer, the combination of the authors’ points of view and the main story creates a bizarre sense of design by committee. Segments of the Russell’s life are referenced, but deliberately and explicitly skipped by the somewhat intrusive creative team in the interests of creating a stronger narrative. But they fracture the narrative every time they break into the story. The effect of the asides isn’t actually that jarring, but they seem to contradict the goal of the comic as laid out by Doxadis and Papadimitriou in the first few pages. The book becomes as much the story of making the comic, as it is the story of Russell.Despite the nonfiction tagging, Logicomix is more fictional than not. The authors have generated encounters between individuals who couldn’t have met and homogenized the language to a more modern baseline (although, it was pointed out to me that this may be due to the book being translated somewhat poorly from the original Greek.) The art is simple but really quite fantastic. Because of the dense nature of the subject matter, the art seems to take a background role behind large text balloons and expositionary boxes. There are some brilliantly illustrated moments, but the comic is largely just an unusual delivery method for some light philosophy.Logicomix isn’t everything it sets out to be, but it is a wonderful little story and a great discussion piece. Assuming you can find anyone else who’s read it. The central conceit, that logic can only be used to address half of any real world problem, is well worth the short time it will take you to read the book. "
54,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61179854-janki,5,"This is probably the toughest review I'll be attempting, since the subject matter had me venturing into an exploration of the quest for the foundations of math and therefore that of absolute truth. In THREE different meandering timelines. (Terra incognita for me, surely.) This absolute faith in mathematics is what gives meaning as well as drives insane, the protagonists of this story. A stunningly accurate yet minimalist account of the various schools of thought that underpin the mathematical world, It unraveled beautifully for me towards the end. It does a great job of laying down bare, extremely complicated questions that have plagued the scientific circles for centuries. Almost made it accessible to someone like me. Not sure how much of this can translate into referenceable material, but oh well.The book is basically Bertrand Russell, our narrator in this tale, addressing and trying to weasel out of a mob of protesters trying to convince him to join forces with them, in resisting Britain's participation at the helm of world war II. This is in the backdrop of Germany invading Poland. He offers for them to sit in on his lecture instead, where he launches into a spiel about his entire life in hopes of sowing the seeds of 'logical reasoning' in their minds. An attempt to allude to their better senses.I've never been a student of the humanities, and am quite sad to admit of having received no substantial education in such. But when books like these propose to tickle that part of my unstimulated brain, a roughly 300 page dive into LOGIC, 'the study of methodical thinking, deduction and demonstration', and how it straddles philosophy and mathematics; you can bet your bottom dollar it stoked a fire of revelations. I could especially relate to young Bertie (Bertrand Russell) ranting about how contradicting and confusing the tenets of philosophy are, and his angst to give it strong foundations and a logically precise language. The humans and their inspired journeys that grace these pages are fascinating to say the least. Take Gottfried Leibniz for example. He dreamt of a 'calculus ratiocinator' - a way to make thinking as clear as geometry. Wowza!We're introduced to the heroes of this book, and the real life giants of math, namely Aristotle, Euclid, Boole, Frege, Cantor, Gödel, von Neumann, Wittgenstein who each set out to prove to be able to sign off years of intellectual labor as 'quod erat demonstrandum'..only to have it subverted. Time and again. The final blow coming from Kurt Gödel's literal pulling of the rug from under the collective feet of the math community, with his bold proof that every question and 'logical' statement cannot be proved. And that is a recurring theme, not just in the book, but in life. That there is no 'royal road to truth' as Bertie puts it. No ready-made solutions. At a point in time where my country is donning the newest avatar of irrationality, the growing intolerance and hatred toward religious minorities is teetering on the likeness of Nazism. I resonated with Russell's helplessness on that one.Despite the rigid, intense nature of a work of these proportions, I'm glad the book wasn't a departure from the most basic, philosophical,emotional and existential struggles of the people involved. And for that, I have Apostolos and Christos to thank. The artwork by Alecos and Annie breathed life into a complex tale.Is it a tragedy, with almost each member getting engulfed in the throes of insanity? or a success story as the end result, because it is what led the world to Alan Turing and the birth of the modern computer as we know it today?..you decide."
55,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101529-gabriel,4,"This book is about one of the most polemic words I can think of. For some folks (especially teachers of the word), it is hard to think of words that divide folks faster than ... ""math.""Already a few of you are turning your screens around and clicking on buttons to escape the mere phrase. I'm sure a few of you have just now written off this graphic novel as ""unreadable"" or ""too intellectual"" or even ""boring"" for its association with the word. Others have their interest peaked and are ordering copies from Amazon right now.Logicomix: An Epic Search For Truth (though ""epic"" is in the eye of the beholder) concerns itself with a few dead white men (only one non-white man is mentioned, that in the Notes section ... Al Khwarizmi) in their search for a true foundation of mathematics. That is, the proof that the statement 1 + 1 = 2 is true and always true (a statement that our main character wrote a 362 page paper proving to be true). Throughout the narrative, we discover that which makes mathematics come alive for me; the story of the mathematicians behind the abstract thoughts. Inbetween the stories of the people around Bertrand Russell - and the abridged story of Russell - are the ideas that these men debated. This is the era when the absolute truth of mathematics came into question. This is the era when certain numbers were still relegated to the imagination of fools (and the ""imaginary numbers"" retain the name to this day). This is the era when Calculus went from something that ""just worked"" to a branch of mathematics with rigorous definitions. Yes, this was also a time when the world was dealing with the first World War. [Strictly speaking, this book takes place between 1876ish and 1940 with digressions in the present and Ancient Greece]Some of the most interesting stories of the history of math comes out in this period. The development of sets and the discussion of infinity (and how many types of infinity exists). The discussion of logic and whether it came from math or math from it (and also the logic inherent in other aspects of humanity). The book discusses so many huge ideas in the slim 300 pages ... its amazing it holds together so well.The artwork is wonderful. Oftentimes it is structured logically with more or less traditional 9 panel layout, but every so often that layout is destroyed or subverted to create extra movement or a break in the logic being discussed. Nothing new for readers of comics, but very well done. The narrative is wonderfully told, with the ideas being discussed in a simplistic manner - expanded on in the optional appendix - so that everyone can enjoy the history and the ideas discussed. Sure, this is a search in the midst of the abstract. The world being debated existing in the infinite (or even whether infinity exists in the first place ... it's a relatively new concept, folks) space where everything can be rationalized ... or not.Great book. Wonderful history (with some artistic licence here and there) and a great introduction to some of the most interesting aspects of modern mathematics (some of which is taught in high schools today).So put aside your worries about the word, ""math"" and see what the great debate is about. See that the ultimate truthfulness of the subject has been debated from time to time (and may still be). Then enjoy that the basic truths you intuit take 360 pages to prove."

How accurately d our knowledge represent the world around us?True, we model reality through our mathematical models. But what about Mathematics? It makes a lot of assumptions. How strong is the foundations of mathematics? Is mathematics immune to a siege led by someone who wants to prove that the foundations of Mathematics are shaky and hence the results churned out my mathematics aren't true - even if they model our situation precisely.Now, this problem boils down to a logical problem. A problem that can be solved only if we question all fundamental assumptions of mathematics and prove that they are consistent with eachother.Solving these problems, along with some more, led to the technological advancement we made in the second half of the twentieth century. We take computers and smartphones for granted, but we never come across the grinding process may great minds went through so that humanity is inching closer to the 'reality' of this life.This book beautifully describes this quest while walking in the shoes of Bertrand Russell. While we appreciate his genius, the book make us realise how human he was, dogged by the qualms and banality of a human existence and yet he managed to reach out to the abyss and turn up with something remarkable.And that contributed his set of bricks to the structure upon which the modern logic, mathematics and science rests. This book brings that 'joy of knowing' to laypersons like you and me. These enlightenments are so enlightening and empowering. It doesn't matter if we end up making our foray into the world of logic or not. It's all about knowing what Bertrand Russell, Gödel and Alan Turing went through so that we can have our smartphones!Much more than that, the book teaches us one thing. Do we need to undergo real suffering, if we are to reach real knowledge? What does it mean to attain knowledge? What implications do the pursuit of knowledge has on suffering of an Human being? Are philosophers the highest order of masochists? Reading this book will give you an answer. One of my all-time favourites, this book is a gem. Once you read this, you can embark on the voyage of ""Gödel, Escher Bach, the eternal golden braids"", by David Hofstadter. Wishing you luck, for the quest for knowledge shall never die and perhaps it will lead us to the meaning of existence, the direction of life in general and what is the importance of consciousness.

57,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3663641-jack-waters,5,"Logicomix is a graphic novel which combines fiction and non-fiction elements to depict logician and philosopher Bertrand Russell's struggle to discover the rigorous logical underpinnings of everything, especially mathematics. ""A dramatic story of madness and reason, love and war,"" so says the opening flap of the graphic novel, and is an apt description of the story in brevity.Early on in the novel, Russell is called upon in a lecture at the start of WWII to explain how logic can answer whether or not the USA should enter into the war.Cleverly explained by the authors via interludes of plot through flashbacks, part of the story is about Russell's emotionally barren upbringing, the specter of madness seemingly surrounding him, and the many struggles that he had throughout his life.Simultaneously with his personal struggles, there's a theoretical struggle Russell wrestles with -- whether there can be a firm foundation to logic and how logic relates to language, truth and the world.Russell is presented as a classic, typical hero -- orphaned, struggling in childhood with overbearing adults, moving on to his quest (for the foundations in logic), struggling with monsters (a streak of mental illness in his family, also found frequently among his colleagues), and coming to an end that is both happy and sad (depending on how it is viewed) but certainly complex.The stories of Russell and other major mathematical figures (Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt Gödel, and a leaves-you-wanting-more-out-of-his-story Ludwig Wittgenstein) are told enjoyably. Also, the theoretical discussions are both very clear and told in a way that any novice reader will find little difficulty in following the storyline.The late Howard Zinn said of ""Logicomix,"" ""This is an extraordinary graphic novel, wildly ambitious in daring to put into words and drawings the life of one of the great philosophers of the last century, Bertrand Russell. The book is a rare intellectual and artistic achievement, which will, I am sure, lead its readers to explore realms of knowledge they thought were forbidden to them.""The novel offers a few take-it-to-heart messages, that knowledge is inherently complex and incomplete, that dogma should be discouraged, and that there is a certain pathological bravery found in intellectual giants. All these messages are presented in the novel with finesse, exposing the flawed fabric of reality in a way that makes life bearable."

Few had impressive artwork, all seemed shallow means of telling stories better and more efficiently represented in text.Lacking something to read and visiting with a rarely-seen California friend who had brought several books to my attention, I, wishing to honor his attentions, gave all a glance. I'd read the Tillich and the Laing, but not the strange graphic biography of Bertrand Russell. The art was certainly not impressive, but the main figure was, as were some of the supporting characters, most notably Ludwig Wittgenstein.Thus, while having my first cigarette and cup of coffee for the day, I gave Logicomix a look. It 'read' quickly, very quickly, and it did deal with both Russell's life and its place in the world of ideas, mathematical, logical and philsophical. I'd read some Russell, most everything by Wittgenstein, but both long ago, so this seemed useful as a refresher. Besides, it had a lot to say about mathematics, a subject I haven't much studied since graduating high school.Reading it, I was surprised at how much I didn't remember from having previously read Russell's autobiography--forgetfulness, always a sobering experience. However, in an appendix, the authors acknowledge a great deal of dramatic license, they having created events which never occurred. While this was much appreciated, I wonder if it might not have better served readers to have made such mention at the outset."

When reading the book you're racketed from Russell's life to that of Wittgenstein, and then to brief biographical glimpses into the tragedies that accompanied many of those who called themselves logicians. An ongoing theme through the book is the intersection between madness and logic, and which rightfully births the other. Are logicians good at their jobs because of how obsessively they tend to all the little things? Or is it their focus upon what reality is that later creates that hyper focus? Can one reason oneself into insanity?The book is fascinating, and I was happy to lay my hands upon it again. I reserve five star ratings for books that I feel genuinely change and influence me... there's no doubt this book had a fine influence upon how I move through life."

In graphic novel form, it recounts the early life of the philosopher Bertrand Russell and his attempt to establish the logical foundation of all mathematics and the rational truth of all that exists. At the same time, it tells the tale of the group of graphic artists who are writing Logicomix, and their insights and frustrations mirror the ones that Russell and his colleagues experience. Additionally, (as if that weren't enough) the story ends with a metaphorical retelling of Aeschylus's Oresteia.Russell was a complex man who was haunted by the spectre of madness that ran in his family. From a very young age he was introverted and put all his effort into his quest to define ""the set of all sets"" at the expense of close personal relationships. He competes and argues with other great mathematicians of his time like Wittgenstein and Godel (also fascinating personalities). In the end, his quest is deemed a failure, although the authors of Logicomix posit the creation of the computer and the Internet as the natural successor to Russell's life work.This is a framed story in that Russell's life is told through a fictionalized speech that he gives to American isolationists on the eve of WW2 in which he tries to offer rational reasoning as to why war is illogical.In terms of graphic art, the line is similar to Tin Tin, and the pictures are captivating and cinematic. Just fantastic!"

But this and more happens, graphics/art is very good and cute and few large drawings are just brilliant but it's not regular and occasionally there are jarring mistakes where the graphics are not upto the mark but that's part and parcel of any Graphic novel so it's not a big issue. at 350+ pages it's a huge graphic novel especially considering that unlike superhero graphic novels here are no big action set pieces. The book is dialogue heavy as it should be. This is certainly a wonderful experience and I am glad that this became a bestseller because it does deserve to be every bookshelf at reader's homes.I have always loved comics, and I hope that I will always love them. Even though I grew up reading local Indian comics like Raj Comics or Diamond Comics or even Manoj Comics, now's the time to catch up on the international and classic comics and Graphic novels. I am on my quest to read as many comics as I can. I Love comics to bit, may comics never leave my side.

62,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11821551-farhad,3,"To be quite honest, I went in expecting something like Sophie's World, only graphic. But LogiComix is definitely not another ""Logic for Dummies"" or ""Your Cartoon Guide to Logic"". The authors make sure that we know that, repeating the feat again and again. The book is logically sound, and that's it. It rarely tries to teach logic. It tells the story of Bertrand Russell's Quest for the Foundation of Mathematics, it speaks of philosophers and mathematicians, and eventually their conflicts and birth of the half-man, half-horse centaurs, the logicians. And while being logically sound, doesn't attempt to teach logic. Rarely does it speak of the problems that is worrying our protagonist, touching only the nature of the problem. It references Russell's efforts in proving ""1+1 = 2"", but tells us little of the proof itself.And not being of the teaching nature, I'd expect the characters to be more explored and story flow to be swifter. Me being a avid comic reader, I'd also like to see the graphic media being exploited to the fullest. On both ends, I think LogiComix falls short. It remains an enjoyable read, but that's just it. Not much that I'll take away from it. And at no times did it grip me, the reader, enough. Neither as a historical fiction, nor as an adventure in solving the mysteries of Mathematics."

Certainly not the creators, it seems.Sorry. This was actually rather good - following the life of philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell, we're introduced to the basic problems of logic, math and human nature. It's well done - sometimes, it feels like there's a little too much going on (the introduction of the ""Orestie"" was a bit too much for my taste), but overall the structure works well. The precise explanations went a little over my head, but they always do when I read books about math and logic - I hate to admit defeat in that regard, but clearly I'm not a mathematician. It is a little sad to see that I remember exactly nothing from the logic seminar I took when I was still at university, even though I was quite good at it. Ah well, I'm not getting any younger, and there's only so much room in my brain ;)My main gripe is the apparent self-consciousness of the creators, which shines through a lot of the time. You want to make a graphic novel about math? JUST DO IT. Seriously, I know there are way too many people who think comics are just for kids etc., but there still is no need to justify yourself. If it's good, it's good. "
64,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2485937-alan-marchant,4,"Logicomix is very unique - a graphic nonfiction novel about the philosophy of mathematics. The book is structured around an autobiographical lecture by Bertrand Russell, with cameos by the great mathematicians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who participated in the ""Foundational Quest,"" an effort to establish a consistent logical foundation for mathematics. The quest came to an intellectually tragic end when Godel's ""incompleteness theorem"" proved that not everything in mathematics can be proven. I was put off initially by the emphasis on Lord Russell, for whom I've never had any patience or respect. But the human sympathy shown to him as a protagonist is more damning than any criticism. The heavily self-referential nature of the book - both the Russell lecture and the artists'/authors' frequent appearances - was also annoying at first. But in the context of a comic book on logicism, self-reference is justifiable as one of many examples of understated humor.One big error is the authors' insistence that computer science was the ultimate culmination of the foundational quest. This is a transparent example of the ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" logical fallacy. "

It was about that but so much more. Authorship. Insanity. Religion. War. The meaning of life. Greek literature... well, in a Jungian kind of way. Such intertexuality tends to choke me up. The ending to this one made me well up with the hope that there is an overarching sense about homo sapiens sapiens.Sometimes when I finish a book I yearn to be a superhero with the powers of causing people to read and comprehend the books I tell them to try. That was the case here. I wish every twelve-year-old who is going through pre-algebra could read this book. I wish every person who believes mathematics is devoid of soulishness would read this book. I think anyone interested in having a meaningful thought life, in connecting the tools we use to the way we think, in living an examined life, should read this book. Please read this graphic novel.

Will it appeal to me, a person who has always shied away and even hated Maths as a subject once upon a time? Logicomix introduces you to the quest of logical foundations of all mathematics in a unique, innovative form of a graphic novel. It is ambitious in it's objective. But nowhere throughout the book do you find this to be too difficult to follow. I loved it how authors delved into the essential concepts of logic and mathematics without making it too complicated. It has a cohesive narration which seamlessly integrates one event into another. The graphic novel format makes it hard to put down. Overall, the book succeeds beyond it's objective, it serves as a great primer to delve deeper into the subject.

74,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48062493-satwik,4,"4.5 stars, actually.	It is truly, an epic search for truth and meaning, and perhaps certainty. The book has a certain profoundness to it, and that too, the best flavour of the profound, the blurry, almost-within-the-grasp type. It is a great mixture of melodrama, artistic finery and intellectual stimulation.	First, the mundane praises. It is very well designed and illustrated, with a welcome appendix at the end and an easy to understand style of expositionary comic panels. The story length and content is well balanced, not too pedantic or technical to be dry, nor to dramatic to be messy.	Okay, now to the meaty praises. The self-referential expositionary first-in-first-person narrative is excellently refreshing, and somehow felt the best way to do what they wished to achieve. Speaking of the book’s intent, it is a blurred nebulous goal lying somewhere in between recapitulating a historical journey through the life and works of one of the most famous mathematical philosophers and his “quest” for consistency of mathematical bedrock, and a literary yarn asking all of the so-called rationalists to reflect upon the nature of rationality as well as the imperfections of the human condition, and posits an important proposition, as the book’s Wittegenstein exclaims, “The things that cannot be talked about logically are the only ones that are truly important.” The narrative is beautifully structured in a seemingly clear and logical way, yet the overarching theme is the limitations of the logic, or perhaps the dichotomy of reality and logic – very clear trees forming a foggy forest. Although I am no expert on the history of the events, from what little I knew of the actual events that transpired, I felt the freedom taken to add fictional elements and the level of historical adherence was a good blend of the literary freedom and the accuracy imperative. There are very emotional elements to the book, the (view spoiler)[frighteningly understandable tussle with the prospect of madness, the omnipresent sadness of dysfunctional families, the tormenting trials of stagnating work and thought, the weary realizations of the complexities of life (hide spoiler)] – all make this very logical book a human book at its core. There are funny parts too, sometimes subtle, sometimes more direct – but I find the book to be overall a solemn yet positive book.Cons- hardly any. Requires, as I say below, at least some amount of familiarity with mathematics or preferably some idea about the quest for the philosophy of math. It was a pleasure already knowing all the names mentioned and something about their contribution, it might perhaps not have been the same without, although that is only conjecture. I personally found the ending a bit too dramatic and abstract and perhaps confusingly metaphorical. But I nevertheless understood enough to enjoy the book – enjoyment inclusive of the new thngs learnt, new ideas encoutnered, the literary style, the artistic illustrations, and what not- which, after all, is the only purpose of a book (or perhaps, for life?).	Recommended for people who are at least minimally familiar with mathematics, or rather, the philosophy of math. The book does a good job of not requiring this prerequisite, but I felt it would greatly enhance one’s appreciation of the book."
75,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23148376-john-a-raju,4,"This was an enthralling read. I'd never thought of the possibility of a story around the ""quest for the foundation of mathematics"" being told through the medium of a graphic novel; the novelty worked very well for multiple reasons. For one, the creators seemed so cool with their self-references and illustrations of themselves, and it felt more like they were thinking out loud in terms of interpretations of Bertrand Russell's philosophical journey. The creative liberty of the medium also meant there were humour filled (not necessarily accurate) portrayals/illustrations of events, which expressed the ideas, frustrations, and lives of the mathematicians and philosophers (primarily Russell) and tackled these serious topics in an engaging fashion, without really slipping into flippancy.Apart from the novelty of the medium, I also liked how the story was not just about the theories and ideas but also about their context and relevance in the real world. Again, a story revolving around logic and its ultimate pursuit was not a place where I expected to see the classic trope - that of a character facing a fundamental conflict, attempting to resolve it, and coming out better for it - play out.Played out in the background of the first and second world wars, Russell's transformation over his journey for truth and certainty is best captured by the change in his stance towards war between these two historical events. I personally resonated with his outlook that one can't be certain about things or have a lifelong conviction that is absolutely right because even in mathematics/logic - the apparent paragons of certainty - there is no assurance of certainty. Russell's quest for certainty essentially taught him to be open to uncertainty, to be ready to consider changes to his convictions and above all, apply them beyond the realms of theory.With respect to the mathematical and philosophical theories themselves, I feel this book is one that can pique your interest around ideas in the field but would need further exploration. Overall a really good read."

It tells you that applying formulas is not good enough - not, that is, when you're forced with really hard problems.""This biography tells the tale of a brave logician on his (endless) quest for unshakeable truth. Bertrand Russel is shielded from all things controversial from early childhood on. All this secrecy around knowledge, both personal and universal, only seems to feed his curiosity. Once he finds a way to break free, the world of logic invites him in. Along with the best minds of their time, he fights his way to the logic of life itself. Everyone seems to be desperate to build solid on which to securely base their ideas. But what if there is no one way to approach anything?Mathematics is nowhere near my field of interest, nor my field of expertise. The philosophical element of the story was what initially drew me in. I actually consider myself a rather dreadful logician, I tend to overcomplicate things rather than apply logic. Perhaps that is why mathematics has never really done it for me. All that aside, this graphic novel is beautifully written and drawn. The story is accessible and even if some of the theories went over my head, I could very much appreciate it. The researchers that occasionally interrupt the story as they piece together the story were a bit disruptive at first but a saving grace later on, when so many things were happening at once. The overall message of the story is quite comforting. There is no map of how to deal with life that tells you what to do at what time. There is no ""right"" way of doing it, in that respect. I am certain that people with a heart for mathematics and logic would massively enjoy this book. Seekers of truth with philosophical tendencies will feel right at home as well."

The guest for the Foundations of mathematics is a journey that many have embarked and none have finished, but all of the men and women that tried have made major contributions to the fields of Mathematics, Logic and Philosophy and proved that all of these subjects cannot exist one without the other. Logicomix is one of these quests, and sets us at the very begging with its star player, Bertrand Russell. Through is tumultuous story we are being introduced to Logic as a foundation of our very existence. We encounter along the way a number of great minds in the field of Mathematics and Logic. The form in which the story is told makes it very attractive even to audience that does not have a particular love for the subject (Maths). Russell is the narrator of the story and also the parallel we are introduced to the creators of the novel and their quest for writing it. In many ways you can consider it a comic book with superheros, in this case super-humans, the journey is like the Odyssey, like a Greek tragedy, as most of our heroes end up in a not so happy place.I totally recommend it!"

An ingenious premise of following the life of Bertrand Russell and his quest as a logician - combining a furious truth-seeking journey with the various friends and family members left by the wayside. My biggest issue with the comic is the use of multiple framing devices - Bertrand Russell tells his life story in a lecture while the team making this comic discuss events that take place and share some opinions. Some of the discussions added depth, others just added fluff. I’m still not too sure what the main theme of the comic is. It’s partly about how Russell’s search consumes him, his struggles with madness, his relationship with apprentice-turned-rival Wittgenstein and his inability to sustain any meaningful relationship outside of his quest for Logic. In trying to cover all these themes, the comic was unable to give a comprehensive and impactful experience of any of them. I feel that this is a comic that reads better on the second try so I’ll keep it in the back of my mind."

I will admit that I was interested for about 150 pages, but then the math kept dragging on, and I could care less about the foundations of math. The logic and madness aspect of the book, well I guess you could say it nearly brought me to madness. The story mainly focuses on a story of a man sharing his story, but that man and his story are being told by other people as if his world was fiction. Basically, it is story inception. The man tells his life from a kid and learning math and logic, to growing up and becoming a mathematical logician to the point of where he is now. The art style is pretty good, and stays pretty static throughout the whole book.

87,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927396-mark-russell,4,"The narrative of Logicomix begins on the eve of America's entry into the Second World War. A motley alliance of Communists, Nazi sympathizers and isolationists protesting America's entry into the war stand outside the lecture hall where Bertrand Russell, one of the 20th century's most prominent philosophers and mathematicians, is scheduled to speak on logic's relationship to human affairs. As Russell (who was once arrested for being a pacifist during World War I) approaches, the protestors welcome him as a natural ally. The crowd calls for him to join their protest. Instead, he counters by asking them to come hear his talk. They agree, listening impatiently for him to throw his verdict, and that of logic itself, squarely against the war.What they (and we) get instead is a guided tour through Russell's personal history and that of his Arthurian quest for a provable, logical basis for mathematics, and consequently, all human knowledge. The journey takes us from the darkness of his religious upbringing, to his epiphany at the hands of Euclid, to his continental adventure to meet the heroes of the burgeoning field of study known as logic. Ironically, in his quest to formalize a logical, non-contradictory basis for mathematics, he succeeds only in destroying it's greatest hope: set theory. Supposed to provide mathematicians with a safe tunnel under the monsters of contradiction and unsolvable paradox that plagued the landscape of traditional mathematics, Russell's Paradox instead proved that set theory was every bit as prone to quandary and irrationality. It also made him an instant rock star in the field of logic. Russell spent the next decade in a stormy, thankless struggle to undo the damage that his paradox had unleashed. Working with Alfred North Whitehead, the result is the Principia Mathematica, bought at the cost of Russell's marriage, his friendship with Whitehead and very nearly his sanity. Recognized as a milestone in human thought today, in its day, the Principia was almost universally ignored, largely because it was only really understandable by about half a dozen people in the world. But one of the people who does get caught in its net is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who compares the dense treatise to Mozart and moves to England to seek out Russell.Under Russell's tutelage, Wittgenstein embarks on a similar quest, which culminates in his own magnum opus, the Tractatus. But far from achieving Russell's goal of providing a logical foundation for knowledge, Wittgenstein's work shatters the very notion. According to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (most of which was written in a World War I prisoner of war camp), logic fails because it relies on language, which is inherently given to paradox, irrationality and misunderstanding. Not only does Russell's dream of a logical basis for human knowledge take a beating, but his hope for a rationally guided human race is also undermined at every step by the senseless destruction of the first World War, the ever-present spectre of madness in himself and his heroes and the rise of the brutal and chauvinistic Nazi regime. The dream of a logical foundation for mathematics finally dies at the hands of Kurt Godel, whose Incompleteness Theorems demonstrated once and for all that paradox is an inherent part of mathematics. To which John von Neumann (himself worthy of a book or two) simply says, ""It's over.""Logic, it seems, is not a magical arbiter of truth, the apollonic gift of light bestowed upon a human race eager to come out of the darkness. it is simply a tool, the ends to which it is used dependent entirely on the morality and the motives of the user. In the end, Russell is speaking, not from his intelligence so much as from his wisdom. Just as paradox is a demon which will forever haunt mathematics, our emotions, our intuitions, our prejudices, he concedes, are just as much a part of who we are. In the end, we cannot choose between logic and emotion, but must find a way for them to coexist. There is no uniform standard for the truth. We must all make our own way. The message Russell leaves the audience disappoints them. I, on the other hand, was anything but. Though the journey can be a little dry at times, and admittedly the quest for logic doesn't exactly lend itself to such a visual medium (a man standing in front an equation on a chalkboard can only be so dramatic), for someone interested in philosophy, philosophers and the relentless search for truth, it is a spellbinding journey.Logicomix works on both levels, as biography and as a history of philosophy. Most of the conflict arises from Russell's attempts to reconcile his life and his dreams with his work, and periodically, the authors and artists interject themselves into the struggle, arguing amongst themselves over the direction the story should take, whether Russell's work was a success or a failure and over the nature of logic versus reality. In my opinion, any good story makes us care for its characters. And when all is said and done, Logicomix works on a basic level because we care about what becomes of the stoic and quietly passionate Russell, the brilliant but irascible Wittgenstein and last, but not least, the authors themselves."

100,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5368477-daniel-roy,3,"I loved this graphic novel for its subject matter and its ambitions. Alas the result, while entertaining and interesting, falls a little short on both accounts.Comics are quintessentially a visual medium, and thus would seem ill-suited for such an abstract topic as the logical foundations of modern mathematics. That was a big part of my initial attraction to this work, and indeed the subject matter, rather than transcend the medium, proves the mismatch. But let me back up a little.There are a few layers to the story of Logicomix. The central, and most important in terms of page real estate, is a biography of the great Bertrand Russell. This story in itself is a worthy topic, and ambitious in its own right. But this story is, in turn, framed by other narratives; Russell himself narrates his own life to a pacifist audience on the eve of World War Two; and this story is, in turn, the topic of a discussion among the creators of the comic as they are creating it. Whew.The central story of Bertrand Russell is engaging, if ultimately frustrating. Russell was a complex man, and not just for his revolutionary ideas about the foundations of mathematics. The creators clearly establish their angle on his life story in the framing narrative: they want to discuss the link between reason and madness. An interesting theme, sure, but it neither illuminates Russell's life, nor does it provide anything more than chitchat fodder for the creators. And ultimately, we don't get to really understand Russell. Why did his first marriage fall apart? What made him have an open marriage with his second wife? What drove him to advocate conscientious objection for World War One conscripts? What drove his ideas on education? All this is brushed over, and the comic makes no attempt at resolving them or offering a possible answer.The framing device of Russell's conference is, likewise, more frustrating than illuminating. Russell, confronted by pacifists who want him to take position on the brink of World War Two, recounts his life story, with the promise of bringing it back to the topic of war in the end. But the story provides no insight; it just stops, open-ended, at what feels like an arbitrary point in time.The topmost layer (or group, I guess) is that of the creators themselves, discussing the comics they are creating in comic form. I get why they did this, and it's a very clever mathematical joke. In doing this, they make of Logicomix a group that contains itself. It's a play on Russell's Paradox, and a nifty one at that. It's just too bad that what's said here isn't all that great. The creators try and expose the inner workings of their narrative structure, and in so doing, rather than providing it with more depth, demonstrate their lack of direction and lack of answers. In other words, the framing device robs the overall work of depth by telling, rather than showing. It's eerily similar in structure to the narrative layers in Spiegelman's Maus, but is nowhere near as transcendental.And so, the end result of all this is an ambitious but imperfect telling of Bertrand Russell's life and work. It explores some of the mathematical concepts he struggled with, but it never has the space nor the narrative luxury of dwelling too deep into them. A lot of discussions, which normally would have taken their time to emerge from a written work, are rushed through here, driven by the implacable need for images to drive the action. Characters react with a lot more theatricality than they assuredly did in real life, because comics, after all is said and done, still require pantomime to remain on the safe side of illustrated books.Is Logicomix a case of creators reaching the natural limit of comics' potential to tell an abstract story? Or is it simply its creators who, having sought a new frontier, found their own hubris? I don't know. I'm still glad they tried."
101,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5880260-jimm-wetherbee,4,"There is a story of a newly minted Ph.D. entering her first position as an assistant professor of philosophy. The department chair assigns her (as one might expect) to teach a basic course in the history of philosophy. “Well,” the new assistant returned with some hesitation “I suppose I could go back to Early Russell.” It is a bit of an exaggeration, but there was a time with the Anglo-American (or Analytic) School of philosophy that it seemed generally assumed that--with the possible exception of David Hume--philosophy, real philosophy, hadn't really been practiced until the advent of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell. Logicomix is a graphic novel of the world of Bertrand Russell.A graphic novel, a comic book about a philosopher, you ask? Well, why not? First of all, Russell was not only a philosopher and public intellectual, he was an out-sized character. While Logicomix leaves out a fair bit of Russell's life prior to World War II (and includes nothing thereafter), what it does include of Russell's personal life will show that a philosopher does not have to be dull.But why a graphic novel? There may be a number of reasons, let me take a stab at a few. First, analytic philosophy can seem extremely dry. This is in part because it is so formidable, so abstract, and so mathematical and removed from what one would think of as philosophizing that one does not dare approach it, lest one catch the contagion. The graphic novel serves to make the theory of types, set theory, the incompleteness theorem, Hilbert's Hotel, and (naturally) Russell's Paradox accessible, almost whimsical.There is certainly the danger that any such illustrated treatment might serve only to reduce the topic to “Anglo-American Philosophy for Dummies.” Logicomix cleverly avoids any dumbing down so that even those who study philosophy for a living will enjoy themselves. There is also a lot going one in this novel. There Russell narrating his story as an argument for why his, pacifist that he is, will not join the protesters over America's impending entry into World War II. In it he relates his quest for certainty and complete rationality and why that quest should lead him not to protest but a lecture on the “Role of Logic in Human Affairs.” Along the way we come across almost every major philosopher and mathematician of the first half of the twentieth century—along with Russell's personal escapades (Both Russell's time with Whitehead and especially Wittgenstein are well worth reading). This by itself goes back and forth. Add to this that the authors and illustrators appear in the novel to form a running commentary. If that were not enough, an attentive reader will find that the very structure of the book illustrates some of the logical problems that inspired and bedeviled philosophers of those palmy days.So then, why Russell? To begin with, Russell is both formidable and approachable. He was, as I said, a public intellectual and worked to make his ideas the common coin of the realm. Also, because he was in contact with so many thinkers of the day, Logicomix is able to bring in an entire intellectual milieu.And if you are not interested in types, universal sets, and the like, Logicomix asks questions about what it is about people (or at least certain people) to go to incredible lengths of abstraction in the pursuit of truth, rationality and certainty? Does such an obsession itself lead to madness, or is it a curious mad genius that impels some of us to pursue truth absolutely? A fair number of people around Russell either become mad or are wildly eccentric. It should also not go without saying that Logicomix makes a point that this ardent pursuit of rationality, truth and certainty came hand in hand with what has been to date one of the maddest centuries in human history. If uncertainty is a given, is the pursuit of truth in vain, or is it necessary for us to grasp what truth we can afford?"
102,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,3,"TODO:+++ A new sub-genre of graphic novels, which focuses on historical figures of intellectual interest, here, mathematicians, and their quest for truth or achievement. I am very glad about this trend, first, because the field of graphic novels is maturing and starting to take more on the ""serious"" topics, and, second, because difficult topics such as the search for the fundamentals of arithmetic can thus be made accessible to masses (people like you and me). In this sub-genre, one could drop the heroes and focus on the content, like in Economix: How Our Economy Works (and Doesn't Work) or The Cartoon Introduction to Statistics, or drop perhaps much of the focus on content and focus on the person, like in Feynman the graphic novel. There's actually so much in this genre, that about ten graphic novels/comic books are dedicated only to statistics. Take your pick. +++ Logicomix takes on an excellent scientific quest, of finding (or even defining) mathematical certainty, and its specific problem of finding a foundation of arithmetic, one in which every statement could be proven either right or wrong (so, no more axioms, no more obvious). Such a foundation would be based on a logic free of paradoxes, where two correct proofs could not lead to opposite conclusions. There are few topics that could be as abstract, yet, as Logicomix shows, whose principles could be more easily depicted. ++/- Logicomix does not focus actually on the scientific quest, but on the characters who pursued it, of which Bertrand Russell is a worthy main protagonist. This figuratively speaking giant of science is known for his high quality thinking, logical and mathematical work, and, through his quest for proving theorems, setting the basis for what was in some steps and decades to become computer science. Computer scientist Christos H. Papadimitriou, late addition to the co-authors list for Logicomix, is the second main protagonist, which, despite liking Christos and his professional work, does not excite me. ++ The authors get perfectly the atmosphere of a field of science. I did not know the field of mathematics is so exuberant, so perhaps the computer scientist among the authors painted using the emotional palette of his (and my) own field, but the taste of how science progresses is realistic to me. --- I absolutely disliked the way every bit of progress is explained through a mental breakdown. From experience, I understand the immense nervous drain that science can put on its protagonists, and how a long-term obsession can lead to separation from most human endeavors, but the mental anguish presented here is on the one hand likely to occur in most scientists yet here is presented as the defining part of their lives. It's not, or there would be few genes passed to a new generation of scientists, and Christos would be a far less likable person. This part seems drama for the sake of drama, for the hero must have outstanding qualities that everyone can understand. Just sayin'; you would have also gone mad with the speed of information and communication technology in Bertrand Russell's time. +++/- The main techniques in telling the story are flashbacks (-), a supposed speech given by Russel that ensures the storyline (+), and a post-modern take in which the authors explain the content and give historical/character background (++). I am not a big fan of flashbacks in any medium, but the storyline and its support framework work very well indeed. Well done! +/-- It is a graphic novel, but the graphics are really the least interesting part. Unfortunately, this part is not one that I liked. I enjoyed the relatively realistic style, which matches the scientific pursuit, but overall I found the scenes not inspired and the integrity of the style (lines, color palette, types of objects and their contour) rather lacking."
103,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34583105-norman,3,"Interesting enough but an overall lukewarm presentation. I didn't find Bertrand Russell all that exciting - if anything, I thought there could have been more characterization and less wallowing. Of course, I wonder if that's the fault of the subject. Perhaps it would be too much to glamorize a philosopher. After all, how interesting is a thinker's life when looking in from the outside?"
104,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This review contains some spoilers, both about the logic and about the story of Bertrand Russell's life, but it will probably not alter your enjoyment of the book. Also, I won't give away what Russell says about our involvement in World War II -- read the book to find out. And you probably already knew about Goedel's proof, or you wouldn't be tempted to read it in the first place. This is a nice book! This book is about Bertrand Russell and a talk he gave just at the outbreak of World War II, when some were urging him to speak up against Britain's involvement after Germany attacked Poland. Russell's answer is a long, round-about story of his life, including his own opposition to World War I. Russell's real passion, though, is logic. What is good about this book is that it tells me things I didn't know about Russell, and also because it is not just about math, it's about life. Is everything in mathematics logically true? It is necessarily true, but is it logically true? As Goedel puts it in this novel, ""is every mathematical statement provable, either the statement itself, or -- if it states something false -- it's [SIC] opposite?"" That's the question. And the answer is (turn back now for logic spoilers):No. And Goedel proved that no proof is possible.I had already struggle to try to understand Goedel's proof. No, I've never worked through the original proof, although I read a couple of other books that at least give the outline of the proof and what it means. My main claim to expertise here is that I took a graduate course in logic and got into Goedel's first proof, of the consistency and completeness of predicate logic. But I don't recall how that went and I've long since passed on the textbook. Don't read this book to understand Goedel's proof, although you will get a pretty good idea of its implications. What's really charming about this graphic novel is the human interest. Russell's interest in logic, and its all-consuming presence in his life, really has a decisive effect on him personally. I really felt sorry that his first marriage didn't work out, and I think they should have worked harder to save it. I also finally understood Wittgenstein, and how he could become so famous and well-respected, even though he never seemed to say anything. He had a way of asking questions that seemed to have deep implications; he understood the weak point of philosophers, and kept probing around these weak points, saying things that could not really be contradicted, and which seemed to have ""deep"" implications, but without actually saying anything. Perhaps Wittgenstein was a mystic, but my suggestion is that if you want Zen, you should study Zen (and by the way, I do), don't study Wittgenstein.One thing the novel does NOT point out is that Wittgenstein never accepted Goedel's proof. In my mind this shows that Wittgenstein was as confused as those he deliberately or inadvertently confused. Anyway, this book does require some thought, but I recommend it. I am not giving it five stars just because I don't think it's for everyone. I anticipate some people will just say, ""what the heck is this about and why did they turn it into a comic book instead of a term paper."" (Answer: comic book is more interesting). And also because of that typo in Goedel's statement of the problem of mathematical logic. And also because I am tired of having to compare ""Sense and Sensibility"" with books like ""Keynes: the Return of the Master."" Talk about logic! So generally if I really like it, I give it four stars. "
105,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6984857-petros,4,"This is basically a remake of an earlier work from the same author. “Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture” was quite the unusual read for trying to offer entertainment through one of the most boring sciences ever. Math! In quite a similar way, this book is also around the obsession of mathematics but at the same time it is far more grand-scaled than the previous work. Instead of just dealing with the life of a minor mathematician in modern Greece, Logicomix revolves around the life of a famous one and takes place a century ago, when mathematics where reaching their peak and several new discoveries were made. It even delves with the world war and interacts with other famous mathematicians the protagonist met. It is definitely a lot more epic in scope. Most people would find math to be boring and useless, nothing but theories without a practical use in everyday life (outside adding or multiplying). The book focuses on the life of a mathematician and shows why this type of people loves it so much. Turns out (if you don’t know it yet) that mathematicians love solving enigmas concerning numbers. And not in the same sense as others solve puzzles or sudoku; they love proving or rejecting theories by using formulas. Thus we practically see the life of such a person as he tries to find a solution to everything via numbers and hard facts. As emotionless or boring as that sounds, it is in fact a very humane story that focuses both on its characters, as it does on the so-called infallible numbers that control the universe. It is a biography first, and a mental search for the truth second. We see their daily lives, their mistakes, their passion and disappointment, as they try to write down a mathematical formula that proves right or wrong every question possible. It is not by any means a hard to grasp tale; it is easily accessible for most readers. All its complicating mathematics are presented in quite the easy to grasp way and it is mostly what the characters do throughout the years, or the methods they use in order to find the truth, and less on endless pages of dribbles regarding weird symbols. The author is a mathematician himself (amongst other things) so the story was written from the perspective of one and feels very believable and honest. At no point does he try to deify math and present propaganda for people to pick up his favorite subject. He does describe the beauty of looking for numbers to solve something but he also never forgets to pinpoint how devastating it may be if you offer your life to just that, and how you may spend it in vain or get mad along the way because of your obsession. Thus it is evenly presented, never taking sides or trying to enforce a one-sided idea to the reader. As far as artwork goes, it is not exactly professional in overall, as several times body motions and perspective look weird. This is counterbalanced by the way everything is meant to look chaotic and symbolic. As far as the flow of the narrative goes, the graphic novel tends to blabber a lot at times, and may feel as silly for some. For example, why is the mathematician explaining all that before an audience right about when the Nazis are about to start their war? Makes little sense…Aside from a few hiccups in terms of storytelling and artwork, it is a very good work in overall and I recommend it as something both educating and entertaining. "
106,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10215537-roberto,4,"I started reading this graphic novel without many positive expectations, just a kind of prequel =S to a book recently recommended by some friends (""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", by D. Hofstadter). But, actually, it turned out to be a surprisingly good and dynamic story, whose many poetic licenses were, for sure, totally justified."
107,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1942730-paul,2,"When I first saw this book I thought it was right up my alley. I love comic books, mathematics, logic, philosophy and history. In particular I have extensively studied both the history and mathematics discussed in Logicomix. I was very excited to find that this book existed. In practice i was not very impressed. logicomix narrative reads like a poor mans version of Wolk's Reading comics, in that it employs a similar feel but with a strange three tier metaphysical narrative structure that was jarring and poorly executed. I am not sure why they went the comic book route. The only possible reason I can think of would be that one of the authors read something like Wolk’s book and wanted to use it. The authors justify using the medium of comics by saying that the story is one of giants, like ""... Superman, Bertrand Russell"". I feel like they really missed a key opportunity to slip in a nod to Nietzsche. While I know this could complicate the narrative (adding nihilism in the mix would have been tangential and Nietzshe was no logician), it would have been highly amusing to us who like philosophy and comics and it would at least tentatively tie down the use of the medium (anyone who has studied Comics history would understand what I mean). The only really benefit to this terrible narrative structure was the revelation by a writer of the comic that ""...maybe eventually they confused their reality with their maps"", referring to an oft pointed to but poorly developed notion in the story about logicians and insanity. I feel like Wolk did a much better job on this particular point, or even some of Gamain’s work makes this point better.There were horrible factual mistakes. For example Russell's older brother, Frank, introduced Russell to Euclid, not some random teacher. Frank is mentioned in The Logicomix, but only to tell us that the writers didn't think he was important enough to add into the narrative. Like I said I have studied the Princia, Godel's incompleteness theorem, The Tractatus, logic and axiomatic mathematics) and I found the explanations of things in Logicomix painful. We find Russell telling Aly about Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel shortly after they are married. This is fine and good but it is done 30 years before the lecture was given (they were married in 1894 and the lecture was given in 1924) and it is a very poorly explained version of the idea. Also Whitehead’s role in this is highly downplayed, which I take offense to, in part because I am a big Whitehead fan. These are some (far from all) of the many problems I have with the text.All and all Logicomix raises good issues but doesn't really do a good job addressing them. For someone like me the text is painful. I think for a pop level introduction to the material, with an explanatory note that there are a lot of problems with the writing, history, characters, logic and if the reader had access to someone who know what they are talking about the book is fine."
108,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749108-ohenrypacey,2,"Disappointed is the one word I would use to describe my experience with this book. It's hefty, and, on first glance, appears to be rather substantial; but the fact is, it ends up being a short story (perhaps it would fill 50 pages of conventional text) peppered mostly with illustrations of Bertrand Russell lighting a pipe.I am familiar with this story. I would guess that most readers interested enough in the characters (Russell, Wittgenstein, Godel) would be as well. The authors clearly state early on that Logicomix is not meant to be ""Logic for Dummies"", and it isn't; but its not much else either.The essence of the book (caution spoilers) is that Bertrand Russell, celebrated mathematician and philosopher and noted pacifist, is confronted, early in the 2nd World War, by isolationists hoping to have their position validated by a sound logical argument. Russell proceeds to tell them of his epic search for a language of truth (mathematics) to lay a firm foundation for expressing things in an objective universe. The authors, who liberally inject themselves into the narrative, then begin an argument over whether madness (a pervading theme in both Russell's life and his professional associations) is a product of logic or a symptom of the search for it.At this point i would have thought that the medium (illustration) of this work would have made itself felt, and that the authors would have taken some care to illustrate some of the trickier aspects of the mathematics or philosophies that the story revolves around. In fairness, they try just that with Russell's Paradox (and some cute barbers), but there is far too little of this and far too much of great minds doing mundane things. Frege harvests roses; Cantor scribbles madness; Russell lights a pipe.Now I wasn't expecting another Godel, Escher, Bach, but Doxiadis has written better books before, so I was at least expecting that he would respect the audience who would naturally pick up a book of this type enough to ask his illustrators to do more than draw themselves walking around Athens, or draw Bertrand Russell smoking a pipe.In the end Russell gets around to explaining to his audience that if the greatest minds of his age (Wittgenstein not withstanding) could not figure a way to ground the foundations of logic in an objective reality, then there could be no infallible logical argument against fighting the nazis. Here should have endeth the lesson, but somehow the authors felt the need (madness perhaps) to take us on a journey to see Aeschylus' Oresteia, the moral of which (mercy?) seems to have no place at the end of this story.I was hoping I could recommend this book to those who might want to become more familiar with the characters without charging into GEB, or DFW's Everything and More, or even, *-forbid, the Tractatus, but it's just not very well executed. "
109,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"This is a must read for both lovers of comics and smart laymen who want to be entertained with history of ideas, great men and logic.The sober, soft and pleasant narration (sometimes, a meta one) is built around the biography of Bertrand Russell, as told by himself in occasion of the prelude of the intervention of England into the WW2. In a note, the authors mention that though all characters are real as well as all ideas reported, some facts are fictituos for the sake of simplification of narrative only. This does not detract from the content, especially considering the appendix to the book containing additional notes and biographical materials.Russell's life is seen as a voyage to discover unshakeable truth, along which he comes to grasp the complex nature of life and reality, which lies mostly beyond logic. An underlying theme of ""logic from madness"" connects the lives of many of the logicians with which Bertie comes into contact, and can be applied to his case too, as if the discipline, endurance and clear-minded thought required to solve logical foundational quests could only spring from a repulsion, fear or dread of madness, or were the outcome of a desire to find order in one's own mind and life. Apparently: Russell's son was diagnosed with schizophrenia; Hilbert's son was psychotic; Cantor believed himself to be god's spokesman and spent his later life proving Shakespear's true identity (Sir Francis Bacon) and Jesus as son of Joseph of Arimatea; Frege became paranoid and used logic to prove the need for a final, anti-semitic solution; Godel died of starvation because of his paranoia; Wittgenstein was extremely eccentric, so to say. Of all, Russell, with his multiple marriages and libertine attitudes as well, seems to have embraced the most aspects of life, and for this to have become the wisest, dedicating himself to militant pacifism, philosophy and education in general, though being constantly ravaged by the thought of his failure in curing the foundations of logic that he earlier showed to be rotten (with his paradox on set theory).Drawings are very neat, elegant, with some tables in full page format of grand eloquence and beauty. There is a constant exchange between the authors' and Russell's narration, which makes the text a metatext at times, when the authors themselves are represented and comment on the evolution of the book, its themes, some philosophical propositions and the supposed failure of Russell's foundational work - which can be compensated with the inspiration of works by Wittgenstein, Godel and Turing, which lead to moder computers and computer science at large (which prefers pragmatical algorithms to structural formal reasoning in itself).A unique work deserving to be a must read in high schools - and to be largely imitated."

111,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a birthday gift from a friend. In thanking him, I mentioned that it was good to stretch myself on format as well as content. The “comic” format allows for a quick introduction to the subject, in this case, the life of Bertrand Russell and various side figures including Wittgenstein. At least as portrayed here, Russell is a flawed figure – a true believer of sorts who sought absolute truth and certainty in mathematics and logic (a “manic passion for certain, absolute knowledge”) and, in failing at that task, Russell redirected his quest to perfect “humanity” by remolding it through scientific psychology. The most sensible person in this book is a woman figure who, commenting on Russell and Wittgenstein, said, “Zey both want to fixed everysing with zebrain.” Given Russell’s unfortunate upbringing, it’s interesting to speculate whether his passion for absolute perfection in science and scientific humanism was compensation for an impoverished childhood. In this book, for example, Russell reflected on his “early years” when “Euclid saved me from the clutches of Grandmother’s stern religion. The promise of certainty in total rationality was my dream of a perfect cosmos. My own vision of Heaven.” At some point, Russell realized that if one starts from the wrong premises, “Logic can be the executioner’s handmaiden.” But the same can be said about his approach to humanity. “How to straighten ‘the crooked timber of humanity’?” he asks. “How to annul the harm done by instinct, emotion and habit?” When one starts with “ze brain” as the cat’s meow, instincts and emotion become our animal side, a problem to be overcome in light of someone’s notion of perfection. Russell is not saying that some emotions are good and some bad. Rather, he’s saying categorically that reason is good, and instincts and emotions are bad. “Every human being” he states in this book is “essentially split into two persons. The one a paragon of purity, whose credo was Reason” and the other is a “disgusting reprobate, always seeking unrestrained voluptuousness.” Russell does not see that Reason is not only easily pervaded with subjectivity but it is also used to impose on the interest of others. It comes down to one’s premises: If one’s primary interest is without regard for the interest of others or the whole, then it’s rational to do what it takes to promote that interest, even if it involves manipulation, deception, and imposition. Stalin and Hitler-like figures, in other words, are rational people (though not of course regarded as such by those who oppose them). "
112,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32235779-najmie-bin-maliki,4,"I chose this book from its cover. Not literally the cover, what I meant is this book looks entirely unique. A mathematics book, in a graphic novel (or comic, whatever it is called) form. How ingenious.At first, I was expecting some futuristic setting of a protagonist jumping back and fro between the future and the present or past, stumbling upon some paradoxes along the way. Instead, the setting was actually around the late 19th century and the early 20th, and the hero is a real character, Bertrand Russel, a logician, and his real life story.Well, sort of real life story. The authors explicitly told at the end of the book that it does not intend to be historical; in fact, they admitted that they deliberately alter the truth to make the story nicer, just like a movie adaptation. But the gist of it is essentially real.And depressing. You read the names drop, Russell, Whitehead, Cantor, Frege, Hilbert, von Neumann, Wittgenstein, Gödel, names that makes you drool. How grand was the time. Vienna Circle. People devoted their lives for intellectual truths. They all came from wealthy families, that is why they had time to pursue those obsessions. But I never saw the ugly side, that their lives weren't all rosy. In fact, most of their lives are rather tragic.The book is meant for lay people, people who in some point in life developed a passion in mathematics, but ultimately know we are not as good as we think we are, or we came to realization that mathematics or logic or philosophy (or anywhere in between the blurred lines) can never really make money, or can only serve an extremely small population of the Earth. It is written to be easily understood; in fact it had little symbols or equations. It focuses more on the story of people, the struggle, and in that sense, it portrayed well. Russell and Whitehead wrote over 300 pages to prove definitively that 1+1=2. That encapsulates their obsession for the truth.Overall, an exquisite work. And very honest as well I have to add. The conflicts between the co-authors were included as well. Just like Principia Mathematica (which itself was co-authored), it can be argued that it is an unfinished work. The co-authors (of this book, not Principia) could not agree to an ending - a happy one or a tragic one. And Russell's struggles probably mirrored any other thinking being's struggles, just that his life is a magnified version of our (or my) mostly uneventful one."
113,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54121179-hyun-jae,4,"Logicomix is a graphic novel that recounts a journey of philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his search for a strong logical foundation of mathematics, he challenges certain mathematical concepts that were generally accepted by people. For example, one of Russell’s contradiction included paradox in ‘subset being the set itself’. Although in Algebra, we learn that all sets have a subset that includes every element. However, according to Russel, this can not be true in real life. If we were to have a village full of bearded people and the barber has to cut everyone’s beard, it would not include everyone in the outcome set. Since barber himself can not cut his beard, the subset can not include everyone. Russell explained in a way that we could understand, but it is harder to comprehend in numbers. Apostolos did a wonderful job in showing a mathematics journey of a philosopher in pictures and visual devices. There were moment-to-moment techniques that build suspense in certain scenes. There were montages in some scene to create a dramatic feeling. It was interesting how the writer of this novel is also part of the novel. In scenes where several writers discuss of where Logicomix is heading towards, this graphic novel certainly broke the fourth wall and communicate with the readers. Although Russell couldn't conclude on his journey to searching for absolute truth, his works and efforts are definitely remarkable.In this world, there still are many questions that aren’t answered. Logicomix certainly brings that issue and emphasize that the reality is still flawed and imperfect. This is why physicists and mathematicians still discover new concepts and continue researching indefinitely. The biggest discussion question we could draw from Logicomix is ‘Is there absolute truth? If there is one, then can we reach it?’ I personally believe that there is absolute truth, but we can never reach it. All the physical phenomena that happens in this world, humans were able to quantify those phenomenon and make it a truth. I believe all these sub-truths build up to one absolute truth - a truth that would include all categories of the universe. However, we can never reach it, because there are still tons of phenomenon that is not only physical or mental but also spiritual or supernatural. But, no matter what your idea about absolute truth is, humans will always seek for an answer to any questions and will know little more about the universe. "
114,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5635335-christina,3,"I sincerely appreciate rigorous, genuine searches for Truth. So, while much of Russell's approach(es) to his own search doesn't resonate with mine (I'm more okay with less certainty, I guess), I enjoyed reading about his efforts.Moments that resonated with me most:When Evelyn is sick: ""Staring into her eyes I faced, terrified, by own mortality. Yet... A newfound sense of responsibility showed me a way out of my despair... An occasion for a surprising new outreach to life... In Evelyn's eyes, I'd seen the stark, unvarnished image of our predicament... The tragic loneliness of every human being. The finiteness and profound futility of life. The terrible harshness of pain and disease. The unmitigated horror of death. But talking to Eric I understood there is also an alternative: Redemption. In compassion... In love..."" (233-234).While Wittgenstein is fighting in the war: ""This is one of the major disadvantages of Reality: from up close, it looks very different from any 'picture.' [...] The meaning of the world does not reside in the world!"" (249-250)Wittgenstein and Russell: W: ""My book delimits language, thus also thought. But the real issue is beyond all that... it's how to live... and of that we cannot talk! All the facts of science aren't enough to understand the world's meaning. For this, you must step outside the world!"" R: ""Without language or thought, how can you understand anything?"" (261) [I know Russell's take on religion, but Romans 8:26]Delightful: Duchamp, Dada, Yeats cameos :)Russell: ""So how to straighten 'the crooked timber of humanity'? How to annul the harm done by Instinct, Emotion and Habit? To my mind, there could only be one answer, a rather obvious one: Education. But of what kind should it be?"" (277)Russell to the crowd at the end: ""Well, maybe it's time to try another old triad: Responsibility, Justice... even a sense of Good vs. Evil, i.e. all the concepts my Viennese friends considered 'beyond the dignity of serious minds.' Listen: take my story as a cautionary tale, a narrative argument against ready-made solutions. It tells you that applying formulas is not good enough -- not, that is, when you're faced with really hard problems!"" (297)"
115,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858718-dave-morris,3,"Let me just start by saying that I wish comic books could get wider acceptance from the literary establishment even when they don't tackle ""serious"" subjects. You know, Stephen King can get an NYT write-up for a hokey old thing like 11/22/63 and even Lee Child has an EngLit don following him around, but comics have to take on the Holocaust or the history of logical positivism before quality newspapers would ever dream of reviewing them.I just wanted to get that off my chest. It's not Mr Doxiadis's fault. What he has done here is create a really good biopic about Betrand Russell. You know all those movies about people like John Nash and Stephen Hawking, where they try to tell the story of the person's life through their work -- or maybe I mean vice versa. But the problem is that movies are a visual medium and you've only got 100 minutes. Comics, as much a literary as a visual medium, are much better suited for the job. And this is a good comic, not just a ""Modern Philosophy for Dummies"" thing but a genuine story that gets across Russell's character and life along with his theories. It helps that the artwork by Alecos Papadatos is excellent: dramatic, characterful, charming.As for the subject matter: Russell is an intriguing character. Apparently a lot of people who worked in the field of logic ended up going mad - or were barmy from the git-go. I can believe it. They fret about stuff that honestly doesn't really matter a jot as long as maths can get your spaceship to Mars or calculate the right topology for a plasma containment field. Often the discussions of Russell and his colleagues come across like rabbis arguing over obscure bits of the Torah. That's not a criticism, by the way; I think Doxiadis nailed it there. I'm curious that he felt the need for a framing narrative, in which he and his maths consultant Christos Papadimitriou talk about where they're going with the story. Again, not a criticism, just an observation that a novel, TV drama or movie probably wouldn't do it that way.The framing device does allow Doxiadis to parallel Russell's great intellectual crises with the story of the Oresteia. But to go into why that's relevant would spoil the fun, so I'll leave it there."
116,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396524-ryan-rebel,2,"I'm rather disappointed in this book, in retrospect. I saw it on a bookshelf in a math study room and it looked interesting to me. I like graphic novels, and I like stuff that stretches your brain, and there were dominoes on the cover. How could I resist?I found it at my library and I didn't, in fact, resist. It's not that I'm upset that I read it--I zipped through the thing, mostly in a single day, so it can't have been that bad. It's just that I don't think it held up on the ""compelling narrative"" part of the bargain that it actually promised that it was doing within the text.Yeah, there was a whole annoying little meta frame narrative about them in the process of writing the graphic novel. It was kind of pretentious, to be honest. And annoying. In fact, a lot about the book annoyed me. The perpetual smiles on everybody's faces. The complete disregard of the moral atrocities of our ""hero"". The stupid ""my life story will clear up what you should do about World War 2, even though I'm mostly not going to tell you about logic at all, nor will I clear this debate up when I'm finished talking about my life"" gimmick of the second frame narrative (yes, there were two frame narratives...).In summary, I guess I learned enough from the book to call it worthwhile. It provided the brain-twisters that I was expecting (although not as much as I was hoping it would). But it was really crappy as a story, as a ""compelling graphic novel"". The creator seemed to think quite a lot of himself as a writer, writing himself into the story as one of the heroes just because he was writing...this story. In case it's not obvious, I disagree with those lofty opinions."
117,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183719-slap-happy,4,"It was timely how I picked this up at the same time I was reading The Great Shadow. Each have to do with madness; one point of view comes from that of a logician and mathematics while the other, a poet, who revels in mystery and the indefinable. The character of Bertrand Russell from Logicomix, who was a real person, by the way, and the proxy charcters for Mário de Sá-Carneiro, tried to circumvent reality from opposing orientations. Russell had spent the majority of his lifetime applying logic as a means to find ""true knowledge"", so we could assess empirically the world that surrounds us. No irrationality, no delusions! On other hand, Sá-Carneiro plunged into the dark recesses of (what he called) the Great Shadow: the imagination on a pedestal - to the degree of severity that one's inner life becomes corrosive and all that there is. Wallow in mystery; scorn the material world! And yet, each guy was lost in their heads and, I guess, how does that saying go? ""Missed the trees for the forest."" I guess I should say that Russell had wanted to understand the trees and the forest, but forgot to appreciate it by experiencing its realness. Sá-Carneiro, he said, fuck the forest, I don't see or care about no goddamn forest, I see castles and amorphous imaginings, 'n shit. This other stuff is all in the way. Russell's intention was a nobler one, of course, and he realized his folly as an older man. Plus, he didn't succumb to the ""logician's madness"" either. The poet, however, he killed himself by the age of twenty-six. "
118,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486245-charles,2,"I was very disappointed by the book. Rather than an ""Epic Search for Truth"" -- truly as bold a subtitle as is possible, it quickly became a ""Vienna Circle for Dummies."" Let's not kid each other: the genius logicians of this time -- including Russell, Witgenstein, Godel, Hilbert, Frege, Cantor, and Turing -- thought, wrote, and debated points of elegant, complex, and subtle mathematical intricacy that is vastly beyond the comprehension of almost all mortals, certainly including myself. But, reducing it to a comic book style, narrated by Lord Russell, is -- well, is just silly. It is sadly true that these great mathematicians and logicians were inbibed with mental illness (many), quirks and idiosyncracies (all), and family and personal tragedies (again, probably all). To emphasize these tragedies boarders on the voyeristic, in my opinion.To whom would I recommend this book? Serious students have already read the original works, or, should do so. Neither Tractatus Logicus Philosophicus nor Principia Mathematica is ""light reading."" Godel is even more dense, and more brilliant. Those with passing interest to the Vienna School would be better directed towards the few books that attempt a logical synthesis. This book is not sufficiently profound, rigororous, historical, nor comprehensive -- it is glossy and superficial, glitzy and parapatetic, more provoking than thought provoking. To whom would I recommend this book? I guess the answer is: no one. "
119,1596914521,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2757501-shannon,1,"Several times in this book, the authors describe their intent to create a graphic novel rather than a text book. If they are worried that the reader may forget, then perhaps they are doing something wrong. Ultimately, this book does come across like a text book.One of the major advantages of using the graphic novel format is to let the pictures tell the story. In Logicomix, there are very few plates without conversation bubbles or narrative text, making it possible to read the book with little inspection of the drawings. The narrator makes me feel like an unobservant fool - that I need an emotion described instead of inferring from a facial expression. Are they not confident in their ability to tell a story using pictures alone? Give the reader a little credit.Pedestrian format asides, I found the storyline to be drawn out and lacking in emotional engagement. While there are moments of sensitivity, the biography comes across more like a Wikipedia article than a stirring biography. Near the end, I began skimming scenes and dialogue - I simply didn't care.My conclusion is that, while an intrepid undertaking, the creators of Logicomix were too logical in their creation of the book. With a little creativity - and cutting out all of the scenes of the authors discussing the book - this could have come closer to achieving what I believe to be their goal: a historical tragedy of the giants of logical thought."
