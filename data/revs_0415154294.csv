0,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2269105-michael-p,5,"Relativity makes perfect sense when I read about it, but I cannot explain it to anyone once I close the book. Perhaps I do not REALLY get relativity after all, but I certainly thought I did while working my way through this book. It is clear, concise, and readable. It probably is not Lord Russell’s fault that my clarity closed as I turned the last page."
1,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,5,"This should go on the shelf, books stolen from my father. This was a pivotal book when I read it at the age of 13 or 14. I should read it again, I might have missed something the first time."
2,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6737841-prithvi-shams,5,"In explaining relativistic Physics, Bertrand Russell launched a formidable attack on our instinctive knowledge of Physics that have been nourished by our school and high school curriculumn, and when the dust had settled, it was he who stood the victor. I can't say I have understood each and every line of the book, but I can vouch that my conception of Physics has changed."
3,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4497443-tom,3,"I understand relativity only vaguely more so than before I read this. I don't know whether that's due to my own inability to comprehend it (most likely), Russell's explanations, or relativity itself (also likely)."
4,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2264393-wendy-yu,4,"I am wholly unequipped to summarize the learnings of this book b/c I understood maybe ten thoughts, and when I think about those thoughts, I am sure that I misunderstood them. That being said, BR is a terrific writer and being confused by his wit and writing is preferable to being confused by almost anyone else.Thoughts I think MIGHT be true from the book:- all things in the universe are in motion relative to everything else, there's no proper point of reference- conventional physics and Euclidean geometry fails when things are in motion, which everything is all the time- speed of light never changes, even when it emanates from something in motion- at speeds close to the speed light, time + mass warp- if event E on earth happens after light travels from event A on a distant star to earth, A definitely happens before E, and vice versa. If events are happening WHILE light is on its way, it can be truly said that A and E happened BOTH before and after and simultaneous with each other, depending on your vantage/velocity, and of which all are equally valid. ???????- time and mass are only ""proper"" when measured by two things travelling at same velocity- hydrogen bombs are powerful b/c you can build them as big as you like -- they will detonate only when a uranium bomb's heat activates them. uranium bombs cannot be built super big b/c they are unstable and will blow up- the shortest distance from one place to another is a ""geodesic,"" on earth these are the ""great circles""- light bends toward gravity- there's no such thing as a ""force""- gravity is like a hill, and matter (which technically also doesn't exist, somehow) is lazy, and will take the path of least resistance, which is why the earth goes around the sun instead of over it. now that i type this out it makes zero sense.Book dish: yummy atoms."
5,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77148-srdjan,4,Written with the typical clarity and wit of Russell. Only reason its not 5 is that i still dont understand relativity. I may be hopeless
6,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45799073-myat-thura-aung,5,"Taking the stance of an epistemic structural realist, Bertrand Russell lucidly expounds the theory of relativity and its philosophical consequences in a way intelligible to a layperson.Many science popular books have been written about Einstein's relativity theory. Yet only a few would have a philosophical interpretation as mature and incisive as that of Russell presented in ""The ABC of Relativity"""
7,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"My first attempt to understand Einstein's concept of relativity. I read a Croatian translation of this book (which I've lost meanwhile). Though it was a very interesting read, it made me believe the Theory of Relativity is simply much too difficult a subject for me to comprehend. The analogies weren't revealing.What a wonderful feeling it was when I started reading 'Galloping with Light', i.e. 'Relativity Free of Folklore' and realized I was not beyond hope, that all I needed was to be taught how to think and interpret physics notions and concepts properly.P.S.I've just found an English copy of this book (electronic version) and browsed it. Now I can't help but keep asking myself why I thought this book was much shorter than it really is. Maybe because I went through it too quickly when I had come to the conclusion it wouldn't make me really understand Relativity Theory.I should re-read this book in the light of what I've learnt reading 'Relativity free of Folkore'. Perhaps I'll change my 3-star rating after my second pass. "
8,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960038-ashish-jaituni,5,"A classic! I read it years back. I enjoyed every page of it, every word of it. It's nice to learn relativity from a philosopher than a physicist. It got me interested in the philosophy of Physics. Very well written like other Russell's books."
9,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10021852-amar-kamat,4,"If ever you wanted to know about the consequences of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity (things like time dilation and curved space-time) without seeing a single mathematical equation, this book is for you. "
10,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11726764-goran-markovic,5,"Read it, get confused around the middle, be glad you have read it once you have finished. This is a short, extremely helpful, introduction to Einstein's Relativity Theory. It's about spacetime you knew something about it!"
11,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,1,Gave up on it after 39 pages. I just found it too confusing and the examples were unrelatable. The book smelled nice though because it was old and musty :)
12,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188204-jayanth,3,"ABC of relativity is as complex as #$! of relativity. Though the author has tried to explain relativity through multiple examples, please dont expect any eureka moment in understanding relativity."
13,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9622500-jeffery-martin,5,Bertrand Russell is a giant amongst thnkers
14,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1816075-christopher-trader,4,A masterful work of making Einstein's theory elementary to understanding.
15,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287783-matt,4,"Mr. Russell's instruction on General Relativity is really good.He does a great job discussing the importance of the constant of the speed of light. He gets into what happens when we perceive events that happen in an interval less than the speed of light and also greater than the speed of light. I didn't quite get one of his train analogies but I do plan to reread that material.Equally important, he provides nice discussion on the idea of what Time Space is.Also, because it is General Relativity, he does talk about objects traveling on geodesic paths and non-euclidean coordinate systems.The book is only about General Relativity and only minimally touches on quantum theory.Definitely a nice companion or supplemental reader to other readings on Relativity, including Dr. Hawking's books.Finally, I really do need to give credit to Newtonian Physics. Sure, maybe it isn't accurate over long distance and euclidean space doesn't work over long distances. But we've been building things and moving things using: F = ma for a very long time!"
16,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"I only knew Bertrand Russell as a great philosopher and writer; consequently, I was quite surprised to find that he wrote a book on explaining Einstein's special and general relativity for the public. I decided to read this book despite I've read many before regarding this topic. I still learn something new every time I read physics books no matter how many times I've come across the topic. What caught my attention for this book is the philosophical perspective of the writer towards science. Being humble and open to change and criticism is what I love about science. Here's one of my most favorite quotes from the ABC of Relativity:The final conclusion is that we know very little, and yet it's astonishing that we know so much, and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power."
17,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"This is the fourth book I have read about Einstein's Theory of Relativity and it was the clearest explanation yet. I still don't fully understand it but I feel that Russell's explanations and examples got me closer than I had been before.His writing style is clear, enjoyable, and full of side comments and personal quips that make a very ""heavy"" read much more enjoyable.If you are interested in E=MC2, this is a great book to start your exploration."
18,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27846107-missfede,3,3.5 starsQuite an interesting introduction to Relativity even if not very simple. Russell's writing is clear and compelling but I have to admit some of his examples aren't as effective and enlightening as I had hoped. Like some reviewers said there isn't really an eureka moment in the book where the relativity theories appear crystal clear. I still learned a few very interesting facts though and I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject. 
19,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93718025-ahmed-ahmed,2,Couldn’t finish the book. Although bertrand russell is one of my favorite philosophers but he really failed to deliver the essence of relativity. Physics has been always my biggest disappointment but still his illustrations are poor and the book is devoid from any colorful modern approaches. One mist definitely consider the time this book was written in too
20,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103383800-giovanni-gardinale,4,"(4.5 stars, actually) It made my brain hurt, but I loved it. It's a must-read if you have any interest in the workings of the universe. Clear explanations and examples, but don't expect a light divulgative work, because it goes deep in the implications of Einstein's relativity and challenges our instinct and senses and everything we've been thaught."
21,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26034375-jonathan,4,"I enjoyed his style and despite its being dated and reading quite a few modern books on relativity still found myself learning from this due to his different perspective. Very little maths in this one. I can imagine and calculate consequences of relativity a bit better, and the ideas or concepts are finally sinking in by degrees."
22,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8779131-jason,5,"Definitely a great read for the imaginative. Sir Russell shakes up the ideas we learned about in school, making for an interesting read for me."
23,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47238538-d-h-marks,5,Good review of Relativity not requiring calculus
24,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92847905,4,A great book which answers many important questions abot our universe and how it works. I highly recommend this book for people who want to enter the world of physics
25,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106387229-ab,5,Revolutionised my entire understanding of physics and the external world. A great introduction to Relativity.
26,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99243336-barlaensdoonn,5,This book stands the test the time of over a century as one of the most approachable and digestible resources on Einstein's theories of relativity.
27,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40545757-bubonic,4,"Overall a good introduction to the special and general theory of relativity. Some of the examples that Russell conveys to explain the underpinning concepts of relativity are a little obfuscated and may require a second reading through or at least leaving the reader responsible to meditate on the illustrations. Russell highlights the Lorentz transform to show the mathematical reader the formula for such things as time-dilation and 'interval'. He gives a good geometric construction of the ideas behind interval and space-time. His chapter on space-time makes the point of why we need to replace the phrase 'space and time.' This is very well conceived notion and is explained in brevity. My only complaint is he become a little pedantic with respect to what matter truly is though it is an important chapter. He remarks about the apparent inconsistencies that exist in unifying general relativity and quantum physics; an inconsistency that still exists today! Lastly, he gives a philosophical take on what relativity theory may mean.The reader interested in understanding the concepts of relativity will do well in reading this book. It is by no means outdated although some new facts have come to light."

Plus this is actually my first audiobook: usually I prefer audioshortstories!Passion, studies and eventually work have always led to my reading mostly fiction. Often I've felt in need of some scientific divulgation for a change. And given my long-standing fascination for astronomy, I thought starting from the basics would be a good idea!One of my favourite passages is taken from ch. 12, ""Conventions and Natural Laws"":If people were to learn to conceive the world in a new way, without the old notion of 'force', it would alter not only their physical imagination but probably also their morals and politics. In the Newtonian theory of the solar system the sun seems like a monarch, whose behest the planets have to obey. In the Einstenian world there is more individualism and less governement than in the Newtonian. There is also far less hassle: lazyness is the fundamental law of the Einstenian universe.Groovy.According to aNobii, this is the abridged version. Owning (the Italian translation of) the complete and updated edition, my take on this point is ""so much the better"": the additions do not add much really and, if anything, they lessen the beauty and power of Russell's spare, clear prose.This gem is recommended to all lovers of science and audiobooks alike!"
29,0415154294,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30381590-vinod,3,"Anything from Bertie is hard to passover .Being the ace logician and meta philosophical genius that he is , he attempts here to unravel the implications of Einstein's relativity theory and what it means to anyone living on the third rock from the sun . The language is exceedingly common as he paints a broad canvas and introduces the readers to a multitude of concepts and the co-relation between them . Liked how he illustrates the very humble notion that we still have a lot to learn still and aspire to in a metaphysical manner. Personally however , i left this book with a strange feeling that i really didn't understand anything in the very end , yes i am noob when it comes to quantum particles and astro physics .Perhaps , its what Bertie boy was aiming for after all , being the sneaky brat to force us to explore and be curious ! .

This is a great way to understand the impact of relativity on thought. The idea that perspective is everything, while very specific in its utility in science and math has real impact on philosophical thought. This book is a reminder that philosophy and mathematics were not so separate as it talks about the conceptualization and abstraction that is required to be able to see a line as not the shortest distance, to envision that time matter and energy are related, and to understand what might occur when traveling at the speed of light.This is short and simple.
