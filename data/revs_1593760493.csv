0,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123397-andrew,3,"some decent history here, which i usually dont have a taste for. the author's british boarding school attitude looking down at the rest of the world (and occasionally critically at his own) can be distastefull at times (i guarantee you'll be surprised by the bold generalizations of some of his pronouncements. for instance, one sentence begins ""Though the Arabs had and still have a very low opinion of actual physical work...""those kinds of things crop up throughout the book, but in general you just learn that he's kind of a grump, who had enough money to spend his life writing and doing research in the grand scholarly tradition. And most of the book bears the fruit of that time spent. "
1,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1371376-leah,3,"Since I'm carrying on with my summer reading project, even though it's no longer summer anymore, here's the latest installment. I was really looking forward to reading Seeds of Change (Henry Hobhouse, 1986). I'd heard from someone else, years ago, who used it in writing a research paper, that it was a really great book. I also happen to love books about food, plants, science, and history. Win-win, right?Let me start by saying that I certainly learned a lot from this book. I probably could have learned more if I'd been taking notes or annotating as I read. This book is packed, and I mean jammed, with information. For such a short book (232 pages, and that's counting endnotes), it ranges over most of world history, with some botany, biology, and archaeology thrown in for flavor.This book devotes one chapter each to quinine, sugar, tea, cotton, and potatoes, describing the history of each plant and how its use by humans has affected our history. This might sound a lot like Michael Pollan's Botany of Desire, and while they share a basic theme, the two books are quite different. Pollan's subtitle sums up his approach--""A Plant's Eye View of the World.""While Pollan investigated the history of several plants and their interactions with human history, casting plants as the active agents and using their stories for environmental and political discussion, Hobhouse's starts and ends with human history, with much less emphasis on botany and current politics. Hobhouse's book is very much a product of its time: the 1980s revisionist historians' push to change the dominant historical discourses (Howard Zinn is the major example, of course). As such, the book contains some odd-sounding phrases and habits of writing; he uses lots of ""mankind,"" ""fellow men,"" and even engages in some surprising stereotypes (the industrious Asians, the inscrutable Chinese, etc).I found each chapter of this book fascinating, full of historical information, and well-researched (complete with endnotes, clearly written for a more academic audience than Pollan's book). But many of the chapters suffered from trying to be a little too complete. For example, the chapter on tea is so wide ranging (because the topic itself is huge) that trying to pack all that information into one small book chapter was a mistake. In the introduction, Hobhouse summarizes the impact of tea on human history: ""Tea was more than an incident in the American War of Independence, was instrumental in the development of porcelain in Europe and China, permanently influenced sailing ship design, and by transfer in the nineteenth century developed 'gardens' in Indian and Sri Lanka which changed the history of the subcontinent"" (xiv). Just summarizing these events is a massive undertaking, so it's not surprising that reading this chapter was slightly overwhelming. I found it hard to even process so much information.The chapter called ""Quinine and the White Man's Burden"" (see what I mean about the language?) is another one that, while fascinating in its information, is far too big in its scope. Not only does Hobhouse write a fairly detailed history of white peoples' interactions with the cinchona tree and quinine (the drug derived from the tree's bark), but he tries to squeeze in a quick summary of the history of synthetic drug manufacturing and its origins with the Germans in the World War II era. It was just a little too much; it felt tacked-on and awkward.The chapters that are more circumspect work better. The chapter on cotton and the American South, for example, was very interesting and much easier to follow, since it was confined to only two continents and a fairly limited period of time.I'm happy to have read this book, but it didn't grip me in the way that other Natural Revisionist History of [Insert Noun Here] books have gripped me. Recommended if you're really into food, plants, or European history (like I am!)."
2,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3282557-marc,4,"I really liked the premise and approach he used: important plants, their products and influence on history. As a biologist, I imagine this concept could be taken further; Animals of ...; Snakes of ... (politicians included); Lakes that Changed the World. But I digress.The author draws interesting conclusions about human history from the roles that he infers these plants played. Since most of the history he illuminates, I have long since forgotten, it was informative although perhaps not as provocative as some might think. Of course, the section on Cotton and the U.S. South will no doubt raise some hackles since the issues are still too close to the quick. Most of it was fairly straight-forward argument but this is not a forte for a certain part of the American psyche. I found the Potato section most interesting. His thesis about free trade theory and the famines of Ireland were insightful and thought provoking. Each plant section was short enough to be readable in one sitting. However, the author writes elongated sentences with structures that were frequently difficult to disentangle without re-reading (see Quotes below p. 156 for example). I found this style to be reminiscent of Victorian writing. This is why I didn't give it a 5-star.Quotesp. 21 ""...damning with faint praise,..."" ah yes indeed, the art of the feintSugar p. 45 ""Candy is dandy, liquor is quicker."" attributed to Ogden Nash (news to me but of course completely believable)p. 51 ""Though Arabs had and still have a very low opinion of actual physical work, they were excellent planners, managers and agriculturalists."" Dubious in Dubai; Stop at the comma and insert Academics instead of Arabs.Cotton p. 156 ""The distinct feature of American life is not the nobility of the Founding Fathers, nor freedom from the arbitrary rule of kings, nor escape from the tyranny of Europe, both secular and religious. Nome of these desirable attributes would ever have been achieved if the key had not existed: a relatively empty continent. ... Cheap, virtually empty, fertile land had more influence upon the early settlers than all the rhetoric of all the politicians who have ever inspired, amused, or saddened an American audience, and has shaped the American character more than any other factor.""p. 161 ""...the American South the first self-supporting, self-breeding slave system the world had ever known."" ...well speaking of faint praise ;-)p. 165 ""There is a certain school of historians in the United States that sets out to prove that slavery was more efficient than free labor."" debunked by "" a fivefold increase in the value of the slave against that of the bale of cotton."""
3,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7378159-karen,4,"Hobhouse explores how six plants affected the course of human history: Quinine, which cures malaria but requires exploiting rain forests; sugar, which lead to slavery and ultimately human disease; tea, tied to opium, and the breakdown of Chinese innovation; cotton, requiring a slave class in America and transportation brought by an Industrial Revolution; the potato, whose failure to thrive caused starvation in one country and a flood of immigration in another; and cocoa, spawning a complex drug culture with which modern man still wrestles. His notes are as fascinating as his narrative. Thoroughly researched.A memorable quote: ""The capacity of most people to occupy themselves usefully without spending money is diminishing."""
4,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Five economically important plants from a historical viewIf James M. Cain wrote history, this is the style he would employ. Hobhouse's terse, unflowered prose moves the narrative along, and he has an attitude: cynical. If you liked Marvin Harris and Jared Diamond, and I know you did, you'll like Henry Hobhouse because he has a similar myth-exploding, cant-debasing, and finely tuned BS detector a-working.The five plants are quinine, the potato, sugar cane, cotton, and tea. He's a little thin on the properties of the plants, but strong on the historical consequences. His explanation of why slavery died and why it remains a dead institution is excellent. (NOT because it is immoral, although it is that, but because slavery is inefficient, economically speaking.) Beware some unusual syntax. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

Enjoyable, though I had a personal hard time through some passages, as they are very detailed and thoroughly developed, but it certainly makes for better understanding of the viewpoint. It is always refreshing to look at world history from alternative viewpoints, like ""Napoleon's Buttons"" (Le Couteur & Burreson), for example, or ""Collapse"" (Jared Diamond)."

It made for dense and slow reading for me but it was fascinating. It covered far different ground from Pollan's Botany of Desire even though they both chose the potato. If you like one, you will probably like the other, especially if Pollan's book left you wanting more history or if you read this one first and find it a little too stuffy. "

13,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40378929-strider,5,It was a great idea to write the history through the stories of six plant. Six plants that we take today for granted but which had such a big influence to humankind.
14,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5958401-peter,4,"A revealing and fascinating bookand/orA catalogue of the crimes of the white man.Essentially 6 documentaries reminiscent of James Burke's 1970's 'Connections' TV series. Mr Hobhouse begins each chapter from several starting points, and weaves from such disparate beginnings a complex and informative narrative/biography exploring the formative nature of one of six economically important ""..largely tropical plants, which, after being transferred to countries other than their native habitats, became important to the new producer and to the consumer in many unusual ways. Yet their real significance was in their side effects upon the humans who became involved with their production, distribution or exchange""  The emphasis is on the ensuing socio economic repercussions of trade and cultural intervention and the facts speak for themselves; White European colonialism, portrayed in an unbiased light, is shown to be, at the very least responsible for more exploitation and criminality than any cultural or economic enrichment.Whilst some of the tales are woven from established chains of causality and fact, some of the interpretation of initial conditions or later consequences are inevitably more open to interpretation. The end product is a thought provoking attempt to examine and assess the predisposition of these cultures to the introduction of the various plants as well as the socio-economic culture that their production and trade created. For example, the cost in human life and suffering of African Slavery is here calculated at 1 African life to supply 250 people with sugar per year, dysfunctional cultures like Haiti the Confederate South are explained, or the state of the nation resulting from Anglo Irish relations prior to the introduction of the potato is shown to have enabled it's introduction. On this point there are few books that I have read that correctly interprets the conflict between English and Irish cultures as an inherent clash of race, ie Celtic v Saxon rather than religion; protestant v Catholic. This is top class historical commentary. Educational, stimulating and very readable.To summarise the chapters; QuinineIt's discovery as a treatment for malaria opened up whole areas of the globe previously uninhabitable to everybody but the already immune African Negro, whilst attempts to synthesis it's active ingredients led to the discovery of various dyes, vaccines and cures. facilitated Western European Colonialism TeaA catalyst to several wars with China, France, Spain and the Netherlands, plus the American war of independence, the creation of the opium trade as a mechanism to bi pass Chinese attempts to manage their affairs in foreign exports and the consequent alienation of China and Japan from relations with 'Western Europeans' as well as the abuse and destruction of the ancient and highly civilised Chinese culture.SugarIncurred the loss of countless African lives through a slave trade created to feed western Europe's demand, which is tantamount to an addiction.Used as the economic basis for whole colonial cultures where indigenous populations were wiped out and replaced by a master/slave society: A pattern of exploitation, mismanagement or abuse of whole societies and economies follows; a legacy which remains in the Caribbean CottonThe whole Southern confederacy's slave economy, as above, based upon a monoculture and intimately linked to English industrialisation and working class poverty. A story full of irony: at the time of the civil war, the American South's most valuable asset was it's slave population not it's cotton fields.PotatoSimilarly, the problems incurred when a suppressed and persecuted population is kept at subsistence level or made to depend upon an agricultural monoculture.Irish culture suffered American culture gained.CocaAfter centuries of use without problem or issue by Amerindians, is purified and abused by the white man and turned into a world wide social problem and the basis for a highly lucrative and corrupt criminal sub culture."
15,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821374-nicole,2,"Quinine, sugar, tea, cotton, and the cocoa plant are his plants of choice to represent the changes in power structure between the dominating Europeans and their colonial conquests. Quinine for opening up the tropics to a level of domination not previously possible. This was directly responsible for the sugar, rum, slave triangle that grew from the development of the new colonies. Cotton was added to the slave trade with American growth. Finally comes the drug trade based on the cocoa plant.This is one view, and a highly personal view, of how plants as medicaments food and as addictive elements have driven the social changes. Hobhouse clearly classes sugar as an addictive substance and in the sense that humans have no regulatory feedback to limit the intake then yes humans do succumb to the drive for high energy food intake with as much damage today as if it was toxic substance.Humans were once rate limited by high energy nutrients so needed no feedback to specify sufficient intake. That is now longer true. Today the selection pressure is towards those who have some variation in behavior or biochemistry that stops or slows the drive to consume as much high energy food as possible. Hobhouse has little or no understanding of evolutionary processes.I do agree with his assessment of the importance of quinine and feel the work on that segment relating sylvichemicals to social change is the best section. His text on the rum, sugar, slave triangle is not as well based. It was perhaps far to large a subject to be merely a segment so suffered from over simplification. He spent far more time on social ans economic dynamics that appeal to a botanist and far to little to support any real evaluation of the actual social and economic pressures. This section fails by falling into the gap between two ends Hobhouse was torn between. He should have stayed with the botanical evidence. The resulting book wavers and is vague on some things while being prejudicial on other counts.The concept is good and begins better than it ends."
16,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659947-marlene,5,"If you enjoyed Jared Dimond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel""--particularly the early chapters which deal with the influence of plant and animal life on the rise of civilization--you will probably find much to recommend this book, which explores the causative role of six plants on history. The plants chosen are quinine, sugar, tea, cotton, potatoes, and coca although many other candidates come readily to mind, e.g., pepper, nutmeg, soy, tulips, orchids.The author' style is engaging and informative, and he includes several extended digressions which are particularly appealing. For example, the section on potatoes contains a discussion of the pros and cons of free trade, and the portion on coca contains a history of the Coca-Cola company and the likely contents of the earliest versions of that drink. He also injects some pertinent open-ended questions--the ""what-if's"" of history--which are quite thought-provoking. If we are indeed in a period of climatic change--and I believe we are--the effects on plant life may offer some of the earliest and most profound evidence; history from this perspective may be more important than ever. Note: My copy of this book is a slipcased Folio Society reprint of the 1999 edition which has been updated by the author. It has a beautiful cover, quality paper, and a pleasing heft to it. If you appreciate books as ""things,"" this one is a treat. Also, it was not filled with the increasingly common and annoying typographical errors that have become so common; I didn't notice even one! "
17,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934422-a,1,"what I learned from this book: That once again, bad science trumps actual science, and that books filled with bad science also don't actually have characters. Oh wait, I already knew that.Um, um, um ok. Right. So, there's this other earth right and it exists in the same space as our earth right but in a different time so um um and ok then there's an accident and the people learn to come through from earth to earth and like um its really exciting and um um um and then they have to come from earth to earth by KILLING PEOPLE with RADIATION and its really scary and all these people die and there's this dude named Snow Wolf and he's kind of scary and mean but he's a hero right and saves people and then there are these two guys from other-earth and they're named Vpaad and Barry, (Barry? Seriously?) but then they die and then smart scientists use photon pressure to separate the two earths and everyone lives happily ever after except for all the people on the over-populated other-earth and all the people in all the cities that they destroyed in their war like New York and Philadelphia and Chicago the end.Even by crappy sci-fi standards this book was truly awful. Don't read it. Please, save yourself."

Maybe I am one of the ""politically correct"" or maybe I found no rational in his view of the death penalty or maybe I need to visit Singapore and find this crime free society. Where on earth does he think huge amounts of laundered monies end up? However, there are some excellent passages on how man has used his fellow man to the point of near extermination to produce wealth. It is a pity that this otherwise impressive book is littered with aspects and subsections that are a bit off the point. Also, some of the broadsides at particular ethnic groups might be the writer's views but they are still offensive in the extreme. "

Would make a great debate.I had just read The Miraculous Fever Tree, and this book confired all that was written by the authoress on quinine. Sugar expanded my knowledge of the slave trade. Tea involved in the opium wars, now I ever knew that. Cotton, potaotes and the most destructive of our time coca, a very informative book that was first published in 1985 and the author has stated that in this new addition ""....it is even more gratifying if no amendment has to be made because of new evidence"", but he has added Coca."
20,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1204807-chandra,2,"A similar vein as 'Botany of Desire,' but not quite as enjoyable of a read. Hobhouse has clearly done some deep digging for the historical info he provides, but unfortunately doesn't cite very much of it. That missing tidbit, coupled with his sweeping generalizations and unfounded claims from time to time, leave a bit to be desired. I'm not sure I buy his hypotheses about how these six particular plants changed the world (and all the 'this extremely historical event would have never happened without this plant' claims), but he provides some neat historical facts, especially about the Incan society, that I found interesting. Doesn't come with a resounding recommendation though."
21,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10687402-m,3,"Hobhouse presents a fascinating perspective on the role of these plants in human history. The connections he makes between sugar, quinine, and slavery are especially compelling. He shows that plants to which addictions are formed, including opium and even sugar, are central in shaping our culture. Although this is a little dry as an end-of-the-day relaxation, I even found the footnotes to be of interest and read them as end-of-chapter blocks.I'm interested to see what Hobhouse has to say about cocoa in what appears to be a revised edition of this book."

I was so interested that kept a note of the name of the book and went immediately to the school bookshop to order a copy. My 15 year old self really enjoyed the book.

23,1593760493,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838561-jean,3,"Hobhouse argues that five plants (quinine, potato, sugar cane, cotton and tea) have influenced the course of history more than men. The scholarly book was thoroughly researched and includes pages of footnotes at the end of each chapter.
