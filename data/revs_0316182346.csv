0,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"I really like books on neurology. I like to know how our our behaviour changes when something goes wrong. I am a lot less interested in the normal working of the brain. I just can't get excited about glia, synapses, astrocytes and all the other bits that are of interest to neurologists. It is the telling of anecdotes about people that illustrate disorders, malfunctioning and occasionally extraordinary abilities and talents that I relate to. I recently read Oliver Sacks Hallucinations and VS Ramchandran's Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind and I was hoping for something more in that vein. But there were too few anecdotes and too much glia in the book for me. I didn't like the writing. I am not keen on slang being used to entertain, it just strikes me as loose writing. The chapters I read had mostly centuries-old anecdotes - Philippe of France - and were told in a very loose way. It didn't engage me. Then on to the dreaded glia and the author's absolute delight in the structure of the brain that I do not share.I would say I'd given this book up as it never engaged me. But it has an average of over 4, so perhaps I'll just put it to one side for now and come back to it.... sometime soon.I never know what to do with books I don't like that everyone else does. Whether to persist with them or just give them up? I always feel that I am missing something crucial. What about you?"

Sam Kean writing about brains leads, perhaps unsurprisingly, to a fascinating (and sometimes funny) book.Part of the reason brains are so fascinating is that they operate with such prodigious levels of speed and processing power that even the most powerful supercomputers can’t replicate everything that they do (they also look kind of like something Scots would boil in a sheep’s stomach with neeps and tatties, so they’ve got that going for them). And, yet, we still don’t fully understand how the brain works, and much of what we do know is the result not of studying fully functioning, normal brains, but, rather, examining those unfortunate individuals whose brains have been damaged as a result of traumatic injury or illness, resulting in bizarre behavior ranging from extreme personality changes to an inability to identify vegetables—and only vegetables (this latter brain deficiency seems particularly useful to me, actually, as it would make it much easier to continue my lifelong quest to consume as few vegetables as possible).Kean’s narrative highlights some of the most famous damaged brains in history, individuals whose conditions facilitated leaps and bounds forward in neuroscience and in helping us not only understand how our brains work, but how to treat those whose brains maybe don’t work quite right. A word of warning: it can be terrifying to read about people whose faculties have been so irrevocably altered by brain trauma that they can no longer recognize loved ones or become convinced that every single person on the planet has been replaced by clones (due to the fact that they can no longer recognize the same person if they look in any way different from the last time they saw them—a change out outfit, a haircut, even an eyebrow plucking can throw them off), and there’s a distinct chance that you will want to walk around wearing a brain-protecting helmet at all times afterward (or maybe that’s just me). I now live in fear of getting a railroad spike through my brain and going all Phineas Gage on everyone.That said, this book will delight pop science aficionados (or fans of Kean’s other works) and leave you even more awed that the same organ responsible for my fixation with Saved by the Bell (which, in and of itself, may be a form of brain damage) can perform such an immense array of complicated tasks and, in certain circumstances, rewire itself to keep functioning even after sustaining trauma. We’ll call this a strong 4.5 stars.(Personally, I look forward to seeing…or, well, I guess not seeing…what happens when scientists get their hands on my brain. It will either advance neuroscience by leaps and bounds or set us back a thousand years. My money is on the latter.)"
2,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is the fourth book I've read by Sam Kean, and they have all been excellent. This fascinating book describes the history of our understanding of the brain in the last couple hundred years. It is not a comprehensive treatment, but instead it is an in-depth look at a number of episodes that gave quantum jumps into our understanding. Often, these episodes are centered on some type of brain injury or illness.One of the central questions about the brain is whether or not thought processes are decentralized or localized. That is to say, the question is whether each type of thought process is localized in a specific area of the brain, or spread throughout the brain. Nowadays, we know that specific areas of the brain are responsible for specific thought processes, but it took a long time for sufficient evidence to pin this down with proof. The best proof was to have a specific area of the brain damaged by illness or injury, and to observe what types of thought processes were affected.One of the most famous of these was the case of the rail supervisor Phineas Gage, who had a metal bar run through his skull and brain. Now, I have read about this case numerous times, in many different books. But Sam Kean's description is more detailed than any other that I have read.Interestingly, Kean takes the reader through the history of two presidential assassinations; McKinley and Garfield. In both cases, the assassins were normal men with no violence in their past. But over a short period of time, the assassins became mad, and autopsies gave physical evidence (macroscopic in one case, microscopic in the other) that the assassins had damage to their brains.The book is essentially a collection of anecdotal episodes. This made it very engaging, without going too deeply into jargon and technical detail. I was captivated by the description of the rare Capgras syndrome. A victim of this syndrome can see and recognize family members. But, as a result of two separate lesions in two different areas of the brain, the victim believes that despite recognizing the appearance of people he sees, he believes irrationally that they are not his family members, but are imposters!I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Henry Leyva. His narration is very good, and helped me to enjoy the book."
3,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Kean’s third popular science book tells fascinating stories about how the brain works. “Tiny flaws in the brain [have] strange but telling consequences all the time,” he writes. King Henri II incurred brain injuries in jousting accidents and suffered headaches and seizures. The rival neurosurgeons of the title examined him but found no skull fractures. Yet Henri died of an intracranial hemorrhage – proof the brain could be damaged even if the skull stayed intact.The book is crammed full of such intriguing anecdotes. Kean profiles presidential assassins with brain decay, a blind Royal Navy lieutenant who travelled the world using his cane for echolocation, and an American Civil War veteran whose story sparked research on phantom limbs. Seemingly minute brain changes can alter personality or cause epilepsy, amnesia, dwarfism, degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s or kuru (once common among Papuan cannibals), and all manner of delusional behavior. Kean systematically chronicles how neuroscience came to understand which parts of the brain control which functions. His clear, humorous prose is perfectly pitched, with simple diagrams, photographs and rebuses enlivening each chapter.As a light-hearted collection of scientific yarns, this is very much in the vein of Bill Bryson or Oliver Sacks. However, there is a serious message here, too: the brain’s ability to repair itself is reassuring, but memory and identity prove problematic: “Our memories actually sculpt, rework and...distort” events, Kean cautions. If the brain is so changeable, does the self remain the same? Enthralling, thought-provoking reading.Related reads:

4,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"This book is a delightful tour around the brain with a knowledgeable and gently humorous guide who never loses focus but is quite prepared to be diverted if there is a chance to enrich the story.The dueling neurosurgeons of the title represent both Paré and Vesalius (the founder of modern anatomy) who were called upon in 1559 to treat King Henri of France who, while jousting, had suffered a penetrating wound to his eye and brain. Thankfully we have now in pathology more sophisticated tests for examining tissue than what was used by the royal surgeon Paré: “He developed tests to distinguish between fat… and oozing bits of fatty brain tissue (fat floats on water, brain sinks; fat liquefies in a frying pan, brain shrivels.)” And we have more sophisticated treatments now too, than the potion of rhubarb and charred Egyptian mummy force-fed to poor Henri. The famous surgeons didn’t manage to save the King, and together they performed his autopsy; the briefly described procedure is quite similar to modern day technique. They did deviate from the usual procedure in that this time they didn’t lop the head off to remove the brain. We don’t do that either nowadays in the autopsy suite.The book is populated with famous characters from the annals of medical history. They’re all here: Vesalius, Cajal, Golgi, Broca, HM, Penfield, etc., but they are not dusty relics in a history museum. They come alive because Kean describes not just their feats but how their actions propelled forward various concepts and understandings of anatomy and medicine, based on case histories that are vividly and engagingly described. While his tone is frequently light and humorous, he nonetheless stays within bounds and always respects the humanity of the patients. The evolution of medical thinking is illustrated with these fascinating stories. He has achieved the ideal pop science narrative that seamlessly marries case histories to fundamental neurological concepts.(Received as ARC via NetGalley from Little, Brown & Co.)"
5,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35080485-hayden-houck,5,"The tale of the dueling neurosurgeons  This book interests me a lot. I am very interested in most things science, especially neuroscience. I read the book The Female Brain, and my mom was talking to a friend about that. Her friend gave me this book to read.  I'm so glad she did. I love reading things that have to do with science and that have random little fun facts that you can tell to your friends or family. It had a lot of short stories about a ton of cases and some of them are really strange. One is about blind people that learned to see through sensors attached to their tongues. Another was about a traveler that visited hundreds of different places, explored new countries and climbed mountains. He was also blind. He used a cane for echolocation and made his way around the world. He walked, in total, over the distance from the earth to the moon.  Stories like these are my favorite, because they should be impossible. A blind man exploring the world? No way. People seeing through their tongues? Yeah right, like they have eyes there. People whose eyes skip over stationary things completely, but only register moving objects? Completely impossible, you say. But no, it's all here, right here in this book that you should have in your hands. I would recommend this to everyone that likes reading. You could hate anything related to neuroscience but love this book and hear yourself talking about it every chance you get. "
6,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,3,"The title suggests an anecdotal romp propelled by Kean's chirpy narrative voice. However, these props are actually designed to lure the reader's entry into a much more serious domain. Kean's book is arranged as a survey of neuroanatomy. Five broad sections are broken up into individual chapters that each highlight a particular structure: Neurons, the occipital lobe (a key element in visual recognition), the cerebellum (part of a system that modulates motor control), the corpus callosum (the connection between left and right brain hemispheres), and the hippocampus (a critical componenet of memory storage). Some of his descriptions are unforgettable. Explaining the relationship between the motor cortex and the sensory cortex he writes:  “To execute a complicated movement, the motor areas also need feedback from the muscles at each stage, to ensure that their commands have been carried out properly. Much of this feedback is provided by the somatosensory cortex, the brain's tactile center. You can think about the somatosensory cortex as the motor cortex's twin. Like the motor cortex, it's a thin, vertical strip; they in fact lie right next to each other in the brain, like parallel pieces of bacon. Both strips are also organized the same way, body part by body part; that is, each strip has a hand region, a leg region, a lips region, and so on. In effect, then, the motor cortex and somatosensory cortex each contain a 'body map,' with each body part having its own territory. (p.145) Thanks – I guess, Sam. I'll never be able to think of bacon in the the same way now!The brain's localized areas are identified, not to introduce a new phrenology, but to identify the components of complex feedback circuits. Kean's explanation of visual recognition is particularly successful in demonstrating this point (Chapter 4). The tour starts in the occipital lobe. Specific neurons are excited by perceiving lines and their specific orientation:  “...the brain determinedly breaks … form down into tiny line segments.” (p.111) An even greater array of neurons are excited when they detect movement. The evolutionary advantage of such a faculty is obvious. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel shared the Nobel prize in 1981 for their discovery of this visual mechanism. But this is only the beginning. How do we recognize specific objects from this sensory data? How do we remember the categories these objects fall into (e.g. food vs. non-food)? More specifically, how do we recognize faces? Finally, how do we match specific entities to emotional responses? Kean outlines the theory that two major circuits for visual data processing exist. The first circuit is a basic identifier: Where is the object located and how fast is it moving? The circuit includes flow from the occipital lobes to the parietal lobes. The second circuit flows from the occipital lobes to the temporal lobes where information about memory and recognition are transmitted. As for identifying faces, there is an area called the fusiform facial area dedicated specifically to this task.Kean illustrates his examples with cases of brain damage and the resulting inferences. We learn about C.K. who suffered damage that made him unable to distinguish between food and non-food. Despite superior scores on face recognition tests, he was also unable to recognize faces presented to him upside down. We learn about Elliott who, after prefrontal lobe surgery, was unable to make decisions, despite the fact that his memory, language and learning skills were unimpaired. Antonio Damasio believes the key to Elliot's indecision was the impairment of limbic system connections that link emotion to decision making. The most poignant example is that of Clive Wearing, who suffered loss of even short-term memory, which Kean characterizes as the loss of moment-to-moment consciousness. Again, scientists surmise some sort of disruption of the limbic system. They just don't know what.Kean's historical approach serves to highlight the difficulty of neuroscience exploration. Much of this knowledge was gained through means that would be deemed unethical. Neurosurgery was dangerous, and surgeons often performed procedures with little hope for a positive outcome. It also calls into question the idea of “informed consent.” If a patient has neurological damage, how “informed” can his consent be? The animal experiments Kean describes are frequently revolting. I have read several previous books that have touched on neuroscience. I found Kean's book a pleasant combination of familiar material and an easily digestible introduction to broad neurocircuits. Kean obviously hopes the casual reader will find his curiosity piqued and will explore more specialized works on the workings of the brain. My personal preference is to start with the small and specific. Readers of books like Lisa Genova's LEFT NEGLECTED, or Jill Bolte Taylor's MY STROKE OF INSIGHT, might find this book of special interest as a logical steppingstone."
7,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,4,"This book is structured by alternating anecdotes and then science, anecdotes then science, etc. It helped break up the technical info so it wasn't so overwhelming to a reader like me. And I love a good science story.The brain is a fascinating thing. How did Phineas Gage survive a metal rod through his brain? It bypassed vital regions and flew out the other side. But the author doesn't want us to think the brain is totally localized for certain functions - we use our entire brain in subtle ways for our actions. There may be spots that are specialized for sight but we need the whole thing to ""really"" see. Phineas Gage survived and had a somewhat normal life but as his contemporaries said, he never again was Phineas Gage."
8,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44520192-daisy,4,"[Wasn't a huge fan of the way the author seemed to humanise convicted pedophile Gajdusek, though. I'll go into more "
9,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/966131-wendi,4,"Fascinating! This entire book was just endlessly fascinating to me. It's all about how traumatic insults to the skull and brain, whether by physical force or insidious viruses, affect our physical abilities and thoughts.Kean expertly weaves storytelling about particular brain trauma patients with carefully explained science. I knew of a few of the conditions discussed, but certainly not in the detail Kean devotes. He explains the process of how damage occurs and then why that damage can cause conditions like kuru disease, phantom limbs, aphasia, hallucinations. He even touches on the history of scientists and doctors attempting to local the home of the soul in the brain.Kean opens each section with the story of a particular person (or group of people) who has experienced an injury to the brain, and then explains how the doctors of the time attempted to help that victim with their contemporary knowledge. Each story is like a mini-mystery; you receive just enough information to understand the situation and then want to keep reading in order to solve/understand the process along with the doctors or scientists. I don't want to give them all away, but one example is how the cannibals in Papua, New Guinea were felled by kuru; in the end it wasn't because they cannibalized their dead (""eating brains isn't inherently deadly"") but rather but rather ""the bad luck of eating patient zero."" Kean explains why even people born without limbs can experience phantoms, blind people will still respond to smiles or scowls or yawns without even understanding why, how reading changes our brain, why some victims of brain damage can write perfectly well but cannot read (not even the sentence they just wrote), that brains vary from person to person as much as faces do, and how a set of (still living) twins share a conjoined brain and so can do things like taste what's in one another's mouths and yet retain distinct individual thoughts and preferences.Witty, informative, a bit scary. To consider how vulnerable and yet also how resilient our brains are, is just fascinating."
10,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’d been eyeing this for a while, but Robert really convinced me to read it. I was worried with that title it would be a bit too silly, but I shouldn’t have worried. The tone can be light, and there are a few jokes cracked and some wry asides, but it’s more scientific than the title suggests, while still being accessible to the general reader. A lot of the cases it discusses were ones I was already aware of, but it added depth and colour. I really need to get round to reading Permanent Present Tense, a book about “H.M.”, or Henry Molaison, which I’ve already got, and I’m curious about Clive Wearing’s wife’s book about his condition (though this youtube video gives you some idea).It also added information about scientists who’ve studied the brain, though I kept muddling up my timelines and getting confused about who discovered what and when, and how it impacted everyone else. It’s arranged more thematically than chronologically, although there is a certain chronological element too (throughout the book, it moves toward more recent incidents and discoveries), so the timeline doesn’t matter incredibly.Altogether, I found it a good primer on the science and history of neurology, for a casual reader, and the notes and such at the back offer plenty more places to dig for interesting information. (Where the library has any of these rather specialised books might be another matter, alas.) Best of all, it never feels like a lecture: the tone is warm, and the author finds the best in people and theories rather than mocking previous insights that turned out to be wrong. Which is wise, since we don’t understand the brain yet, and all of this may yet be overturned again…Originally posted on my blog here!"
11,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I loved this.Like The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, Sam Kean uses anecdotes and humor to share scientific discoveries that shaped our knowledge of how things work. This book was longer and more detailed, but also more relevant to my field since the focus was on neuroscience.Though lighter in tone than the works of Oliver Sacks, this book similarly contained many fascinating tales of neurological damage and its idiosyncratic effects. It also asked a number of profound questions about the age-old mind/body problem and whether we truly have free choice given increasing evidence that our personalities and practically everything we do can be located in our neurology.While it helps to have a preexisting interest in the topic, I'm betting that even people who don't think they're interested in the brain could get into this book (hey, it happened to me with the periodic table when I read The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements)."
12,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,What a wonderful book! Shouldn't have waited so long to read it. 
13,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7383084-adam,4,"Two of the most interesting, engaging, and informative science books I've ever read were published in the last five years and written by the same person: Sam Kean. The first of these books, The Disappearing Spoon, is a history of the varied elements that make up the Periodic Table, which hangs in every American science classroom and is almost Borgesian in its functionality as both a serious emblem of scientific discovery and a series of 118 doorways that open to reveal 118 separate stories. Kean's second book, The Violinist's Thumb, was a similarly anthological collection of ""lost tales,"" each demonstrating the ways in which our genes have made us into the people we are today. What makes both books so successful, not just as narrative pieces but also works of enlightenment, is Kean's unyielding belief in the people behind these stories. Rather than numb his readers with facts, figures, dates, and academic jargon, Kean distills the most important discoveries of our lifetime--not to mention the last few centuries--into stories of love, death, obsession, resilience, success, failure, and redemption. In some instances, his subjects are unlikely heroes; in others, their genius is tempered by arrogance, jealousy, or even bigotry. But they are human, and the very same men and women who discovered the microscopic bits that make up our universe, our world, and ourselves--the billions of tiny puzzle-pieces that fit together with such impossible precision to make the Everything around and inside us--also allow us to discover them through their work. And in Kean's mind, these two otherwise isolated bodies--the scientist and their science--are inextricably linked and, without one another, incomplete.With The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons, Kean has taken on another difficult and long mysterious subject, the human brain...or, as he himself writes, the ""electrified tapioca"" nestled so precariously in the thick lockbox of bone atop our necks. It is the most important organ we possess--the Everest in the atlas of our bodies--and it is unique among the brains of all other creatures in that it is aware of itself, its functions, and its limitations. The human mind questions the universe and our place in it, ponders the existence of a Higher Power (or lack thereof), debates existential quandaries that are forever unsolvable, and struggles with emotions that even its millions of firing neurons cannot understand, though it expends quite a lot of its energy in pursuit of an answer all the same. And yet, for all its powers, we know so little about it that conflicts and disagreements among the most eminent of experts rage to this day, despite centuries of study. Even with the advent of advanced technology, those three gelatinous pounds remain mystifying, and ironically so: the very organ we use to decode the world around us is incapable of decoding itself.It's in this rich, frustrating, and seemingly fruitless pursuit that Kean finds his stories. Much like his previous books, an outwardly simple scientific task--a cataloging of the world's elements, an analysis of human genetics, and now a study of the human brain--becomes a monumental exercise in patience, dedication, endurance and, frequently, pure dumb luck. The two most unforgettable stories--and for completely different reasons--involve scientists who found themselves in tropical locations thousands of miles from home. The first is story of Carleton Gajdusek, a bombastic and headstrong man who took up residence in the Southern Pacific to study kuru, a degenerative neurological disorder that was devastating an isolated tribe in New Guinea. Earning the trust of the locals, he was able to gather brain and tissue samples from their dead, which he then had to ship back to laboratories throughout the world without a reliable postal service or the assistance of refrigerated transport; by the time he returned stateside, he had gathered enough raw data and materials to diagnose the cause of the tribe's problems. Unfortunately, his return--with quite a few of the island's boys over a number of years--also marked the end of his career, as his sexual predilection for those same boys became known. Gajdusek would die in exile after spending a year in prison, his legacy ruined--a Nobel Prize forgotten--and his otherwise monumental research forever tarnished by his actions. Similarly, the disease he had dedicated much of his life to unraveling and even curing, known as the ""laughing disease,"" ended on its own when the locals stopped consuming the brains of their recently deceased tribespeople.The second story concerns two British soldiers during World War II who also happened to be doctors. Captured by Japanese soldiers and mercilessly starved, they watched as their fellow POWs fell victim to an epidemic of beriberi, which they documented in great detail for months on end but were unable to stop. When it became clear that their research would be confiscated and likely destroyed by their captors, the two men sealed their papers in a tin and buried everything, unsure if they would even survive to see their hypotheses tested. Luckily, both of them did, and their research was retrieved with literally minutes to spare.*In both instances, the scientists involved found themselves in extreme conditions, noticed a devastating health problem, and used whatever they had on hand--makeshift surgical instruments, a cooler, scraps of paper, a tin, and their knowledge of the human body--to work towards a solution, not just to save lives, but to advance science itself. Many of the other stories featured in Kean's book work the same way. In one chapter, a famous neurosurgeon bribes a priest so that his assistant can cut out the glands of a dead man hours before he is to be buried; described as ""an illiterate wagon-driver,"" the man--John Turner--suffered from giantism, and the neurosurgeon is certain the cause is located in his glands. But as the assistant finishes removing the pituitary, the deceased's family breaks down the funeral-parlor door, forcing the young assistant to flee into a waiting taxicab. In another, an epileptic known only as H.M. has pieces of his brain sucked out with a tube; the procedure cures him of almost all seizures but leaves him with almost no memories. In fact, his brain becomes such a mysterious and important part of neuroscience that, after he passes away at age 82, it is removed from his skull, frozen, sliced into more than two thousand micro-thin slices, and scanned at extreme magnification for digital study.I write of these men and their patients in present tense, not only because they are the subjects of narrative nonfiction, but because their work--or, conversely, their ailments--are with us today. They inform modern science in ways that theories, anecdotal tales, and small-animal experimentation never could. Which is the tragedy that underlies much of Kean's book: in order for us to understand the brain as much as we do today, many people--men, women, and children equally--had to suffer. Some of them were unfazed by their ordeals, or they learned to live with what had happened to them, but most experienced pain and misery, if not total loss of life, and because of their own bodies no less. When neurosurgeons today speak of the advancements that have been made and the knowledge that has been gained, they speak of countless patients--dozens, maybe even hundreds of ordinary people--whose lives were unexpectedly interrupted, their bodies and minds forever unfixable. The pursuit of knowledge often claims its fair share of victims--Marie Curie is perhaps the most recognized example of this--but very few areas of science have claimed more than neurosurgery. And still, despite all this, we know very little. Those who taught us through their suffering did so in the beach-waters of an ocean that, even today, seems unimaginable in its breadth and depth. The horizon, unfortunately, is so very far away.*One of the men--Hugh de Wardener--lived long enough to be interviewed by Kean himself for this book. De Wardener passed away in late 2013 at the age of 97.This review was originally published at There Will Be Books Galore."
14,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"Kean has made another very entertaining book on a science field by telling entertaining stories involving the pioneers of that field. You will learn the basics of neuroscience but along the way you will meet two mad presidential assassins, WWI vets, Three presidents, ordinary people and some interesting neuroscientists. Some of the stories are quirky and strange some are funny and many are tragic. The story of this field is full of interesting characters and good storytelling and you will learn about the brain along the way."
15,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"There is little to say about this book, because it is simply so brilliant. Kean has successfully melded legitimate science with entertaining history, and a touch of historic drama too. His prose is a perfect mix of easy to understand (except for his pictograms, but don't worry) technicality and almost irreverent language which adds to the entertainment."
16,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55422230-amanja,5,"Author Sam Kean does a wonderful job in this book weaving together human interest stories and historical accounts with complex neuroscience to educate the reader without ever being boring, unapproachable, or condescending. I love this approach to nonfiction writing. It is so much easier to retain the facts when they’re couched in entertaining tales of wild accidents and spontaneous personality changes.There were countless times during this book that I felt the urge to stop and tell someone what I had just learned. For instance, that a person with a specific brain abnormality can lose the ability to read but retain the ability to write. So I wouldn’t be able to read this book I’m reviewing but I could write this sentence, and then not be able to read it right after!I highly recommend this book to anyone who’s had a slump of nonfiction. They can be fun and this one is proof!for more reviews and content please visit my new blog amanjareads.com"

Though the author does weave the narratives of subjects introduced in the first half back into the second half.- The “dueling neurosurgeons” of the title seems to represent about a dozen different neurosurgeons. This felt weird, but maybe others interpreted the title in a different way.- I am not 100% sure what his primary argument is, there seems to be too many vying for top tier.- Sometimes the approachable, layperson language was overly simplistic (this coming from someone whose graduate studies have been firmly within the liberal arts world) Overall, an interesting and explanatory read about what we know (and don’t know) about the human brain. 4/5*"

I found it incredibly fascinating. I've been unofficially studying everything on brain research that I can find for years now. I love where psychology and neuroscience collide. If I could have five careers in my life time a research neuroscientist would definitely be on that list. I will definitely be rereading this at some point.

20,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2278428-robert,5,"You can also find my review of The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons on my book blogThe Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons is a slightly misleading title: there is not a single incident of dueling neurosurgeons in the book.As a non-fiction, popular science primer on neuroscience, however, the books is splendid. I've heard quite a few of the anecdotes / case studies before, but this book pulls together all the incidents and anecdotes that have shaped neuroscience, and presented them in an engaging, fun way. It's a ""Horrible Histories"" book for adults, in some ways. The book is not too bothered about chronological order; instead, it presents the knowledge obtained thus far by brain region and by type of brain functionality. This works very well - but it does give a somewhat more logical and structured impression than the history of neuroscience and its theories probably warrants. And there's always the sense that bigger, clearer discoveries might be just around the corner...Many of the scenarios do resonate with me as a reader & movie watcher: clearly, the likes of Hitchcock and Philip K Dick were inspired very much by real conditions - and the effectiveness of uncanny stories is directly linked to how closely they resemble everyday (or not-so-everyday) brain misfirings...I'd highly recommend this book to anyone - it is a compelling, entertaining and educational read: pop science as it should be done."
21,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5271330-maree-kimberley,2,"I do feel a bit mean giving this 2 stars, but seeing as Goodreads won't give half stars I'll stick with it.I love reading books about neuroscience, and I've read quite a few. For me, Kean's Tale of Dueling Neurosurgeons wasn't all that great compared to others I've read (including the obscure but fascinating Postcards from the Brain Museum).Kean's writing is quite entertaining, and he did shed light on cases I hadn't heard about before. I was also interested in his myth-busting around the case of Phineas Gage. But one thing that drove me crazy was he continually referred to scientists/doctors who studied or treated brain injuries from the middle ages to early 20th century as ""neuroscientists"". The thing is, the term ""neuroscience"" wasn't actually coined until 1962 (by Francis O. Schmitt). I know this probably wouldn't annoy most readers, but for me it grated all the way through the book, and did diminish my reading experience.I also found the ending quite weak. It was almost like Kean ran out of steam and wasn't sure how to finish the book. Overall, though, it's a book that people who are curious about brain trauma/injury and brain diseases will find interesting, and it's an easy book to digest. But for my money, there are far better books about the brain out there. "
22,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"This was Really fascinating. Kean goes through the history of advances in the scientific understanding of how the human brain works through a series of stories, starting with the damaged brain of Henri II of France, in 1559, and ending with brain science from the early 2000's. He starts with basic brain structure and operation and goes all the way through science exploring mind/brain issues and consciousness. I actually listened to this as an audio book, so I missed out on the diagrams, which I'm sure would have added to my understanding, but even so his descriptions were very clear. A bit too clear, at a few points! The descriptions of brain surgery are sometimes excruciatingly graphic. For the most part, Kean's conversational, humorous style is very agreeable -- he talks about science in a way that a non-scientist can enjoy -- but occasionally his lighthearted tone struck me as a bit crass in the face of the suffering he is describing, and I could have done with a bit less salacious detail about certain side effects of brain malfunctions. Still, those are minor complaints, and I recommend this highly for readers interested in a popular history of brain science. "
23,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"Sam Kean has become my favorite, currently active, science author/interpreter. In this book, he sorts and distills scientific literature about neurological disorders, brain injuries, and illnesses that impact the brain into the parts of the brain most impacted and the stories they generate. Kean then tells the stories of the affected person, the scientists who interact with the patients, interactions with the family and community, and the significance to the understanding of brain functioning. At the beginning of each chapter, Kean has a puzzle, a rebus, to highlight the part of the brain that is the theme of his stories. He invites readers to email him if they solve all thirteen puzzles or if they need a clue. I will probably write to say I solved all thirteen. "
24,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22988415-ruhshan-ahmed,5,"Most of the time, we are unaware of what our brain doing. Most of our life, we are unaware of what our brain capable of. Most of us, are unaware of how horrible life would be if things go south inside the brain. Some of us, who finished reading the book have experienced in a fascinating fashion the progression of neuroscience through centuries, where heroes[as well as villains] are the neurosurgeons themselves! Every chapter made me wanted to touch my own brain, and thank it for a lot of thing.....  "
25,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109068-susanna---censored-by-goodreads,4,"Another excellent science book from Sam Kean; this one looks at how we learn about the brain and how it works mostly from when things go wrong. Looks at cases ranging from Henri II of France (bashed in the head by a broken tournament lance in 1559) to Phineas Gage (a railway iron went in through one eye socket, and then out the top of his head) and the sufferers from kuru (""the world's rarest disease"") in Papua New Guinea."
26,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14530641-holly-the-grimdragon,5,"To be useful, to enrich our lives, memory cannot simply record the world around us. It needs to filter, to discriminate. In fact, while we joke about a poor memory as a sieve, that's actually the wrong way around. Sieves let water leak through, but they catch substantial things -- they catch what we want to preserve. In the same way, a mind functions best when we let some things, like traumatic memories, go. All normal brains are sieves, and thank goodness for that.This was a fantastic random find at the library! My family & I were heading back up to the front desk, after having been in the kids area. I happened to turn around & there was a table set up with books & information. It was kismet, since I was about to read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat! This was the perfect companion read!It was immediately informative & engaging, easily relatable for the audience. I enjoyed the little touch Kean offers at the beginning of each chapter, a rebus to highlight the content discussed throughout.We find out at the start that the dueling neurosurgeons of the title were Ambroise Pare & Andreas Vesalius. Beginning with the story of King Henri II, of France. He dies from battle wounds that he sustained while jousting. Because Queen Catherine allowed the dueling neurosurgeons to perform an autopsy (incredibly rare at the time) they were able to determine that trauma to the brain alone, without damage to the skull, could be deadly. This was a landmark discovery. The autopsy also inspired Pare to write a book about head wounds, which was vital in the way neuroscience was operated for the following four centuries. There are intricate, engrossing accounts one after the other. I am probably going to come close to reaching the character limit on this review, because I loved this book so much! There is a lot to discuss. I will seriously be talking plenty of ears off about this book for the next little bit! Some of the tales I found most interesting were:Charles Guiteau, the assassin rejected from a government job. He caught syphilis from a hooker, which infected his brain. He claims God told him to kill President Garfield. ""He 'merely' shot Garfield, doctors killed him."" The God concept earned him an insanity plea from his brother-in-law lawyer, which fell through. Edward Charles Spitzka, who was a brain pathologist, pointed out neurological signs of trouble in Guiteau -- lazy eye, lopsided smile, lolling tongue. He was found guilty & sentenced to hanging. There was an autopsy performed shortly after, where he had the typical signs of a hanging victim -- rope burns, an erection (having ejaculated before dying.) His brain looked fairly normal. However, since the Pare/Vesalius era, autopsies had become more microscopic. Under closer examination, his brain was an absolute mess. Chronic disease, insane as Spitzka had expected. In retrospect, he had schizophrenia & add to that neurosyphilis, he became insane.Two decades after that (late 1800's) is when neuroscientists began making leaps in researching how brain cells work.There was an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated William McKinley. He was executed by the electric chair. His autopsy was performed by the son of Spitzka, who had completed the Guiteau autopsy! Czolgosz's brain looked normal when it was examined, however, it was never studied closer because a guard destroyed his remains, including his brain. Silas Weir Mitchell, a Civil War doctor, was the first to discover & name phantom limbs. Through his research, he estimated that 95% of his amputees experienced ghost limbs. He determined that the brain was the cause of this. That it must contain a hard-wired scaffold of the full body, especially since some patients born without limbs were able to feel phantoms. These days, it has been discovered that there aren't just phantom limbs -- there are also phantom teeth, hysterectomies can produce phantom menstrual cramps, even phantom penises & erections have been noted. In many cases, it is actually pleasurable for the man (!!!) Mitchell helped move the focus of phantom limbs to the brain, which was an immense step forward. He also studied medical history (wars benefiting medicine) & was a pioneer for the study on sleep paralysis, traumatic shock & object blindness.Robert Bartholow's patient, Mary Rafferty, was considered one of the most unethical experiments in medical history. He took advantage of her during this time & essentially zapped her brain to smithereens. The autopsy found inch deep needle tracks inside her brain. Of course, this outraged the medical community. His claim that she gave informed consent & the fact he was able to prove that the brain had specialized regions of function & could be probed with electricity, made him a pioneer in many ways. His career raged on, although it did set back neuroscience in many ways, because other scientists did not want to get involved in a Mary Rafferty situation.There is the story of Henry Gustav Molaison, who profoundly impacted neuroscience by revolutionizing memory. Dr. William Scoville operated on him by removing most of the hippocampus, along with other parts of the brain. ""Only a neurosurgeon could have destroyed them with such precision."" In a lot of ways, the surgery was successful. He was mostly seizure-free, his IQ increased, his personality remained unchanged. However, a decade of memories from before the operation were gone. Vanished. Also? He could not form new memories. Dr. Scoville had helped with Molaison's epilepsy, but he had sabotaged his memory at the same time. He was now suffering from amnesia. Wilder Penfield gets involved, sends a student named Brenda Milner to investigate Molaison's hippocampusless(ness), through her discovery, she ends up redefining what ""memory"" is. Before, neuroscientists thought of memory as monolithic, but Milner denounces this & brings forth two types: declarative & procedural. This now becomes the basis in all memory research.During this same case study, Milner found short-term memory. Something previously non-existent. After these discoveries, Molaison was a medical superstar. Phineas Gage is another famous name in neuroscience, although his story is more of legend & unfortunately not as much is known about him post-surgery. What is known is that his personality completely changed. For the worse. This was one of the first known cases where the personality was changed & the frontal lobe was the suspect.We don't see with the eyes. We see with the brain.This book is overflowing with content! Most of the scientists mentioned throughout the book have had brilliant careers, many Nobel Prize winners. It is so interesting to read not only about the patients, but also the scientists.Santiago Ramon y Cajal, Camillo Golgi, Paul Bach-y-Rita, Tatsuji Inouye, David Hubel & Torsten Wiesel, Captain George Dedlow, Carleton Gajdusek, Stanley Prusiner, James Wenceslaus Papez, Paul Bucy, Wilder Penfield, Paul Broca, Karl Wernicke, Roger Sperry & Harvey Cushing (I am sure I missed a few) were all integral in the field of neuroscience.Sam Kean writes about a myriad of neurological disorders: Phantom limbs, Synethesis (which scientists have only just begun to skim the surface of the various types), kuru (a disease of epidemic proportions that attacked only Fore people. It was transmitted through the tribe by cannibalism from the funeral feasts.) Slow viruses (kuru, human ""mad cow"" disease, scrapie.) Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, the limbic system, Kluver-Bucy syndrome, seizures, delusions, Capgras syndrome, Cotard syndrome, Korsakoff syndrome, alexia sine agraphia.I have always been amazed by what the brain can do (in part because I am a long-time migraine sufferer), but after reading this, I am in awe even more!Kean truly has a gift. Rather than have a dry, technical book, he made this incredibly fascinating. It was so interesting to read. I learned so much & had fun while doing it!Highly recommend for the nonfiction fans, the people interested in neuroscience or those who just enjoy engaged learning. 5 enthusiastic stars!"
27,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14992950-fawkes-phoenix,4,"This was a very interesting read. Essentially the book is broken up into different chapters based on different areas of the brain. The authors depicts what each area does by a mixture of story telling and info session - so it is part historical fiction/non-fiction and part lecture. Some of the stories are really neat - like the story about Henry 2nd and his jousting accident contributing to neuroscientist discovering concussions. There are also assassins, and remote tribes, plus crazy experiments and even crazier surgeons. I feel like this is a really interesting way to discuss a topic that could end up very dry and boring. The story telling alone is pretty neat, especially to hear about some of these crazy accidents or delve into the mind of psychopaths. Kean also talks about the different neuroscientists, discussing where they came from and how they began investigating the brain and finding these patients. Learning about the scientists helps elaborate on the science itself. It makes the studies much more interesting and you feel more involved in the discovery. Lastly, there is some textbook like material in the book, there has to be. I mean we can't have a book of neuroscience without actually discussing anatomy and physiology. So sometimes those parts can be a little slow, but lean always manages to bring the A&P around back to the story, the neurosurgeon or even pop culture. So if you're really interested in the brain, neuroscience and neurosurgery, this book is a must read. If you can't stand reading about neurons and axons though, this book might be a little too much for you. Its about 60-40: A&P to historical fiction/nonfiction. On top of all that, Sam Kean is a such a great writer. He really gets you into the information and makes it seem effortless instead of overly science-y and technical. He can add humor to some of the most humorless aspects of neuroscience, I mean the cerebellum isn't really that funny right? not so, with Kean. His subtle little witticisms really are great and help break up the monotony of the technical mumbo jumbo. Ultimately Id definitely read more books by Kean. "
28,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons: The History of the Human Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness and Recovery by Sam Kean""The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons"" is an excellent collection of stories in neuroscience. Best-selling author and gifted science writer, Sam Kean, provides readers with a real gem. Kean’s great eye for captivating stories about the brain and his expertise in retelling these stories end up helping the readers gain an understanding of how the brain works. This fascinating 377-page book is broken out into the following five parts: Part I. Gross Anatomy; Part II. Cells, Senses; Circuits Part III. Body and Brain; Part IV. Beliefs and Delusions; and Part V. Consciousness. Positives:1.	Science writing at its best. Kean is climbing the echelon of premier popular science authors.2.	Neuroscience is one of my favorite topics and thrilled that a gifted storyteller handled this book.3.	Great format and approach. Each chapter covers an intriguing story about how the brain works yet it flows beautifully as a whole.4.	Plenty of diagrams of parts of the brain and photos that complement this wonderful narrative.5.	Kean excels at keeping it real. He doesn’t oversell what we know and keeps the science well grounded in reality.6.	Wonderful gift of narration that includes a well weaved story based on history and good science.7.	Once again, the impact of religion on science rears its head. “In the early 1200s, the Catholic church had declared that no proper Christians, including physicians, could shed blood; physicians therefore looked down upon surgeons as butchers.”8.	Love how theories of neuroscience are introduced some are ultimately debunked and others have staying impact. “These findings led Cajal to propose the “neuron doctrine,” one of the most important discoveries ever in neuroscience. In brief, Cajal’s neurons were not continuous, but had tiny gaps between them. And they transmitted information in one direction only: from dendrite to cell body to axon.”9.	The analysis of famous assassins’ brains that lead to interesting discoveries.10.	Sometimes asking the right questions are as important as the answers. “Sorting out cause and effect is tricky with brain chemistry: does depression cause changes in brain chemicals, or do changes in brain chemicals cause depression? The street probably runs both ways. But the balance of evidence does suggest that loneliness, isolation, and a sense of helplessness can all deplete neurotransmitters—can poison the soup and sap vital ingredients.”11.	Interesting look at how neurons work. “Overall, just as a wagon wheel will carve a rut into the road after repeated journeys, repeated neuron firings will carve ruts into the brain that make signals much more likely to follow some neural tracks than others.”12.	How vision works. “In fact, our vision is so biased toward movement that we don’t technically see stationary objects at all. To see something stationary, our brains have to scribble our eyes very subtly over its surface. Experiments have even proved that if you artificially stabilize an image on the retina with a combination of special contact lenses and microelectronics, the image will vanish.”13.	A look at how the brain maps the body.14.	An interesting look at a number of interesting diseases involving the brain. “They proposed that kuru, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob—which all cause “spongiform” brain damage and can all lie dormant for long periods before roaring awake—were caused by a new class of microbes, which they dubbed ‘slow viruses.’”15.	Excellent examples of specific damages to the brain and its impact. “But around age ten she began suffering from Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare disorder that petrifies and kills amygdala cells. Within a few years she had two “black holes” where her amygdalae should have been. She hasn’t felt a lick of fear since.” 16.	Many revelations in this book, here is one of my favorites: “Temporal lobe lesions can flip people’s sexual orientations from gay to straight (or vice versa), or redirect their sexual appetites toward inappropriate things: common side effects of Klüver-Bucy include zoophilia, coprophilia, pedophilia, and -philias so idiosyncratic they don’t have names.”17.	A look at what happens when brain processes go awry. “Some delusions run so deep that they fray the very fabric of the victim’s universe. With so-called Alice in Wonderland syndrome—a side effect of migraines or seizures—space and time get warped in unsettling ways.”18.	The difference between Broca and Wernicke’s area. “Generally speaking, a broken Broca’s area knocks out speech production, while a wrecked Wernicke’s area impairs speech comprehension.”19.	By far the best retelling of the over told story of Phineas Gage (it’s practically in every book of popular neuroscience). He debunks some myths pertaining to this story, which I found to be quite refreshing.20.	Works cited and so much more…Negatives:1.	Very little not to like about this book. I would have added a timeline or a table of the greatest contributors of neuroscience as a nice additional bonus.2.	Kean stays away from controversial issues. There is very little on intelligence and as I recall nothing on gender differences. He touches upon social justice with regards to crime and punishment but I sense he holds back.3.	I loved the retelling of Phineas Gage’s story but I felt Kean could have done better with the topic of consciousness. In summary, what a fun way to learn about how the brain works; this is a beautifully written and well-researched book that is a joy to read. Fascinating stories about ordinary people who went through extraordinary circumstances and Kean retells their stories with mastery. A high recommendation! Get this book.Further suggestions: “The Disappearing Spoon” and “The Violinist’s Thumb” by the same author, “The Mind’s Eye” and “Hallucinations” by Oliver Sacks”, “Braintrust” by Patricia S.

29,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20668719-wendy-bunnell,3,"Interesting collection of case studies about people who suffered various brain injuries and lived long enough for doctors and scientists to learn about brain function by how the injuries had impacted their lives. The history of the study of brain function was interesting. Who knew how controversial it would be to think that different parts of the brain had different tasks? Reminded me of the big controversy between the scientists who thought the sun revolved around the earth, all sorts of political and religious implications, good grief.This reminded me of The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, only less dated. Could have been shorter by editing down some of the background, as it tended to drag a little, but I prefer fiction to non-fiction, so maybe non-fiction lovers expect level of detail and don't care about story pacing as much."

32,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This is an exceptional list of the most interesting brain deficits uncovered by neuroscientists / neurosurgeons from the time humans began studying the brain to the present. Kean managed to include the most exciting, disturbing, and thought -provoking examples neuroscience has to offer. I have found that it's very difficult to find an author who is both engaging and spot on with the science. It's extremely frustrating to invest time in a book on neuroscience only to find out fairly far into the book that the author actually doesn't know that much about the very subject of which they wrote an entire book. Kean knows his science and his way of relating each example rivals the best writers in neuroscience. This book will not introduce its readers to deep science (action potential, channels, biochem, etc) but it will still be fascinating to even those who have a lot of science under their belt. No prerequisites are needed for this book (you barely have to be curious to get sucked into this one- it will engage even the mildly curious) but the well studied scientist won't be bored. I have read about many of the studies included by Kean many times over, but they are so damned good, I was excited about this book from page one onward. Kean provides a rich history into the study of the brain, but you will never feel like you are reading a history. The cases of each individual are simply too interesting to realize you are actually learning. The whole book reads like story-time, but story time for those who care about accuracy. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. "
33,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45297035-taija,5,"Brilliant, brilliant author. His books should be required reading in school. Way more interesting than those textbooks. "
34,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147366-david-rush,3,"Well that was interesting!Interesting and I think I learned a lot, but there is the embarrassment of admitting to myself that I was having trouble remembering so much of a book that often dwell-ed on memory problems. And I had no excuse like part of by brain being scooped out of my skull. The good thing was this book is packed with fascinating medical/neurological crazy tales. The bad thing was there were so many that it was hard to keep track of them. Plus I think it was a little disjointed and maybe some sort of superstructure would have helped. Or maybe it was meant to be a survey course and that is just the way those sort of things work out. Still while I enjoyed it, I kept thinking it could be so much better.I want to remind myself of some of the cool stuff…The most common type of synesthesia (colors associated with sounds) produces a symphony of color…Franz Liszt used to berate his orchestra – who could only stare back bewildered – for playing his music the wrong color “Gentlemen, a little bluer please, the tone depends on it!” another time he implored: “That is a deep violet…Not so rose!” Pg. 84 All babies have far more neurons than they need:…as a result, young children probably experience synesthesia all the time… Pg. 86Temporal lobe lesions can flip people’s sexual orientation form gay to straight (or vice versa), or redirect sexual appetites toward inappropriate things. Pg. 204Then there is Capgras syndrome where loved ones are replaced by impostors even when they admit they look exactly like the “original”. Apparently the brain has a problem when looking at things it knows, but in a desperate attemp to explain this unease the brain explains it away as the person is an imposter.With Capgras, the sudden loss of emotional glow feels threatening and demands explanation, which is the left brain’s bailiwick. Pg 260But how about Cotord syndrome in which victims absolutely swear, that they’ve died, and no amount of common sense logic will change their minds.And the idea that human memory is like computer storage is, well...just wrong.Non declarative memory rely on the cerebellum …Episodic (personal) memories lean heavily on the hippocampus, while semantic (factual) memories utilize the parahippocampus to a much larger degree, Pg 290I’ve read elsewhere that remembering may actually be a creative activity, and that such things as eye witness testimony being usually unreliable. So this stuff feeds into that.This implies that our brains, when recalling a memory, probably don’t replay a pristine “master copy” each time. Instead, they might have to re-create and re-record the memory each time…this theory called reconsolidation… pg. 296 We don’t store our memories the way computer hardware does, with each datum in a well defined location. Human memories live in overlapping neuron circuits that can bleed together over time….Memories are memoirs not autobiographies. Pg 297I had a problem with the research from the days before brain scans. We have heard of mice and monkeys, but I didn’t realize cats got into these torture sessions. And it truly is torture.…(at Oxford)…where scientists had removed the upper brains of cats. The cats ate and slept and moved about just fine, but they’d become zombies – any sense of playfulness or personality vanished. Pg. 219Hubal and Wiesel in 1958 …strapping down an anesthetized cat into harness, immobilizing its eyes, and forcing it to stare at spots…the kitty had to lie on its back, staring straight up toward the ceiling.Final thoughts: A good start of something I hope to look into and remember more about...the brain, its parts and how they all work.Note to self: Remember this..Middle Brain/Limbic systemThalamusHypothalamusPituitary glandAmygdalaHippocampus"
35,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5233260-margie,4,"This is a hard book to review. Very interesting in how certain parts of the brain can react to injuries, and some personality changes that occur.

Perfect starting point if you don't know anything about the subject but wish to learn the basics principles of brain processes and gather a bunch of jaw-dropping anecdotes along the way. If you, like me, aren't new to neurosciences you will probably know most of the stories already, but Kean's style is so pleasant the repetition will not bother you that much.

37,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"It took me a while to finally get to this book and I don't know why, Sam Kean never fails to entertain.After tackling the periodic table in The Disappearing Spoon and DNA in The Violinist's Thumb, Kean dives into the human brain. And I don't mean ""dive"" in a figurative sense, I mean he describes doctor literally digging around in people's brains to figure out how they worked.Kean is a master and making science engaging. He educates about the brain and its functions by telling fascinating stories about science history. He talks about researchers and patients, and odd stories that will rattle around in my own brain (the limbic parts like the thalamus and hypothalamus, to be exact) for a long time. He talks about kings (King Henri II had a horrific lance accident and then underwent an unheard of royal autopsy), presidents (Woodrow Wilson's stroke in essence made his wife the first female acting president), and working men (Gage had a 3.5 foot metal spike enter beneath his eye and exit through the top of his head, and he stayed conscious through it all).It is amazing how the only way doctors used to be able to study the brain was after people got hurt—a knock on the head all the way up to a spear through the skull—when they mapped the injury and noted what physical damages the patient suffered. Some doctors even caused the damage themselves (mostly unintentionally) as they tried to do primitive neurosurgery. I admit that Kean may be more on the advanced end of the ""general public"" spectrum, but if you have any scientific curiosity and/or find details fascinating, then I cannot recommend his books highly enough."

The Blurb:From the author of the bestseller The Disappearing Spoon, tales of the brain and the history of neuroscience.  The Short of it: However you felt reading that lonnnnnng title? That’s how you’ll feel reading the book. It’s two parts interesting and one part can-you-hurry-it-up-already. The Rest of it: For the first 3/4ths of the book I found it completely fascinating and understandable. The tone is such that even someone with no knowledge of the brain could easily follow along, and the parts about how your brain changes (or doesn’t) to accommodate injury and illness is pretty amazing. The last couple chapters veer more into talking about the soul and consciousness, and the controversy that happened when researchers started to pinpoint areas of the brain the controlled specific actions and emotions and I felt like that part wasn’t quite as well done. This is likely because of the unscientific nature of the soul itself and so is understandable, if a bit boring. If I had a complaint about it it would be that I would have liked to see more of the interesting cases and less of the process of presenting the work and the background of the scientists themselves. (Tho to be fair, several of those were fascinating as well.) Overall, quite interesting and a nice break from my usual reading material. Source: NetGalley "
39,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47054186-seth-hanson,5,"The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons is an in depth account of the history of the development of our understanding of the human brain through the stories of those who have suffered brain damage and diseases and the scientists who treated and studied them. It starts during medieval France and, in sections about the different sections of the brain and and consciousness, and arranged within them in chronological order. It is about many different characters, in different times and places, and often has many different ones in the same chapters. It is also a book with many different conflicts, since each chapter is a story in itself. However, they are still interconnected and all come together to form a cohesive picture of the brain and the story of it's discovery and analysis from thousands of years ago to how we are still learning today.I really liked this book in part because it took a topic that otherwise might not have been as interesting and made it more so and also both easier to understand and more historically detailed. It was a different way to explain how something worked, by looking at how it was discovered and learned about, and it is a good one. One of the only things that I did not like about the book was that at times I felt that the author got too far off topic when he was explaining the background on something. Background knowledge is important, but I think it is also important to stay on the topic of that section."

It’s a history of how Neuroscience came to be what it is today. From jousting to dead friars healing the sick, the adventures in this book are humorous, amazing, and at times downright disgusting. A word to of advice when the author says a passage is not for people with sensitive stomachs please believe him. The brain is an amazing organ, full of wonders and mysteries. Many of the maladies discussed in this book have been featured in science fiction novels and movies. This isn't mentioned in the book, a reference to cinema, but I related it to films and books I have read. Kean not only mentions the maladies, he covers how what causes them was discovered as well as what has been done to treat them. Making this book, not only an interesting history book, but a wealth of information for fiction authors. Everything from phantom limbs to believing an ‘imposter’ has replaced everyone you know is covered. The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons is a well-written history of neurosurgery, which is neither boring, nor difficult for a layperson to understand. If the brain and it’s inner workings interested you, you should read this book.Originally Published: http://cozycornerandcafebookreviews.b..."
41,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3991456-maggie,3,"I wanted so badly to love this book since I loved Kean's previous work and considering my degree was in psychology. Unfortunately I don't think the style Kean has adopted (anecdotal, case study type stories to explain scientific phenomena) really worked for a book about neuroscience. What is so wonderful about The Disappearing Spoon is that with very little knowledge of chemistry, you can still easily follow the stories about the discovery of elements and the scientists who worked with them. The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons is not a story that can be told independently like that. While The Violinist's Thumb's later chapters involved some prerequisite knowledge, they didn't rely nearly as heavily as this book did on earlier parts of the book in order to understand the stories later. Neuroscience is too involved to understand anecdotally. And while case studies are certainly the staple of behavioral sciences, without a very clear understanding of the brain and how it works, those case studies mean nothing. I don't think Kean was able to use his style of writing with enough clarity as far as the function of the brain, for the stories to be enjoyable."
42,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28853-gramarye,2,"An interesting book with a good selection of examples from the history of neurological medicine, but the author's execution left something to be desired. There's a sort of mood whiplash when one paragraph bemoans the plight of individuals who were not treated with proper dignity and respect by medical professionals or the wider public because of their neurological condition...and then the next paragraph seems to take a leering, salacious enjoyment in describing some bizarre sexual side effect of another individual's mental injury or impairment. Hard to recommend a book that's so utterly tone deaf in parts. Which is a shame, because otherwise it isn't half-bad."
43,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34741339-robert-meyro,4,"The Tale of The Dueling Neurosurgeons explores the most significant brain injuries throughout time, and assesses how they impacted our understanding of how the brain functions. It is amazing how injuries to certain parts of the brain can cause such different outcomes. And we are still in the early stages of discovering how parts of the brain interact with each other. While the book was really interesting, I found myself back at school reading parts of my psych 100 book. Let's just say there could be something going on with my memory which prevents me from remembering the anatomy of the brain. "
44,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13496855-khadija,5,"The most fascinating book I've read in a while. Granted, I love any light reading on neuroscience topics but this is so compelling from the first page, I think anyone would enjoy it, even if you're not into non-fiction (a lot of it comprises of real-life stories that almost read like fiction) Overall, loved it and plan to read Sam Kean's other two books!"
45,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/594158-christopher-prosser,4,"This is an intriguing read. But if you've already read books by Oliver Sacks and VS Ramachandran, and "" The Brain That Changes Itself"", there isn't really new materiel. Just a little more context about the history at that time."
46,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25058417-jim-fix,4,"Excellent presentation of our attempts to learn how the brain works. We are learning more all the time, but this can give a basic understanding of how we found the primary lessons of the brain's thinking--and emotive--workings."

A book with such an amount of information yet does not get boring half you through is definitely worth it. There are some unnecessary details within the stories, but you can skip most of them without the book getting any less engaging."
48,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841844-sarah,5,"Books like this remind why I love of history of science so much. Took me back to Psych 1, Behavioral neurobiology, and History of Medieval Medicine. Loved it. "

54,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14706534-lg-a-library-girl-s-familiar-diversions,4,"This is going to be short, because I never really bother to take notes while listening to audiobooks, and I finished this audiobook almost three weeks ago. I had to look up nearly all of the names used in this review.This book used specific examples and case studies of individuals with brain injuries to explain how the brain works. The examples included people I’d heard of before, like Phineas Gage and his iron rod, and people I had not, like Daniel Carleton Gajdusek and his work on kuru (and his conviction for child molestation, holy crap). The author included a wide variety of examples, although at times I felt that his choices were a little U.S.-centric. At least two examples involved U.S. presidents.The narrator did a nice job and was really easy to listen to. My only complaint was that his tone was occasionally a little too light. The writing often walked a very fine line between entertaining and sensitive (these were real people, and many of them had been horrifically injured), and Henry Leyva’s tone occasionally added a greater note of humor to the text than I felt was appropriate.While the information and examples were interesting, this book is definitely not for everyone. It was extremely gruesome at times, although there was only one part (Phineas Gage’s initial “treatment”) that included a warning. And while, OMG, that part was awful, there were lots of other examples that made me cringe and/or left me feeling angry about some of brain research history.For example, I had known a little about Wilder Penfield and his use of electrical stimulation of the brain before performing brain surgery in order to reduce post-operative side effects. I think I might have even seen video of him doing it once, although maybe I'm thinking of someone else. At any rate, I recall the patient looking surprisingly at ease - aside from the exposed brain, not really the stuff nightmares are made of. That wasn't the case with another individual Kean discussed, whose name I can’t recall and haven’t been able to successfully Google. That particular individual essentially electrocuted an unfortunate woman’s brain until she died, published the results, and was then surprised when the medical community came down on him like a ton of bricks. He insisted he’d gotten her consent, but 1) she had probably been incapable of giving informed consent and 2) no one would have knowingly consented to what she went through before she died.There were also many, many examples of horrifying animal experiments. Again, I didn’t write down the names of all the researchers and haven’t been able to track them down, but one in particular stuck in my head. This researcher operated on rats, swapping the nerves in (I think?) their hind legs. He’d then electrically shock one leg. The rats would feel the pain in the other leg, and he wanted to see if they’d learn to adjust their responses. However, they never did - they’d favor the leg that was in pain, which put more weight on the leg that was really being injured, which put their other leg in even more pain. This same researcher performed similarly horrifying experiments on fish.All in all, this book both fascinated and repelled me. If I had been reading it, rather than listening to it, I imagine I’d have skimmed more than a few parts.(Original review posted on A Library Girl's Familiar Diversions.)"
55,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123581-valerie-kyriosity,2,"The science was interesting; the worldview, not so much. He gets things started with a nice fat logical fallacy: some people hallucinate supernatural things, ergo, there are no supernatural things. He keeps up that sort of dismissiveness throughout. And because there is no supernatural, there is of course no basis for morality. In a discussion of a neurological disease among a New Guinean tribe, this guy manages to brush off culturewide pedophilia as morally neutral; condemn big, bad colonials for oppressing poor innocent tribesmen (barely mentioning the fact that such interference made them quit slaughtering one another in atrocious ways at astronomical rates); and shower contempt on Christian missionaries for convincing tribesmen to abandon cannibalism while hypocritically offering them the body and blood of Christ. Bombastic blind bigotry. And isn't this precious: When a researcher decides to get in on the pedophilia act, he adopts a collection of boys from the tribe and brings them home to the States, the author (having already made snide comments about oppressive Western sexual mores) appears to find child abuse in this context unacceptable, based, apparently, upon the law given by the great god I-Said-So. And we're the delusional ones? In a later chapter, he enlightens us about the definition of wisdom: reasoning plus emotion. Yeah...that's why everyone without brain damage comes to the same conclusions every time. SMH. Anyway, I'd love to see more Christians working and writing (popular-level books like this as well as the way-beyond-me stuff I'll never read) in this field. There's so much to learn about how the brain/mind intersects with the spirit, and it can't start with a casual relegating of all things spiritual to the category of psychosis. A foundation of the fearfully made and fallenly flawed nature of man would allow for a much stronger building.Reader was fair."
56,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70460543-caitlin-caswell,5,"This is one of my favorite books. It can be pretty hard to read straight medical writing but that's part of why I liked is book so much, because the medical writing was broken up by fascinating and funny stories which made it a lot more bearable to read. Other readers said that the casual writing made the book feel less legitimate but I disagree. I think the casual writing made the book easier to understand since it read more like a conversation than a journal. It could even be pretty funny at times which is something I appreciated. Another common comment was that the stories told didn't relate to the book but I completely disagree. I think that each story tied in perfectly to help explain the science behind the behavior. Although there were times when I felt like Kean took the stories too far to a point where they were almost out of context. For example with Gajdusek, I felt like acknowledging him as a child predator was important but also off topic for the book. However that honesty tied into something I really liked about the book. I liked the way Kean used everything about the person, not just facts that would glorify them. It's definitely important to acknowledge the bad in these people since a lot of them did have darker sides that are usually ignored due to their success. I think someone who enjoys science would enjoy this book, but really I think that there is a wide audience that could enjoy it. It's a unique book in that it combines history, storytelling and science. There's more or less something for every type of person, but again, someone who is totally uninterested by any type of science might have a harder time staying interested. The aspect of the book that made me like it so much was the simplistic writing style when it came to explaining the brain. I'm very interested in neuroscience but I have found that a lot of books on the subject can be pretty hard to read. Authors tend to assume the reader knows every word relating to the topic when in reality someone who isn't in the medical field and is just interested in learning might struggle. Kean starts by defining each word that isn't commonly known and goes from there. The explanations coupled with comparisons and examples gave me an understanding at a basic level. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks the brain is interesting and wants to learn more. "
57,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44789316-raquel-evans,4," Definitely worth reading if you have any interest at all in the functioning of the human brain, the history of how we learned about those functions and how current theories compare to historical theories. It even touches on some uncomfortable but fascinating areas about how our sense of self ties in to brain functioning, and how the decision making process might be a bit different from what we think it is.  While all unpleasant details are general written in a clinical tone, which keeps them from being overly disturbing, I still can't recommend this book to anyone who's sensitive to medical details such as descriptions of brain surgeries or physical injuries, or to hearing about various inappropriate (sometimes sexually inappropriate) and/or criminal acts that come up in relation to some of these stories. Probably just for older teens and adults, but could make good high school reading for studying the brain."
58,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2141158-patrick,4,"The short of it:This book describes parts of the brain and their functions through several fascinating case studies that show what can go wrong after trauma.Why did I pick this book?I wanted to read a book that would reinforce my understanding of psychology and the brain. I teach at the high school level, so I wanted something that would be fun and possibly useful in my instruction.What did I think?This was organized around some very famous case-studies, and the author does a very good job in telling them and linking them to the brain. I found that I really enjoyed it, enough to share a few excerpts with future psychology students. Throughout the whole of the book, Sam Kean nods to the idea that our perceptions are actually physical, which may cause some discomfort to those who think that there is a separation between our brains and our minds. He also does away with some of the commonly held beliefs surrounding one Phineas Gage, whose story serves as a neat unifying end of the book. "
59,0316182346,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,5,"This is the story about a brain and the scientists who study it.All throughout history, doctors have been given glimpses into how the human brain works. From various injuries directly to the skull to diseases that eat up and destroy sections of the brain, much can be learned. Sam Kean tells this history through intriguing stories, glimpses into the past and how people reacted, and discoveries that were made. As time progresses, the science of brains continues to change and be revised, and Kean is very clear in his writing. The maladies are stranger than fiction, and you'll want to read this medical science book up until the very end.Definite recommend for anyone who likes micro histories, or simply want to learn more about the human brain."
