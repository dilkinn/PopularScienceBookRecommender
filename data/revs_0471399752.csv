Neuroscientist Susan Greenfield is exploring what happens when we are conscious, become self-conscious and to what extent this is never a fixed state of mind. Through many interesting themes (childhood development, addiction, depression), she suggests an explanation about how our unique sense of self is created. It's very well written and very enjoyable to read!"
1,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869891-aneta-jackowska-musiol,5,The author's attempt to explain how conciousness is represented in our brain made me marvell on how perfectly God has created us. Noticing a light requires a compatible work of 10.000.000 neurons in our brain that cooperate with each other with a speed of 10.000 cm per second. It is enough to remove a fluid-filled microtubules from a cell and this process would slow down to one meter per 50 years!
2,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81613738-jennifer,2,"The author has a really interesting theory around the importance of emotion to consciousness and the functioning of the brain. However in this book she fails to make it either interesting or readable. It was only written in 2000 but the dismissive labelling and nature of the way she writes about common mental health conditions or addictions made it feel much older. Given her theory of the importance of emotion, it is strange that this book feels so divorced from contact with anything resembling something as messy and unscientific as a feeling. In fact youâ€™d be forgiven for wondering if things would improve if the author actually met a human."
3,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104688854-marcus-anderson,4,The author makes clear throughout that she is presenting her theory of emotion which is also presented and structured for ease of understanding and clarity of argument. I found this approach invites an open and inquisitive mind which makes the reading experience quite enjoyable. Some prior knowledge of the subject area will make this a much easier read. 
4,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77774876-valerie-kroneanu,4,"A bit dull, but very informative and ultimately quite hopeful."
5,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60340599-wade-profe,3,"Interesting like most neuroscience books, but like most neuroscience books, many issues are coloured by the authors presuppositions and become a little convoluted."
6,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15143818-colin,4,"A little too theoretical for my liking, but a good overview of current neuroscience research."
7,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"Nueroscientist Greenfield offers up a hypothesis waiting for more advanced technology to test it. The good news is that it IS falsifiable, so it's scientifically coherent. Central to her thinking is that the brain creates consciousness and the unique sense of a self from the mechanics of neuronal functioning that correlate with emotions. Thus, Greenfield says, emotions are the most basic form of consciousness and determine, ultimately, the depth and or breath (or lack of such) of consciousness. The more intensively we feel, the less sense of self is experienced. This sounds true from experience (think orgasm, drug-induced euphoria, dance etc). Sensorial presence fully embodied in the present moment leaves little space for what Patanjali might call asmita the thought of ""I-am-ness"" to arise.Greenfield sounds like a Buddhist when she writes:""We are not fixed entities, certainly not as we grow up, but neither once we live as adults from one year to the next, and even from one day to the next. Even within a day, within an hour, we are different. All the time, experiences leave their mark and in turn determine how we interpret new experiences.... self consciousness itself is not fixed. According to the idea developed here, it will ebb and flow in inverse relation to emotions, from one moment to the next. Most important of all, then, we cannot expect, or even want, to be in a state of pleasure all the time. Such is the paradox of adult human existence -- the private life of the brain."""
8,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4148474-daniel-wood,4,"""What is happening in the brain when we drink too much alcohol, get high on Ecstasy or experience road rage?""These and other questions neuroscientist Susan Greenfield attempts to answer whilst proposing a hypothesis on how emotion, conciousness and mind are formed within the brain.A fairly heavy read that had me rereading several parts to properly understand the reasoning, this is nonetheless a very enjoyable book. The chapters on The Child and The Junkie I found particularly interesting.A criticism is that Greenfield tends to go to some lengths to poke holes in conflicting theories proposed by others. Where explaining the logical or scientific flaws might suffice, Greenfield has a tendency to pick up on analogies used by authors and then deliberately stretch these beyond breaking point."
9,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927983-lise,3,"I enjoyed the book a lot, but found it a bit difficult to slog through, probably because I don't have any background in neurology at all. The endnotes are very clear and helpful, though, and she lays out her model very clearly. I'm still a bit confused on the working definition of consciousness, though. If it's purely 'self awareness' then why are dreams considered non conscious? I was also bothered that the quantum association was added, since it seems to be predicated on a pretty wacky strong-coppernican interpretation of quantum theory. Other than those two points, I enjoyed the book very much."
10,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158627-azn,3,"This book provides a wonderful insight into the brain. It is a challenging read which will serve to broaden your linguistic capabilities whilst enlightening you about the complexities of the human brain and its interaction with the environment. I recommend it to those who are passionate about neuroscience and overall human emotion. However, I would have liked for there to be a greater discussion on neuroplasticity, which was only vaguely touched on."
11,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43063169-darron,5,"I agree that it's a tough read at times, but overall found it to be a very interesting and thought provoking book. Has certainly equipped me with a better understanding of the workings of the brain and it's myriad of chemical, electrical and cellular processes/interactions. Susan's model of consciousness and emotions is heavily based on research and comes across as being at the forefront of books covering neuroscience. Whether this is your field of interest or not it's certainly worth reading"
12,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16273328-luca-campobasso,4,"Though it was a rather difficult read, because of the author's digression habits, the content was pretty enjoyable and I got many more insights in emotions' inner working. Who is searching for a read dense of information but not too heavy, it is suggested. Also for whom doesn't know anything about this field, because of the lack of too-technical language."
13,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155128-pirronne,4,"not as readable as ""a user's guide to the brain,"" but very interesting. it takes a while to get used to her sophisticated lines of logic, but it's totally worth looking at. just read the user's guide first, i'd say. "
14,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679357-laura,4,"I had to read this for one of my classes in college. I really enjoyed reading it. I am glad that there are more than one kind of intelligence, and I don't have to be book smart to be considered intelligent."
15,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6629389-adrienne,2,This took me two attempts and months to get through. Interesting content but I took issue with the language. Especially the lack of person first language. This was published 16 years ago so I would be interested to know if Greenfield would write the book any differently now. 
16,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526014-gael,5,Easy to grasp. Very interesting.
17,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8699191-sonal,5,"Enjoyed every bit, very enlightening, pleased to know why somethings happen"
18,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18800475-dan-martin,2,Far too technical for a so-called popular science book. A real struggle. Yawn.
19,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6280286-tim-dempsey,3,Not the most accessible read but interesting. Certainly not a page turner!
20,0471399752,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889660-barbara,2,It's been a few years since I read this book. I can't remember the content just my irritation that a scientist should not have collected her ideas better and written less sloppily.
