0,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/862611-jen,2,"ok. So, I am a harm reduction activist and an addictions researcher. I write those ""dry sociological studies"" that Hari enjoys rolling his eyes at. I basically hate-read this book out of a sense of professional obligation. Not because of the story Hari told, but for the atrociously bad way he told it.I hated this book a whole lot. This is a sensationalist and problematic book. It has been touted as some kind of game changer in the conversation about addiction, but none of the information in this book is new, and Hari didn't even bother to fact check some of the things he's saying about certain scholars. This book is overtly anti-intellectual. Hari frequently attributes thoughts and motivations to people who are long dead--people whose thoughts and motivations he has no access to. It's also clumsily written, his only rhetorical move apparently is the section break with a cold narrative opening. He uses this technique with tiring frequency in the text.But, above all, the biggest problem with this book is that there is nothing new in it. This is not ""investigative journalism"". It's about as investigative as interviewing a handful of physicists and then writing a book about how I ""discovered"" calculus. This book regurgitates messaging that harm reduction activists have been offering for years and years, and then packages it in a disingenuous veneer of disbelief and personal bias.But, honestly, can we expect much more from a person who had to give back his Orwell because he plagiarized the piece that won the prize? (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann...)I could MAYBE recommend this text for someone who is completely ignorant of contemporary conversations around drug use. If you can explain the public health impact of a needle exchange, though, this book is beneath you."

Here in this book we have strong evidence, all over the world, of a compassion-starved state of emergency, of antiquated laws driving people into isolation, ostracizing them and pushing them further from essential human connection.I've never before listened to the argument that we should legalise all drugs, mostly because the person who's brought it up only wants to legalise drugs so they themselves can take drugs, and when we have this conversation these people are often on drugs also, and they superficially quote some single bullshit article that they read once because the title of it reassured them that they wouldn't have to change their opinion of anything by the end. Just like Russell Brand, these people give good ideas a bad rap, false and unwanted ambassadors that manage to make common sense unseemly!Anyways, this book is the opposite. The journey of one man who began to research the war on drugs and allowed his opinion to be swayed by the evidence, of which there is bucketloads, that legalisation of drugs is the way forward (and depending on the drug depends how, of course, and the best method for each is all explained and backed with real world examples of the given suggestions working.)Humans are animals and getting high is a thing that animals do. Best case is not abstinence but safe use (and safe use reduces overall use and encourages switching to less dangerous drugs!). The consequences of not accepting this are deadly.READ"

Engrossing Exploration of Drug War Failures
 ""I've seen the needle and the damage doneA little part of it in everyoneBut every junkie's like a settin' sun.""""Needle and the Damage Done,"" Neil Young, 1972An engrossing exploration of the failures of the ""war on drugs."" The narrative tracks through the war's czar in the U.S., users and abusers, peddlers, law enforcement, the poor souls who have been ""collaterally damaged"" (family members and innocent bystanders), current policy makers, as well as governments who have legalized certain drugs (like marijuana in Vancouver) and all drugs (Portugal). I also found his coverage of studies on addiction fascinating. The psychology is such a crucial piece of the logical simple economics equation: people will NOT stop using and abusing drugs. Governments will fail at stopping demand, prohibitions and restrictions on supply thus only influence prices and buyer patterns. This generates huger profits leading to bigger, stronger criminal rackets (gangs, cartels, etc.) and wars among them, as well as many more crimes by the drug abusers (thefts, muggings, murders) to keep the addiction fed, all of which results in much more harm to many more victims, deaths and exponentially higher costs to society.Keith Richards, Day-by-Day Devastation of Heroin AddictionWith a conversational writing style, Mr. Hari makes a compelling argument for legalization of all but darkly-affecting drugs like heroin and crack. While I do not believe I will see such legalization happen in my lifetime, this is a much-needed treatment of the subject that is certain to start conversations in some of the right locations. I cannot say he's convinced me of the answers, but I am much closer to his side of the fence on certain drugs after reading this book.I was definitely enlightened by this non-fiction book and recommend it, certainly if you have someone near and/or dear to you with a drug problem.

4,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan,5,Every now or then a book comes along that leaves you breathless and changes the way you look at the world. Chasing The Scream is one of those books a profound read that has made me rethink the war on drugs on made me look at how I carry out my own work.The war on drugs whether you know it or not has changed the very nature of the society we live in. It has turned a health issue into one of crime and by doing so encouraged more crime and violence. The evidence gathered in this book is overwhelming and when coupled together with the stories gathered by the author make for an unforgettable read. I defy anyone to read this book and tell me the War on Drugs is right and just. The author not only gathers evidence and personal stories but also traces the history of the War on drugs to deliver a well rounded read.As a Correctional officer that deals with the Drug Policy I thought I had a good grasp on this issues. I now find myself completely rethinking how we go about our drug policy and how we can move away from a punitive model to one that is supportive and understanding of drugs and addictions. I am in total awe of what Johann Hari has managed to deliver in this book and rate this as one of the most important books I have read.
5,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/316593-melissa,5,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time and should be a must read for anyone who works in the field of substance abuse/ addiction. It is well researched and offers a valid alternative to the failed war on drugs in the USA. I have always advocated for the legalization of drugs and a total overhall in our drug policies - this book provides evidence on why legalization is the way to go. It is compelling and fascinating. Seriously, just read it. Even if the topic doesn't appeal to you much, you should still read it. It was that good."
6,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19997559-heather,5,"Johann Hari sets out to answer some of our most pressing questions about “the war on drugs” in his book Chasing the Scream. Within the pages of this book, you will find out how and why the “war” began, how it impacts people from all walks of life, and how cities and countries across the world are changing the way they deal with both drugs and drug users. Chasing the Scream is an absolute gem, and I honestly feel that it's one of the best examinations of drug policy that I've read. Hari examines the motivations behind drug policy (past and present) by weaving together facts and personal stories. He discusses the racial and economic biases that led to the desire to criminalize drugs in the first place as well as how these biases are seen in today's policies. Few people are willing to admit that the “war on drugs” was, at least in part, a war on societies “undesirables” and seeing this discussed so candidly was refreshing. I grew up in a county that, at one point, had the highest rate of methamphetamine use in the state so I'm no stranger to the world of drugs and addiction. I thought I knew how drugs worked and why people became addicted. I thought I even knew why prohibition didn't work too well. This book challenged all of these ideas and has caused me to rethink a few of my opinions. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone whose interested in drug policy or even the culture that surrounds drugs and their abuse.  Note: I received this ebook free courtesy of Negalley in exchange for an honest review."
7,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368384-robin,2,"I have really mixed feelings about this book. Hari's writing style is excecrable, and his account of the drug war is oversimplified. I can't emphasize enough how poorly written this book is - it reads like overly emotional, ham-fisted pap. And yet, I have to say that I think this book's popularity will be a net positive on the balance. It brings together a lot of good arguments in one place and makes them easily digestible and relatable to the kind of reader who might not otherwise be motivated to consider them. Is it dumbed-down, poorly written, and intellectually dishonest? Yes. But it will help change the conversation about drug policy in the more mainstream circles of American culture. That can't be a bad thing."

The things I hard about were scarry and awful. Though much of this remains true, I can see where legalization of some of the drugs would certainly hurt the drug trafficers and we could use the money to much more humanely work with those who are and weil become addicted. Johann Hari has asked and worked years to answer many of the questions You and I have had concerning the drug wars. It is an interesting and very thought provoking analysis.J.

10,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"I've seen television interviews and roundtables with Hari, and when I found out that he had written a book about drug policy and the science and sociology of addiction, I immediately added the book to my library list. The book was not what I was expecting - but this is not because I was disappointed with it in any way. What struck me is how very personal this book was for Hari. His first chapter explains the history of drug addiction in his family, and how it has also affected him personally. This first-person narrative continues throughout the book as he interviews people all over the world, recounting detailed history of the beginnings of the drug war - how ""Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup"" (laced with morphine) was a bestselling tonic in Victorian times... and a few decades later, these opiates were suddenly vilified and rebelled against. The historical opening chapters were an eye-opening narrative of a famous singer and the law enforcement officer who obsessively worked to bring her down - and expose her addiction to the world, thereby going on to change drug laws not only in the US, but all over the world, and the first drug- dealing gangster of NYC and his manical and deadly rule over the boroughs. Incredible detail and strong writing - great introduction to the book, and Hari refers back to this ""groundwork"" many times throughout the book.Hari travels to the US, to Mexico, to Uruguay, to Canada, to Portugal, to Switzerland, and his own UK to learn about the global ramifications of this war on drugs. In the US and Latin America, the stories of powerful and horrific narco gangs are the true stories that have inspired popular films and television series (Sin Nombre, Narcos, Sicario, Breaking Bad) in recent years. In the US and Canada, and Europe, we learn of the addicts, and the deep stigmas and vilification of this population, and how some places - like Vancouver, BC - have worked extremely hard to change these stigmas.The addiction conversation continues as Hari works with scientists and sociologists who turn the tables on how society can help addicts. All of these pieces fit together for the final case for decriminalization and legalization of these drugs. All drugs? Certain drugs? The debate rages on, and Hari describes this in detail.The final chapter takes a close look at the two US states (at the time of writing in 2015) who have legalized marijuana for recreational use: Colorado and Washington. Hari interviews the advocates that worked in both states to legalize the substance, and how their philosophies and reasoning was vastly different. One of the final quotes in the book gave me a laugh, but also a pause - how much things have changed in a relatively short amount of time - and what we can expect in the future. Spoken by one of the Colorado attorneys who played a key role in the Colorado campaign: ""For years, the only discussion was: 'How long should we be locking people up for possessing marijuana?' Now we're discussing what the font should be on the label of the pot brownies.""4.5 /5 - rounded up because I learned so much from this book."
11,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,1,"I have always been very anti-drug war, and so I am very much the ""choir"" that Hari is preaching to, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this book. From a policy perspective it seems like it could be very persuasive, so from an ""ends justify the means"" point of view, maybe I am a bit happy that it's out there, but it embodies almost everything I hate about popular journalism. I think that this New York Times review gives a good idea about many of this book's problems.The absolute stand-out issue with this book is his pushing idiosyncratic views of addiction as if they are proven; for example, you can read this article about how the Rat Park experiment is flawed and misleading, which discusses how Hari's book has caused a revival of the study's popularity.I think the overall problem with the book is that Hari's goal was obviously to generate a compelling narrative, and preferably a narrative that neatly makes the argument for drug legalization. Unfortunately, the world is, as always, nuanced and complicated and so when ""create a narrative"" is higher on your list of priorities than ""convey the truth"", you end up mangling true stories until they fit your narrative. As an example, Hari's favorite device is clearly the ""journey of discovery"", so it feels like every other sentence he's ""discovering"" some ""shocking truth"" that goes against everything he thought he knew. Hard to square this with the fact that he's been an advocate of drug legalization since at least 10 years before he started writing this book, apparently writing a well-known article about it called ""Just you wait until I grow up"" in the New Statesman.1.5 of 5 stars"

It's been almost 100 years of doing it in a way that has only made it worse. We have high crime, drug addicts, diseases, gangs, death on the streets, incarceration that is off the charts, people afraid of cops, on and on.

18,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47287136-michelinaneri,1,"I only read the first third of this book before I made the mistake of Googling the author. There are too many books in the world I want to read without wasting my time on a disgraced journalist who betrayed the trust of his readers with plagiarism, fabrication and lies. Why should I ever trust anything he says? How can I trust anything in this book? Lying in journalism is a betrayal that I cannot forgive. Also, the unnecessarily sensationalist style of his writing, with the breathless and clunking opening to each chapter, reminded me of Dan Brown more than anything else. http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/bre...""The key problem with Hari's approach to interviews... is that he has deployed the Noble Truth defence – the idea that it is okay to play fast and loose with the facts, and with reality itself, just so long as you end up telling a 'greater truth'. The notion that one can reach 'the truth' by manipulating reality should be anathema to anyone who calls himself a journalist... Hari admits to substituting his interviewees' written words for their spoken words, quoting from their books and pretending that they actually said those words to him over coffee. But that is okay, he says, because his only aim was to reveal 'what the subject thinks in the most comprehensible possible words' and to make sure that the reader 'understood the point'. He says he has interviewed people who have 'messages we desperately need to hear', 'brave' people with 'vital messages', and therefore it is in everyone's interests that he present those messages in the clearest manner possible. Even if that means fabricating a conversation..."""
19,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19472134-robert-morris,5,"Read this book. Then get someone else to read it. This is not a flawless read, but it is a good one, and it is very very important. Johann Hari spent three years researching what he calls the ""beginning and the end"" of the drug war, and he has produced an absolutely damning account. I have been a convinced opponent of the drug war for decades, but I was stunned by the power of this book. By telling the stories of just a few of the lives destroyed by the Drug War he illustrates its insanity and outright evil with great power and sympathy. The bits of the book I found most valuable were the recounting of the tale of Harry Anslinger, the bastard who started it all, the new research on how addiction works, and most of all the focus on the experiences of addicts. Over and over again, he shows how drug prohibition turns people with a minor problem into criminals, destroys their lives and often kills them. I found some of the historical stuff a bit over reliant on a few sources, but there is almost nothing to complain about in his description of the contemporary drug war. It really is that horrific. These things are happening, and we are allowing it and paying for it. This book is a valuable contribution to the conversation, and the more people that read it the better. "
20,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"For me, the biggest message of this book is that America's war on drugs is utterly evil. It has caused tremendous amounts of harm in the form of ruined lives and broken families, massive unnecessary incarceration, and abuse by police against people who are defined as criminal for nothing more than smoking a bit of pot. It has created massive amounts of violence and crime, increasing, or even creating from whole cloth cartels and gangs that escalate their violence to prove that they should not be fucked with, and since they deal in illegal substances and have no legal recourse to protect their trade, they are forced into this kind of action. This is a direct consequence of prohibition, and it's something that this nation should have learned loud and clearly from the decade of alcohol prohibition. The war on drugs has increased the incidence of addition, forced people into usage of harder drugs than they might otherwise have chosen, and increased death by overdose, and secondary medical problems. It has contributed to the spread of AIDS. It has proven itself, in almost every way possible, to be a complete failure, accomplishing not a single one of its stated goals. And worse yet, America has forced this atrocity on nearly every other nation in the world.On top of that, the war on drugs, as led by Harry Anslinger, is at its core a racist endeavor, the fact of which is well documented in this book, and continues to this day as reflected in the skewed numbers of the prison populations. To add insult to injury, Ansliger himself dealt heroin to Senator Joe McCarthy, using government funds, and then, later in life, required daily doses of morphine to combat pain from his angina. This is the same man who is largely responsible for harassing Billie Holiday about her drug use, and helped to drive her to her death. The hypocrisy doesn't just belong with Anslinger, either. The U.S. government has pursued policies and political strategies to hide the truth, including threatening to cut off funding to the WHO unless they suppressed the results of a large scientific study of cocaine that didn't have results that fit the ideology of the war on drugs.Before I read this book, I was in favor of decriminalization of most drugs, but not necessarily legalization. Now, I am completely on the side legalization, with appropriate regulation, of all drugs. The arguments presented in this book are overwhelming. Drug addiction should be a matter between a user and medical professionals, who can administer the correct dose of clean drugs, and provide conselling and other tools to help addicts stop when they are ready. All users should have access to a social network, not be driven out of their homes, and cut off from society, which only drives them deeper into despair. I hope that lots of people read this book, and very deeply consider their own positions on this topic. If one's goals are to reduce death, reduce addiction, reduce crime, reduce the burden on the justice system, increase happiness, reduce governmental costs, and actually help people, then there really is only one correct position, and it is to eliminate this senseless war on drugs."
21,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066546-michelle,5,"Wow. I wasn't sure what I would think of this, given Hari's past difficulties, but since he made every effort to substantiate and document each quote, I happily relaxed into the very best argument for ending the drug war I've ever read. Not only was it articulate and readable and logical, but Hari uses the stories of those on all sides of the drug wars to illustrate his thesis, and the result is stunning. I honestly think this book would make the most diehard drug warrior a little shaken. For someone who has already come to suspect that the ""cure"" is worse than the ""disease"", it is devastating. I almost feel like there is no turning back after reading this---I have to step up my support for decriminalization and legalization, and for compassionate, humanitarian reasons. This is kind of funny, because I do not do drugs, or drink, or smoke, or even drink tea, coffee, or caffeinated soft drinks. I'm a teetotaler's teetotaler. But even I can see that what we are doing is not working--is, in fact, failing so utterly and so miserably that I can't believe it's taken us decades to even begin to see it. To me, each addict is a tragedy. But a tragedy compounded infinitely by being accompanied by unnecessary pain, sickness, disease, poverty, violence, death, mayhem, overstuffed prisons, and forever-ruined lives, in all directions, all over the world. And all unnecessary. This book is a revelation. The more widely it is read, the more hope. "
22,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3667598-sarah,4,"I think this is a very important book in the discussion about addiction on both a societal and personal level. The accounts and studies that Hari reports upon add some food for thought. My biggest trouble with this book were the stories. While I understand their importance, their narrative handling felt overly sentimental and my emotional strings were yanked around. It felt more manipulative than heartfelt. Perhaps this was partially due to the narrator, or perhaps not. I have also read about Hari's questionable reporting ethics. He was caught with plagiarism in his first book. Then, he was caught editing this incident off his Wikipedia page under a pseudonym. While I agree these actions are wrong, it is a reminder that readers should never read anything as 100 percent ""true"" because it will have always been written by a human and, therefore, imperfect. Some reviewers question the believability of this book, because he was caught. Does that make a journalist who wasn't caught anymore believable? Regardless to what we read, we should never take it on blind faith. Instead, we should absorb each morsel and determine our own minds to the best of our abilities. Regardless to whether this book is subjected to future scandals, Hari presents very interesting points that should be thought about. 1. The drug war has ruined Mexico. I have personally met several people who have immigrated from Mexico who confirm this statement. 2. Legal punishment does not deter addiction. It just makes recovery more difficult. Based on the addicts I have known, this also seems to be true.3. Addicts need love and acceptance rather than becoming social pariahs. Why is this not common sense? It seems so straightforward to me. Addicts use because they're in pain and lonely. Social isolation breeds pain. Love and compassion are emotional balms.4. The drug war is racist. One of the teachers I work with, who is finishing her PhD in law, has studied this and agrees. The prosecution for cheap drugs that poor people can afford, such as crack, have stiffer consequences than more expensive drugs that rich people prefer, such as cocaine. There are other points that I agreed with, as well. Of all the books on addiction I've read, this is different than any other. While I wish it covered a few more aspects of addiction, I understand that this is only one voice in a much larger conversation. I look forward to seeing what others add to this conversation."
23,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5981096-kamila,5,"This book completely changed my view on drugs, addicts and human connection. This book should be read by anyone who is interested in US History, has anyone close with an addiction of any kind, or is interested on how the prohibition started and the reasons behind it. It is very well written and it leaves you with the desire to play a more active role in the war on drugs. "
24,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,5,"This is masterful nonfiction. The best nonfiction informs and illuminates, making a reader feel more compassion or more passionate (or both) about a subject. Good nonfiction is not staid or dry: it’s provocative. And this book is incredibly provocative. It’s also heart-wrenching and difficult to process. It made me angry and sad, while giving me the smallest of glimpses outside the bubble in which I have the privilege to reside. Hari writes several books in one here. The first book is a well-researched dive into how the government created a war on drugs in the first place. Here we meet Harry Anslinger, a villain so perfect that it seems he’s been made up. From the late 1800′s into the next century, Anslinger climbed the ranks of government to become the Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics–a position he exploited to wage his own personal war on drugs (marijuana, specifically). Hari doesn’t pull punches, showing clearly the disgusting racial motivations to government intervention in drug trade and how that mentality persists, harms, and eradicates families and people today. The other book-within-the-book discusses addiction on a more personal scale: the reasons why it happens, the incorrect assumptions about how it can be cured. Hari discovers centers and research that show that addiction is often synonymous with a lack of human connection: that a lack of compassion and connection perpetuates the addiction cycle. Intertwined here we find personal stories, the most devastating of which occurs in the almost unbelievably violent chapter about the Mexican drug trade, warring cartels, and the effects these two things have on the local populations there. Hari’s hypothesis–that the war on drugs perpetuates the trade, sale, and use of drugs–is aptly supported by the research and anecdotal evidence he places throughout the book. It’s impossible to come away from reading this without being changed or affected. It’s a masterful book and I encourage you to read it."
25,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Drugs are not what we think they are. Drug addiction is not what we have been told it is. The drug war is not what our politicians have sold it as for one hundred years and counting. And there is a very different story out there waiting for us when we are ready to hear it-one that should leave us thrumming with hope.”This starts of by focusing on three people, Harry Anslinger, the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Arnold Rothstein a racketeer and the singer Billie Holiday. Hari builds up an intriguing back story to the origins of the war on the drugs, which helps us understand how we got into the mess we are in today. The 20th century saw some dramatic changes within the US’s attitudes to drugs. The Harrison Act of 1914 saw the banning of heroin and cocaine, though six year later would see one of the most idiotic, ignorant and ill-informed decisions the US made throughout the 20th century, when it brought in prohibition. As we know prohibition invites excess, but the unmitigated disaster of the prohibition era unleashed a catalogue of horrors onto the nation, as well as poisoning, disabling and killing upwards of tens of thousands of people throughout the land, it gave rise to a number of organised crime syndicates, which empowered many dangerous people who would go onto flourish for decades afterwards.This was a huge lesson in what happens when you marginalise, criminalise and dehumanise people for political capital. Of course, not only was it one that America was incapable of learning from, but it would go onto to commit even further chaos and horror for many more people in the shape of the war on drugs. Like any war anywhere the first casualty is usually the truth. Of course what the war on drugs really is a race war, it is also a war on the poorest and neediest in society. This is a murky sphere where the likes of myth, misinformation, emotion and plain old lies, trump reason, truth and scientific evidence almost every time.One of the most shocking facts to emerge from this book is what goes on in the US prison system. Without doubt the US penal system is one of the most cruel, ignorant and punishing on earth. This is a nation which has imprisoned more people than anyone else in the world and possibly even history. We learn about a mentally ill woman who was forced into an exposed cage in the desert and guards not only stood by and watched her being boiled to death in the heat but some of them laughed and ridiculed her as she died a slow and painful death?...Some of those guards still hold those jobs today.Then there is the notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio. His brutal approach is not so much tough love as cruel bully. A barbaric, medieval scenario which you would more commonly associate with middle eastern theocracies. The conditions of his complex will be familiar to those who have read the many accounts from men in Guantanamo Bay. Tent City in the Arizona desert is a women’s prison where inmates are given two grim meals a day, a brownish slop that Arpaio once boasted contained “rotten” lumps. There is a purposely built air-conditioned building standing nearby but Arpaio threw the prisoners out and uses it as an animal shelter instead, leaving physically and often mentally ill prisoner languishing out in tents (some of them dating back to the Korean War) as dust storms rage and poisonous creatures roam.“If I speak the truth to you I will go to the Hole and it’s awful, you have nothing. Please understand, I’d like to talk to you but I can’t. They are watching us.” So read the note from one terrified prisoner handed to the author during his visit to this facility.Staying with the state of Arizona, we learn about the case of Mark Tucker a mentally disabled man who was kept in solitary for so many years with countless pleas for a cellmate refused, he eventually set himself on fire, and ended up with 80% burns. The Department of Corrections responded by charging him $1.8 Million for the medical care he received.We see the many cruel and vindictive ways in which the US government works. It does one of the things it does best, it creates problems where they didn’t exist and it exacerbates existing ones. They threaten, bully and intimidate other countries into doing what they want. They spread fear, mis-information and claim to be an authority on something they know little to nothing about. And if you dare question or oppose any of it, no matter how ridiculous it is, then you are fingered the enemy and part of the problem and action is taken against you.“In 1995 the WHO conducted a massive scientific study of cocaine and its effects. They discovered that “experimental and occasional use are by far the most common types of use, and compulsive/dysfunctional (use) is far less common.” The US government threatened to cut off funding to the WHO unless they suppressed the report. It has never been published; we know what it says only because it was leaked.”Thankfully it’s not all bad news, the deeply uplifting story of Vancouver, which now boasts the most progressive drug policies within the entire North American continent is inspiring. This is largely due to the work of poet and community organiser, Bud Osborn and right wing politician Philip Owen, who after much pressure and persuasion decided to go undercover to see what the lives of addicts were like and his experiences would permanently alter his outlook and go onto change policy within the city. “Whatever gave (you) the idea folk in authority operate according to reason? Your trouble is you’re being rational.” So said Dr. John Marks to the author. We learn of the tremendous work this man did in Liverpool until the US government and the Conservative government intervened and in spite of legally prescribing heroin to addicts from 1982-1995 without recording a single fatality and improving the lives of countless people, he was closed down and since then addiction and the crime around it has soared back up in the city and many users have lost their lives.Geneva in Switzerland, a country hardly known for its liberal tolerance (It didn’t give women the right to vote until 1971) had some ground breaking reforms which made a huge impact on drug problems there. Then there is the case of Jose Mujica the Uruguyan president who legalised cannabis. The most notable and encouraging examples is with Portugal. They have set the standard throughout the world and dared to approach the problem with an open mind and a firm sense of reason and by decriminalising drug use and putting in place many social services, it has produced some truly astonishing results. One way to sum it up is in the years since heroin was decriminalised in Portugal its use has been halved while in the US where the war still rages on it has doubled. This is a hugely important piece of work and it makes for essential reading. I would love to believe that some of the politicians in many parts of the world would read this, take notice and respond to the evidence and facts in a positive manner and try to instigate some meaningful change."

I've always liked the work of Johann Hari, despite the controversy which surrounded him recently (and which he has openly admitted and accepted guilt for - which in itself boosts him in my eyes) so I was looking forward to reading this book. If there is a clearer, harder hitting, more balanced and more shocking book describing the stupidity of the war on drugs, then I've not seen it. There were parts of this book where I found myself in tears at the inhumanity meted on some people and the loss, tragedy and horror which the continuing war on drugs perpetuates. And to see how it arose out of the most sickening form of racism and bigotry made it all the worse. I honestly couldn't believe how so much of this was happening in a supposedly civilised and modern country like the USA. Read the chapter on the prison (which amounts to nothing but a concentration camp) in Arizona. It broke my heart. This is one of those books which everyone should read. It isn't all depressing - there is a great deal of hope and a lot of reflection from the author, but this should be the first battle cry of a world which wants to stop the violent, destructive criminality and the destruction of lives which the drug war has undoubtedly precipitated."

It has certainly influenced the way I perceive drugs, drug users, drug addicts, social policy and the drug war. This book made me recognize and reconsider social prejudices and preconceptions that I didn't even realize I had. I recommend it to everyone. To paraphrase the author, the effects of drugs and drug prohibition have a much broader influence in our lives and global society than most people imagine and those effects are not limited to those directly involved with drug use and trade."
29,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,5,I loved this. It's just the sort of non-fiction book that I enjoy. Perfect for any fans of Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City or The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. 
30,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23193614-scott-murray,5,"Incredible book. Must read for anyone that wants to understand the roots of the disastrous war on drugs. Hari makes it stunningly clear that this war will not be won, and that it was misguided from the start. Beyond comprehensive. Reads brilliantly. Since the first page I felt like I was sitting next to my incredibly smart friend as he laid it all out on the table."
31,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79828212-hugh,5,The story telling is so beautifully woven throughout the pages of this book as it explores the history of the drug war and ways in which people have combated it. I don't think I've ever teared up as much reading a book as I did for this. Peoples stories and events in their lives are so wonderfully written yet truely harrowing. A great book to read for anyone who has been touched by addiction or even anyone mildly interested in drug use or policy.
32,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109185858-ben-spinks,5,The most insightful and poignant analysis’s of addiction and the failed war on drugs I’ve read. Hari masterfully intertwines over a decade of personal research with almost a century of scientific literature to create an unbiased yet persuasive text that is impossible to put down 
33,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19799644-romantical-skeptic,5,"Having spent basically zero time thinking about the drug war and its many effects (outside of watching The Wire), this book was a revelation.The bottom line is that US government policies implemented 100 years ago with all the good intentions of strengthening the moral fiber of its citizens and creating a safe, drug free environment for children failed because it ignored the basic truth that drug-taking and addiction is a symptom, not the cause of evil.Our instinct is to punish anyone who shows weakness enough to succumb to addiction. It’s to hide those people away in jails or in clinics, where we can just shake our heads and give them up as hopeless causes. We hear about violent deaths and horrible sexual and other abuses, and disease with this sense of schadenfreude – “we told you this would happen if you did drugs, but you did them anyway…I mean, in a way, you kind of asked for it…” I am guilty of these feelings. I don’t have any personal experience with drugs or addiction (ok, maybe I have some familiarity with pot and there’s an uncle or two who’s generally known to be a drinker) so I don’t think about drug abuse in a very tangible way. It’s easy for me to just quickly look away if there is someone with an obvious problem in front of me. And yes, I also have that instinctive hatred/fear of this dangerous part of people.Here’s what I learned from this book that has changed my mind about the prohibition approach towards drug policy1. Addiction and drug taking is a symptom, not cause – most of the time, addicts have personal trauma that they are contending with. No one wants to be addicted, they just want to escape. To punish people who are already contending with extreme personal stress is counterproductive. If the idea is to just “get rid” of troublesome people, then the policy of incarceration may be fine. But if the idea is to create a safer environment for children and others then getting rid of those specific people is not really going to be effective because the “machinery” that led to the addiction in the first place is still extant in the world (poverty, child abuse, isolation etc)2. A policy may sound like it is put in place for “good reasons” but people’s motivations are rarely pure – even if they champion a policy that sounds good. We have to look at the downstream impact of a policy before deciding what is really good.a. Harry Anslinger – led the crusade against marijuana to ostensibly clean up drugs on the streets, but actually was driven by a racist agenda against blacks and Mexicans. Some delightful Anslinger quotes from the book:i. ""Colored students at the Univ. of Minn. partying with (white) female students, smoking [marijuana] and getting their sympathy with stories of racial persecution. Result: pregnancy""[17][18]ii. ""Two Negros took a girl fourteen years old and kept her for two days under the influence of hemp. Upon recovery she was found to be suffering from syphilis.""[18][19]I had shivers when Hari talked about how Anslinger at the end of his life, was suffering from a morphine addiction. 3. Studies about the addictive properties of drugs like cocaine and heroin are deeply influenced by government funding (obviously)a. We have been sold on this “Pharmacological theory of addiction” – take drugs even once and you’re sure to get addicted – but Hari cites studies that show that only 3% of users become physically dependent. And typically those who become addicted have backgrounds with some other kind of terrible trauma. Most people who are dependent can have functional lives if they can safely take drugs and don’t have to spend all their time trying to evade the law in trying to feed their addiction. Now, we may not love this idea that we just let users use and everything just goes on “normally” but that’s actually what happens (Hari cites the Swiss experiment, London experiments)b. The Rat Park experiment – the initial rat experiments that were cited to prove how addicts end up taking drugs to the exclusion of everything else (food etc) was based on experiments on isolated rats who were given the option of taking morphine or food. Over time, the rats become addicted and end up taking morphine over food. Then a new experiment was done where they allowed rats to live in social groups (the normal rat way of living) and in Rat Park, there was a lot LESS addiction formed. Then funding for this experiment was shut off and it’s never really gotten air time. The conclusion of course is that while some rats are going to become addicted, most won’t if you take away stressors like isolation.Very interesting book and very interesting topic. I am also happy to say that some progress is being made (Vermont, California, Uruguay, Portugal)."
34,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,5,"Completely changed how I thought about drugs, drug use, the ""war on drugs"" and how the illegalization of drugs is the cause of crime, NOT vice-versa. The solution is simple.IMHO this book should have started with chapter 16-18, get to the point, then go deeper. Just read 16 if nothing else. summary: If you want to pay less taxes, see less homeless, see less crime, and less needles in the parks, you must take a stance against the war on drugs and prohibition and demand legalization of all ""elicit substances.""Prohibition is the problem. People will always want drugs. By making it illegal, crime rises. Bootleggers go into business and that leads to more crime because the business owners can only use crime to protect their business. Users also seek more powerful drugs because they need more in smaller doses (example: people smuggle hard liquor NOT beer into football games... beer was america's drink of choice UNTIL prohibition, then it was hard liquor, then when prohibition was over, beer came back) Drug use/addiction is all purely coping mechanisms for unpleasant feelings. (Only 17% of any drug is actually addictive. The relief you get is what's addictive and that relief can come in other ways with the right support). We must start seeing it not as a crime but a mental health issue. We need to have those treatment facilities (they cost taxpayers less than ""policing"" and ""jailing"" drug use, and provide more effect results that benefit the addict AND all of society--less spread of disease, for example).We also need to setup a system like alcohol and tobacco. Adults can buy it legally but at the same time we, as a culture say that it makes you sick, you can't do it in most public places, and most of us find the habit unpleasant. (and if you sell to kids, use at work, or when you should be concentrating (i.e. driving) you lose your license/get punished--expand the booze/tobacco laws to cover level 1 drugs like pot)and for the more potent stuff like heroin (level 2), follow the same system we have for powerful chemicals we call prescription drugs. (as you read this Drs and pharmacists are handing out opiates right now for medical purposes, based on an professional assessment whether you need them) -- under this model addicts would be prescribed by their doctor while being offered all sorts of programs to stop using. (they do this in Switzerland and Portugal)Doing this would stop most of the problems caused by the drug war today. and we would have a huge new revenue stream too.BASICALLY, WE ALL NEED TO JUST HAVE MORE COMPASSION TOWARDS EACH OTHER, especially when the brother or sister next to us is struggling. Witness their humanity with love. QUOTES:""Imagine instead of sending addicts to an anonymous group w/ a brisk ""good luck"" we say, 'you will be given a safe, legal dose for as long as you need it, and while you use in this safe facility, we will give you support and care to help you rebuild your life, find housing, & keep your job""""Crime only happens when the legal route to the drug is disconnected (Drs refusing to continue oxy prescription or 'prohibition' )""It's not you it's the cage you live in"" rats who were happy and had a good life did not use drugs even if they had them available 24/7. But those in solitary confinement or depressed did become addicts - drugs g use is a coping mechanism.""“the opposite of addiction isn’t sobriety. its connection. if you are alone you cannot escape addiction. if you were loved you have a chance... one thing alone can ruin this. the drug war. if these people are picked up by the police during a relapse, given a criminal record and branded unemployable it will be even harder for them to create connections in the world where they can be loved, and stop being addicted”"
35,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24573110-michelle,5,"In this shocking and astonishing expose: ""Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs"" historian journalist Johann Hari chronicles prohibition, the rise of organized crime affiliated with the drug trade, and how the ""War on Drugs"" has failed humanity worldwide . Hari has traveled the globe, interviewing and documenting views from those who use drugs, sell drugs, also those officials in various levels of (worldwide) government agencies responsible for delivery of related social human services, and public drug related laws and policies.In the US unrelenting prohibition enforcement began with Harry J. Anslinger (1882-1975) who declared: ""History is strewn with the bones of nations that have tolerated moral laxity and hedonism"". Anslinger was known for chasing addicts, Chinese Dragons, and his stalking/persecution of Billie Holiday (1915-1959) and jazzman Charlie Parker (1920-1955). Hari documents the rise and fall of this notorious prosecutor, and how his ideals related to prohibition still influence public policy and opinion today. Early criminal element involving Mafia Arnold Rothstein who controlled the East coast drug trade illustrated double wars: this involved the war on users of drugs by state officials, and the war for control of the drug trade by organized criminals. This war continues today on a ""global battlefield"" by a criminally controlled industry; affiliated with the culture of vicious violence/terror, responsible for the deaths and suffering of millions worldwide.The US drug enforcement tactics prey on the weak, the underclass, those who don't have connections to state politicians/officials who can arrange for lighter sentences related to drug charges. A large part of law enforcement budgeting comes from property seized from drug suspects. At any given time 40%-50% of black males between the ages of 15-35 are in jail or have warrants for their arrest on drug related offenses. With compassion, Hari exposed the cruel unforgettable shocking death of Marcia Powell (May 20, 2009); who was forced on an Arizona Corrections chain gang for women drug offenders. Marcia Powell was not a number as defined by her inhumane jailers, but a daughter, and a mother with a son. Marcia Powell burnt to death in a human cage, cooked alive in the hot direct desert sun, until she collapsed and died after unsuccessfully begging for water. Nearby, a former air conditioned prison was used as an animal control shelter, while prisoners lived in the elements. Prosecutors declined to file charges against prison officials or guards in her horrific death.Drug addiction is related to causes involving trauma and isolation. In a ""UN Pledge for a Drug Fee World"" Hari notes that only 10% of persons who use drugs are harmed, the other 90% non-addicted, recreational users that represent the bulk of drug users are not harmed. The WHO threatened to cut funding if this detailed study by the Cato Institute were made public. Legalizing drugs by putting them in the control of licensed physicians, medical review boards or licensed medical professionals, would save an estimated $41 billion dollars a year, with additional funding raised by taxing drugs at similar rates to alcohol. The limitations of organized crime involving the drug trade would be curtailed, or possibly eliminated. The productivity resulting from decriminalization to rehabilitation (similar to the model outlined and used in Portugal) could save lives and promote healthier lifestyles, making the world a safer and better place for everyone.  "
36,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"Originally published on my book blog, TheBibliophage.com.Johann Hari did so much more than enlighten me in his book Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs. I met all the players in this war, from the government officials to the cartels and dealers, to those on the global leading edge of decriminalization and legalization. In addition, Hari introduced me to people still battling addiction and those in long-term recovery. This is a full spectrum book about an important issue, and I’m incredibly glad I read it.Hari begins in the early twentieth century, around the time of alcohol Prohibition, and continues to present day. In each era he tells stories of real people on both sides of the issue. Most of them are people I didn’t know much about, although he does delve into the life of Billie Holiday. I’ll never listen to her music the same way again.Hari discusses what people imprisoned for drug use experience. Then he introduces an alternative, where people are not only treated for their addiction, but treated like true human beings. The contrast between the two options is both striking and a little depressing. The current methods in the U.S. are so punitive and harsh. Still, I never understood the details of possible alternatives. Now I have a firm grasp on how a few other places address both drug use and sales.As a journalist, Hari presents facts. As a nonfiction writer on a quest, he also injects his own opinions regularly. His questioning nature drew me into the narrative, and reflected things I wondered as well. Like most of us, Hari has friends and family battling addiction. He just wants answers and perspective on the issue. Still, I felt like his writing was fairly even handed.I recommend pairing this book with The New Jim Crow or White Rage, among others.My conclusionsEvery stage of this book captivated me. I honestly couldn’t put it down. I recommend Chasing the Scream if this issue concerns you, but nonfiction isn’t typically your thing. The writing style Hari uses is extremely readable. I also think you’ll care about the people he interviews because their perspectives are so meaningful.In my home county, one of the candidates for District Attorney is talking a lot about this issue. It’s a key part of his platform. I’ve been supporting him on the surface, but now I understand each side in more depth. I didn’t realize everything I’d gain when I picked this book, but am glad it’s so relevant to my current local politics.My massage office is also around the corner from a methadone clinic. In the 8 years I’ve practiced in this location, the numbers of patients have grown exponentially. In addition, our family has also been touched by addiction. It is a public health crisis, not a criminal one. I will be recommending Chasing the Scream to everyone willing to open their minds and consider both sides of the issue."
37,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41413543-the-inked-reader,5,"I grew up thinking that drugs were bad and I wished that everybody who took them (speaking about ""heavy drugs"") should have just died immediately. Good riddance and that was it. A little harsh maybe, but when you grow up in a messed-up environment created by the constant use of drugs by more than one of your relatives, you can maybe justify my line of thoughts.I was enraged with all drug users, I was mad at my relatives and I was absolutely pro-war-on-drugs.With time, when I managed to get away and built a new life for myself, rage became pity and my view on drug addicts slightly changed. They were free to do it as long as they didn't come closer to me or interfere with my life.But sadly, it's not so easy. Statistically speaking, a great quantity of people that surrounds us in our everyday life do use drugs. Could be our colleague, our manager, our lawyer, our cousin..And so on. Drugs are everywhere and after having read a few books on the subjects I realized that there were no escaping drug users, there was no ignoring them or the problem in general.This book did not tell me that drug users are just a few, nor does minimize the problem in any way, it just gave me a whole new perspective on the subject.Starting from the beginning of the war on drugs and following its progression throughout the next century, Hari managed to open my mind to a totally new point of view on drugs and what governments should do to EFFECTIVELY eliminate the problem. Not only the problem of drug use but also of the criminality that surrounds it. Backed by sound research and interviews across the world, the author not only showed me how vast and deep-rooted was and still is the drug trafficking problem and how many lives are daily ruined and lost because of it, but also provided me with some actual examples and careful thoughts new ideas to how minimize (if not completely eliminate) the criminality surrounding the drug trafficking. This book does not tell us that taking drugs it's ok, it just tells us that drug addicts are human beings too and that there is something concrete that us, and hopefully our governments too, can do to help drug addicts and stop all these senseless deaths.We can't stop all people from using drugs, but we can stop the war. Cause it's not only drug addicts that are dying, but also many innocent and most of the times too young people.At the end of the day, drug addicts are wounded, sad people, people who can't cope with a word so tough and mercyless. At one point in our life, we all felt like wounded and sad people, even if we choose different methods to cope with it, different ways to escape from ourselves that had nothing to do with taking drugs. But we don't cure sadness by ignoring it, by isolating it or killing it...Hell, for all I know maybe we can't cure sadness at all! But we can learn how to deal with it, how to be supportive of other people dealing with it and we can stop criminality to thrive on it."
38,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5," This has been on my to-read list for a while, and I’m glad I finally got to it. I was impressed with his book Lost Connections, and this has a similar central theme, applying it to addiction rather than depression. The idea that both are rooted in a lack of positive human connections and/or a past of traumatic experiences makes a lot of sense to me. This book does two equally important things: It promotes empathy and compassion for addicts, and it makes convincing arguments for decriminalizing and legalizing drugs. The latter has some trickier details to work out—I’m still thinking about them—but I’m 100% on board with the decriminalization of drug use. I’m ashamed to think what my attitude toward drug addiction was before it hit close to home. Even after it affected me personally, my attitude toward addiction was angry and judgmental until I started reading up on it. It’s still hard to consistently respond with love when someone’s addictions make life stressful and hard, but I recognize it as the better way. This book spends a lot of time giving addicts a voice, and coming at the problem of addiction from a different angle.Hari starts the book with the history of the war on drugs in America, and then explores the ramifications of it both here and abroad. It’s a sad history with equally sad results. The book is filled with personal stories of people—addicts, crusaders, reformers, victims—whose lives have been affected by the war on drugs. It was a persuasive way to present alternative viewpoints and build empathy. The only chapter I really disliked was where the theories of Ronald K. Siegel were discussed. His theories about drug use just made me mad, and his animal experiments made me madder. He sounded like a crackpot to me. That chapter aside, I was fascinated by this book, and I highly recommend it, especially for people who like Hari’s other work and are interested in alternatives to a war on drugs. "
39,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15299089-mandi-morris,4,This book changed my perspective of illegal drugs. 
40,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15091414-ryan,5,"Chasing the Scream highlights the devastating impact the U.S. drug war has had on society and individual lives and how drug legalization, regulation, taxation and treatment would put an end to this destructive, decades-long policy.The drug war began in the early 20th century and was motivated by racist fears that drugs caused black, Hispanic, and Chinese Americans to lose their sense of place in society by rebelling against whites and seducing white women. In 1914, the Harrison Act was the first law to outlaw drugs, specifically heroin and cocaine. But it was really Harry Anslinger who can be credited as the original architect of the drug war. In the late 1920s, Anslinger became head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics which had been responsible for enforcing prohibition. With the repeal of prohibition, the Bureau faced obscurity and deep funding cuts until Ansliger promoted – against the advice of experts – the idea that marijuana was a dangerous drug used heavily by minorities, causing them to rebel. This reversed the Bureau’s decline and it was suddenly flush with funding.Anslinger believed that jazz, coming from the black community, was an abomination and that jazz musicians were terrible drug abusers. He targeted Billie Holiday in particular. Aslinger’s agents’ harassment of one the greatest jazz signers of all time helped to kill Holiday by preventing methadone treatment for heroin withdrawal while she was severely sick in the hospital with cirrhosis of the liver.In the 1930s, doctors were widely opposed to drug criminalization because they witnessed how it turned addicts, who were previously just average Americans with an addiction, into criminals who lost their jobs and committed crimes to pay for their drugs. These drugs, once easily available, were now monopolized by the Mafia and other criminal organizations that boomed with the criminalization of drug use, so much so that the criminal organizations were in favor of the drug war policy.In the 1950s, Anslinger took his drug war international and threatened foreign countries with U.S. aid and trade restrictions if they did not adopt similar strict anti-drug laws.The author, Johann Hari, also reveals the origins of criminal drug gangs, starting with New York’s Arnold Rothstein in the 1920s, who was the first gangster drug kingpin. Hari makes clear the connection between criminalization and street violence. When prohibition was enacted, the U.S. saw an explosion of gangster violence in the likes of Al Capone, but with the repeal of prohibition, such violence nearly disappeared until the dramatic escalation of the drug war in the 1970s and 80s when such street violence returned in force. Illegality drives increasing violence because greater brutality provides a competitive advantage in the drug market, so cartels and street gangs are always competing to be more brutally violent.Hari further highlights the structural racial bias in our judicial system and the cruel, inhumane conditions in the prison system.Humans have sought intoxication by drugs for thousands of years and research shows that other animals also seek intoxication, so it is a natural occurrence that is unrealistic to try and suppress. Further, research suggests that only 10% of drug users actually become addicted and have problems. The traditional understanding is that addiction is simply a matter of chemical addiction in the brain, but in fact evidence suggests that chemical addiction can only explain about 20% of drug addictions. Drug addiction is much more a response to childhood trauma or social isolation or stress. To fight addiction, we need to better intervene to stop and prevent child neglect and abuse and address how our consumer culture creates harmful social isolation.In the latter part of the book, Hari highlights success stories where the drug war has been scaled back and compassion is tried instead with the decriminalization or legalization of drugs. Hari tells of successful results in places such as Vancouver, B.C.; Liverpool; Switzerland; Portugal; Uruguay and Washington and Colorado state. Experience shows that when you remove the profit from the drug trade by giving away drugs to addicts in health clinics, along with treatment options, drug use declines because there are no longer salesmen pushing the drugs. And this approach costs less than arresting and jailing addicts. Overall, when drugs are legalized or at least decriminalized, many of the negative effects we associate with them decline dramatically, including street violence, other crimes, joblessness, overdoses (with regulation, addicts no longer have to guess at the potency of the drug), the spread of HIV, police abuse, and the prison industrial complex.Hari also briefly touches on the recent opioid epidemic and explains that it is a response to economic stress and the decline of the middle class. When doctors cut off access to prescription pain killers, users turn to illegal dealers where heroin (which is the same type of drug) is far cheaper and more abundant, resulting in people who were addicted to oxycontin or vicodin becoming heroin addicts.This is an excellent, must read book. It is a very compelling argument for the end of the drug war and the legalization, regulation and taxation of, and treatment for, many if not all drugs."
41,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"I would read this book after reading Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow, which does a much better job of summarizing the problem of mass incarceration in America and how it is fueled by the war on drugs. This author is a bit less critical than Alexander when it comes to methods. Sometimes she really digs deep and demonstrates how expert backed results are not as solid as they seem, but mostly that sort of critical examination is limited to helping her make her point. She makes it too easy for people who understand how statistics are collected to argue against her, thus putting her entire argument at risk. That is a shame because many of the ideas she puts forth in this book, which is primarily focused on legalizing drugs, are fantastic and should be seriously considered by policymakers in America and other countries with similar drug laws. Despite some flaws, there are some things this author does really well. Hari is great at illustrating the difference between America and other countries, who have successfully changed drug laws and have, as a result, realized a much more manageable solution to addiction and crime. She also does a great job of comparing the past prohibition of alcohol to the current prohibition of marijuana, and she conducts a very thoughtful investigation into whether legalizing all drugs, including the most addictive drugs, could be beneficial. Her points are compelling. Supporting her argument for the legalization of drugs, Hari provides wonderful evidence from neuroscience, criminology, and psychology to demonstrate that legal alcohol is actually far more harmful, in every way imaginable, than many other illegal substances. She gets an A+ for this. Her solid arguments were backed up by well replicated results from studies aimed at understanding the biological, medical, neuroscientific, and psychological effects of alcohol on a person. Bottom line, if confirmation bias and other heuristic mistakes drive you crazy when trying to read a book, you will have a little bit of a problem with this book. However, I think it is more than worth reading because the content outlines some of the most important topics in American politics today. We need to do something about our failed drug war. There is no question about that. Hari's suggestion, laid out in this book, provide a really great conversation starter because, in my opinion, the questions she asks are essential questions that must be addressed by every policy maker in America and everywhere else in the world.

42,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12201214-dave-dewitt,5,"I have a small section of my library that’s devoted to drugs, from Marijuana Botany to Hallucinogens and Shamanism. There are maybe 35 titles in my collection, but by far the best one is the one I’m reading now, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs. The author, Johann Hari, stunningly makes the following three points: “Drugs are not what we think they are. Addiction is not what we think it is. And the drug war has very different motives to the ones we have seen on our TV screens for so long.” One of his most interesting analogies is the spectacular failure of Prohibition, and the fact that, when it was repealed, some of the gangsters who were smuggling spirits and running the speakeasies were forced to declare bankruptcy. Compare that to the legalization of marijuana and we see that the smuggling of that drug from Mexico is way, way down. No self-respecting American wants to buy Mexican weed when the U.S. growers have perfected the art of organically-grown marijuana with little or no seeds or stems. When we look at heroin addicts living on the street, which came first, the drug or the environment? Hari notes that 90+% of all addicts grew up in broken or abusive homes and had horrible childhoods. Heroin became their solace that took away the pain. When soldiers returned from Vietnam addicted to heroin and re-entered their former lifestyles with family, friends, and jobs, and without their buddies being blown up, how many of them remained addicted? Fewer than 5%! This book will make you think and sometimes will bring you close to tears. I highly recommend it."
43,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56511297-bridie,5,"I started writing this review when I was only half way through this book. I couldn't wait to pinpoint every story and every theory that single handedly changed the way I view the world I live in which solidified my beliefs - love conquers all.I found myself having to take breaks between pages because of the millions of thoughts rushing around in my head. (Today was actually the first time in weeks I actually picked up the book and read it). My ears deafened by the crash of everything I have been taught about drugs and addiction in the past 20 years of my life and the construction of a brand new way of thinking took its place - windows the colour of rose being the first thing to go.Joann Hari is so careful and precise with every word that he writes. He explains everything so simply, yet with so much conviction. Behind the facts and theories, you hear his passion. Hari answers every question and turns every stone on the war on drugs, unveiling hidden history and underground stories of real life drug dealers and addicts in this day and age - what truly is their motive for doing what they do?""The opposite of addiction, isn't sobriety. It's connection."" ""Addiction is a disease of loneliness""Johann Hari, I cannot thank you enough for bringing this book into my life. You are helping me heal and helping me love."
44,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24798126-tommaso-querini,1,"Addiction is a complicated matter and this ""one-answer"" approach does not tell anything about it. Here you can read a detailed critique of the book: http://katiemacbride.com/2015/03/22/i...Also consider that when the Rat Park experiment was repeated it did not lead to the same results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park﻿lso, the fact that when veterans came back to the US and stopped being addicted could be explained with a mere change of environment and absence of cues (that trigger craving), not necessarily with more connection with their place of origin. Actually many veterans faced depression, social anxiety and PTSD rather than ""connection"". http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12... Genetics influence around 50% the likelihood that you will become drug addicted. This is shown through cross-adoption studies: sons of alcoholics adopted at birth have 4 times higher likelihood to become addicted themselves. The opposite is not true: sons of non-alcoholics raised in a family of alcoholics did not have an increased likelihood to become addicted﻿﻿"
45,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4848626-keith,4,"All drugs (yes, all) should be legal, or at the very least decriminalized. Disagree? Read this book, then tell me you can honestly defend the ""war on drugs"" we've all seen shatter the lives of so many people, users and otherwise. It has been an epic failure, and does more harm to our society(-ies) than the drugs themselves would otherwise have done without it. The quest taken by Johann Hari was pretty extensive, and totally necessary to write a book of this scope. He starts in a good place, travels to all the right places to investigate... and by the time he arrived at the end had brought me round to his point of view.Despite the sort of navel-gazing and reflective writing style (the reason I didn't give it 5 stars), this was a really good book you should check out even if you're not that interested in the topic. You'll learn that a lot of what you thought you knew about addiction is wrong... and that something's got to change about the way we treat the addicted."
46,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721014-samantha,5,"I'm not speechless very often, but I can't form calm coherent thoughts about how this book has changed my outlook on drugs and addiction yet, because I am so excited. MIND BLOWN. I can't even.This book is revolutionary. A louder cry for social justice I have not heard in quite some time. The war on drugs which began 100 years ago and has been a catastrophic failure needs to end yesterday - read this book if you are skeptical or confused about what that may look like.What a wonderful compilation of beautiful story telling and compelling new thought. Should be required reading, especially for Americans who can't see the parallels between racism, violence, AIDS, addiction, and our ridiculous ""just say no"" policies which treat sick people as criminals and in which drug cartels are untouchable. (Also wonderful book to read on the heels of ""The New Jim Crow"" by Michelle Alexander.)"
47,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31256318-malia,5,"I was interested in learning more about the history of drugs, and the recommendations on the cover were glowing so I picked this book up. I could not have known how engaging, interesting, and important this book would be. The author has thoroughly researched the devastation the war on drugs has caused humanity for the last hundred years. This is an important eye opening book. I do not think of myself as conservative but even I was surprised by how clouded by prejudice my opinions were on this topic. I believed the hysteria we are told about drugs, the harm they do, the absolution of addiction. This book opened my eyes to the reality of the drug war and the real harm that is being perpetrated by enforcing this harsh law. This book taught me to be more compassionate. I could not stop reading this book from the moment I picked it up. "
48,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2857458-signe,5," I haven't finished the book yet, but it is one that I will not put down and think that was interesting. It is one I need to wrestle with. I need to hand it around to several friends and discuss what this means for our community.  Every person is human and has dignity and a story. Instead of writing off drug users as worthless, how would our society change if we saw them as humans with hard stories? What if we saw people who needed help instead of problems to be swept away? How would we become more human if we were willing to listen to those we prefer to not see? I cannot let myself objectify people. This book is one I will be thinking about and coming back to for a long time."
49,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,4,"I really liked this book, though I don't really care so much for the author. The war on drugs — obviously a failure, right? It's racist, it's expensive, and it's entirely counter-productive. It harms the people it's supposed to help (addicts, victims of drug violence) and helps the people it's supposed to harm (the drug dealers and distributors). If you disagree with the above, then you really haven't been paying attention the last several decades, which means you really need to read this book.The conclusions Hari draws while conducting his research are the same as the ones I draw. I believe 100% that drugs should be sold legally for a whole host of reasons — reason #1 is that doing so would at least put some regulations on them.There are some fascinating anecdotes here, and one of my favorites concerns a cop who worked on the front lines of the War on Drugs and who truly believed that raging this fight was right. One day he's on a street corner, waiting to make a drug bust, when a kid walks up to him and asks if he'll buy him a bottle of alcohol from a nearby liquor store. The cop laughs and tells the kid to get lost, but this episode causes him to rethink the entire drug war. The data shows that alcohol is a more dangerous substance that results in more fatalities than even hard drugs like heroin, and yet it's sold legally. Not only that, but because alcohol is legal, it is regulated. Contrast this with drugs which, being illegal, are sold by dealers who see only a sale — regardless of whether that sale comes from a 40-year-old housewife or a 12-year-old.The comparison to alcohol is one made frequently in ""Chasing the Scream"" because it is such a potent one. During the period of Prohibition in the United States from 1920-1933, people drank even stronger liquor than they did in the years preceding it. Hari cites the singer Billie Holiday's love of ""white lightning"" (aka ""moonshine) as an example of a drink that was popular during Prohibition but one that you aren't likely to hear called out at your local watering hole these days. The reason, interestingly, is that since it was risky to sell alcohol, you'd want to get the maximum possible profit on it — so you sell the highest proof alcohol you can get. The same can be said of drugs — states that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic in recent years have seen a drastic increase in heroin usage. Once your doctor, who has been prescribing your prescription drugs, suspects you've grown addicted, they are required to cut you off. Heroin is easier to get on the street because dealers make more off it. As a result, once prescription drugs become unavailable to addicts, many of them turn to heroin.Reason #2 I support legalizing drugs is that drug arrests and prosecutions overwhelmingly target minorities largely because, as Hari tells us, white people are more likely to know lawyers or someone who can make life difficult for those attempting a drug bust in a white suburb (poor working class whites not included).Reason #3 is that criminalizing drugs is an unbelievable waste of resources. Just think of all the money — not to mention all the pain — that has gone into executing the War on Drugs.If this book had been written a couple of years later, Hari might have been able to make a side trip to the Philippines to see how local communities are affected by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's policy of executing drug offenders. On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, we have Uruguay where you can get legal marijuana, and Portugal, where drug addicts can shoot up as long as they do so under professional supervision.Hari also takes us to some terrifying places. I'm thinking mainly of Juarez, Mexico, which writhes in agony directly across the border from El Paso, and a chain gang in the State of Arizona under the jurisdiction of convicted racist — and recent Trump-pardon recipient — Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the latter, we hear the outrageous story of a female drug offender who was kept in an open-air cage for four hours in 100+ degree heat — a temperature so hot we're told her internal organs literally baked inside her. This all makes it abundantly clear that if you support the War on Drugs, you are unquestionably part of the problem.The only reason that I can't give this book five stars is because of Hari. I can forgive the fact that in 2011 he was found to have plagiarized a significant number of his articles (though what other journalist could get away with a thing like that?), and I can overlook his consistently smug appearances on shows like HBO's ""Real Time"", but what I can't forgive is the way he too often takes away from the tragedy of the events he's reporting on to needlessly emote. ""To my complete surprise"", ""this went against everything I'd believed"", and similar expressions of disbelief are prevalent in a book written by a guy who has long pushed for drug legalization. So after the fifth or so time Hari that does this, I just had to chuckle. Anyone who knows his work knows he's clearly not surprised. Similarly, as I'd read previously, there are certain things Hari references, such as the ""Rat Park"" experiment, that he doesn't seem to examine thoroughly but merely accepts on faith because they fit his narrative.That's a pity. The many victims of the War on Drugs deserve less shoddy reporting than that. So while I greatly enjoyed ""Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days in the War on Drugs"" and heartily recommend it, it stops short of accomplishing all that it set out to and easily could have. Regardless, it's still the best book on the subject I've read."
50,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11376979-dr-lloyd-e-campbell,5," This is a mind changing book. He convinced me that the Drug War is far worse than the drugs. So ... Legalize all drugs and make them accessible in the most harm reduction way and legalize the selling of drugs. Drug use might increase some but we would eliminate drug cartels in one swoop, eliminate much violence, empty the prisons, increase tax revenue dramatically. We could use our new found gains for treatment instead of punishment.  The only drug I have trouble with is the only drug that is legal: alcohol. Alcohol is so destructive, it's hard to justify. I can see limiting alcohol to beer and wine.  As to the argument for all these changes-read the book. "

But for the most part, this book eloquently and accessibly tells all the stories of the drug war--from Marcia Powell's death to Rat Park to Insite to Portugal to Sherriff Arpaio's chain gangs. Engaging and well researched from start to finish--will hold any reader's attention and have a chance to convince any skeptic."
52,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3290249-nicola,3,"Given the extremely high star rating of this book (4.5) I was anticipating a masterpiece and came away disappointed. This book would be good to induce a paradigm shift in someone with absolutely no knowledge of drug abuse and a right wing view on how to punish drug users. However someone who has given some prior thought to the war on drugs may be disappointed. Full of anecdotal evidence and really no new information / theories on drug addiction and treatment. I learnt something new about the history of prohibition of drugs and Harry Anslinger, but that was pretty much it."
53,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2403779-lisa,5,"This book was an amazing story about the various layers of the onion the war on drugs has created. It is a chilling account of the wreckage created at so many levels: the origin, kids in poor neighborhoods, gangs, prisons for addicts, the Mexican Cartel, and much more. The author glosses a bit over how hard it is to live with or be around addiction, and is a bit naive to addiction in general. However, his overall social message about addiction hits the nail on the head and needs to be heard. I highly recommend it for an eye-opening and compelling read. "
54,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25374853-caroline-lampinen,5,"I read this book in a day, and had a and time putting it down. This is a solid companion book to The New Jim Crow - heartbreaking and straight forward. I especially appreciate Hari's tone throughout: he is constantly self reflective and transparent about his own biases and assumptions, normalizing and humanizing ideas we've been socialized to believe for a century- pushing readers via modeling (no patronizing, no accusations) to reconsider our thoughts as well. "
55,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26416859-calzean,5,"A book that changed my mind on the legalisation of drugs. A well structured argument that looked at where the war on drugs came from, the impact of drugs from the personnel experiences of users, gangs, police and legislators and an author who continued to ask why? A book that goes a long way to explain many of the problems in modern society."
56,1620408902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83387700-higgs,5,Truly recommend this one. I've been fascinated with the war on drugs for a while and I'm sure this book would change the mind of even the most hardened opposers of drugs. The advantages of legalising drugs far outweigh the disadvantages and that's been made clear through the words of the people in the book who had their lives messed up by a disastrous war that does more harm than good.
