There is a lot of talking about the willpower, however, there was no a book that would cover all the practical things that can improve it. In fact, this is a book about productivity, from the perspective of willpower. So, if you struggle with getting things done, this one might be a good fit for you.Top 3 strategies from this book that I applied to my life:* Identify and describe the inner conflict that keeps you from being productive.* Watch your diet—eat foods that keep your mind healthy, energetic, and focused.* Fight being negatively influenced by others.From this book, I extracted 16 strategies on improving your willpower and wrote a detailed book summary, available here: https://www.mentorist.app/books/the-w..."

I don't know if the author ""cured"" me, but she certainly made an entertaining and outstanding attempt. I had so many ""omg that's me"" moments I thought she was my biographer. I want Kelly to get more money so I'm hiding this review, but below are my notes as I went along:(book dish: vegetables)- Brain is like a muscle and will improve in certain areas with practice (e.g. juggling improves visual perception of motion, memory games strengthens memory). it also gets tired with use.- the prefrontal cortext is your ""willpower"" organ -- it helps you do the harder thing among different choices- meditation sends blood to the prefrontal cortext and makes it stronger- 3 aspects of willpower goals: I will, I won't, I want (big goal)- we cave to impulses when we're distracted, stressed and tired (the muscle is not effective)- our natural impulses: fight or flight. try ""pause and plan""- An ""I will"" problem might be better cast as an ""I won't"" problem. e.g. if you have trouble with ""i will go to bed early"" maybe ""i won't turn on the TV at night"" works better. try to make it fun and playful for you. (instead of ""i won't be late"" make it ""i will always be the first one there"" if you're competitive)- good eating, exercise, sleep all help your willpower muscle- slow breathing, shavasana, exercise, shot of greenery, nap, a little sugar all might help rejuvenate your willpower- if you overburden it, the willpower muscle will get weaker, and it works across different arenas. e.g. students cramming will inhale junk food. dieters cheat on their spouses more.- you can build up your willpower muscle by training it with small non-overwhelming habits (e.g. don't surf the TV during commercials)- beware moral licensing: that good feeling you get when you finish writing out your to-do list. you haven't actually done anything yet but you feel like you deserve a reward. you don't (basically the angel on your shoulder was satisfied and now all you hear is the demon). instead, ask ""why"" you resisted or did the hard thing. focus on your goals.- decrease variability: if you slip, make a rule that you will always do that thing for a month. helps you value future time.- beware dopamine fueled desires. Dopamine makes you pursue pleasure, it doesn't mean you experience happiness. Notice how it actually feels to actually do the thing you think you want to do. Often not that great.- try to create a dopamine effect for things you want to do (e.g. listen to music while vacuuming)- Beware ""what the hell"" effect. Forgive yourself for slipping up, it's natural and human. don't think you ""blew"" the whole diet and binge. - Effective stress relief strategies: exercise, praying, reading, music, time with friends/family, massage, walk outside, meditation, yoga, creative hobby- Worst stress relief strategies: gambling, shopping, smoking, drinking, eating, video games, surfing internet, TV or movies for more than 2 hours.- Frame the decision as a loss of future benefit instead of a current gain (e.g. is my future awesome body worth this cookie)- precommit -- burn your ships. tax your time. destroy your ethernet card, etc.- don't wait for ""future you"" to complete your to-do list. there is no ""future you"" that is full of energy, focused, diligent and loves doing taxes.- even a 10 mins delay of an impulse will make you reduce your flawed PV calculation of its benefit- social proof: what you think others are doing is a huge influence on your behavior. find a group of people who embody your ideals.- don't think about the white bear. supressing an urge makes it more powerful. instead, ""surf the urge."" stop and notice every physical response, notice your breathing. accept that you have this feeling sometimes. it's uncontrollable, but remember that you choose whether to act on them or not. remember your goal. the urge will pass like a wave if you wait.- imagine how proud you'd feel not succumbing to your urge.- people who think they're especially great at something are the worst"

I am so glad I read this book.The Willpower Instinct is based off of a 10-week academic-style class taught by the author. It uses the latest information from neuroscience to explain what exactly your brain goes through during a thinking or decision-making process and how to use that process to your advantage to increase your sense of self-control. That may sound boring or technical, but McGonigal has a knack for communicating difficult science in lay terms with a sense of humor to boot. For example, she asks you to imagine you are walking down the street on a beautiful day, and the birds are in the trees...singing John Lennon's Imagine. The book says at the very beginning that it offers NO EASY TRICKS to help with willpower. However, I found that to be completely wrong. Most of the techniques offered are quite simple. For example, as little as 5 minutes of exercise can boost willpower. Or just slowing down your breathing for just ONE MINUTE can also help your self-control. The science behind all these techniques are covered in-depth.I was even amazed by some of the scientific facts that I wasn't previously aware of. I am usually up-to-date on neuroscience, so learning something new (from a scientific viewpoint) wasn't something I expected with this book.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever struggled with willpower, goal setting, or motivation."
3,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,2,"This is basically a book for people in the thrall of a compulsion, habit or addiction they wish to change..... Me? I'm on a diet. And in fact much of the book was geared towards people dieting. It's range however covered a wide range of compulsions, and it could be utilized by anyone who wants to give up or change a behaviour.My enjoyment of the book was greatly enhanced by my sister reading it with me. We followed the author's suggestion to read only one chapter a week, the better to mull over and practise what we had read as we went along. Now, what did we think of the quality of information and ideas presented? Well, most of them were based on cutting-edge research, and most of the ideas given were completely new to me. That was a big plus. The author was not just re-hashing old psychology. Indeed some of the ideas presented were really counter-intuitive, and I am still trying to get my head round some of the exercises suggested. I'm going to give it a go though.....the research cited was pretty convincing.Some of the ideas though were outlandishly ridiculous, or at least me and my sister thought so. There were a few that had us rolling around on the floor with laughter, and we shall not be putting those into practice. A lot of the ideas though sounded extremely interesting - unexpected, but interesting - and we shall certainly be giving them a bash.All in all a fascinating book. I hope to come back at a future date and add another paragraph to this review. This is a *doing* book, and can really only be judged by the fruits of its ideas. I need to come back after I have been practising them for a while, and note the level of success.My one grump is that I think there should have been a synopsis at the end - a brief 'to do list' for the exercises presented. It would make putting them into practise much easier.21st August 2014 UpdateI'm afraid I can now hardly remember what the book was about...and I have not been putting its ideas into practice. This may well be a reflection of my own air-brained ineptitude. Regrettably no big changes as a result of reading it. I am therefore marking it down from four to two stars.------------------------------------------------------------Given the negative commentary that the paragraph above has evoked, I think I expressed my ideas badly. I will therefore add a comment ....I think I am at fault in one respect... I don't think I made clear the fact that I have read several psychology books that have revolutionized my life. Among these I would particularly recommend The Upward Spiral by Alex Korb, and Errornomics: why we make mistakes and what we can do to avoid them. by Joseph T. Hallinan.The book above was quite the opposite. Fairly interesting in places, but the ideas petered out like a damp squibs as soon as I put the book down - in spite of me having rigorously practised the exercises while reading the book (a chapter a week, as suggested by the author)."""
4,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"A fabulous book about willpower that surprised me with its insight and clean prose. Popular psychology books often get a bad rep for either oversimplifying science or complicating it to the point if incomprehension. Kelly McGonigal, however, provides concise, research-supported strategies supported on how to achieve goals - ranging from eating healthier to smoking less to staying faithful to your spouse. She gives a quality mixture of anecdotes, analysis, and applications to ensure that readers walk away with the tools to alter their habits for the better.I most loved this book for its emphasis on self-compassion. McGonigal enforces that treating ourselves with kindness when we mess up - because all humans mess up - increases our chances of succeeding in our pursuits. Indeed, tenderness toward oneself does not mean sacrificing ambition or resolve, rather, it entails using our ability to forgive ourselves as a driving force to do even better. While McGonigal shares tons of cool tricks from more basic and neuroscience-oriented scientific studies to improve willpower, her consistent push toward loving oneself elevated the depth and meaningfulness of The Willpower Instinct. Overall, recommended to anyone interested in psychology and/or to those trying to make a change in their lives. If you want a more in-depth look on how to improve your relationship with food, I would recommend 
Intuitive Eating
 by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch, and if you wish to learn more about the flawlessness of self-compassion, check out 
Self-Compassion
 by Kristin Neff. Thank you, Kelly McGonigal, for writing a psychology book that slays."
5,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14604576-alex-kenjeev,5,"I'm now reading this for the second time. It has a lot more science, and a lot less self-help nonsense, than you might expect. And yes, it is OK to admit to reading it -- nobody's perfect when it comes to willpower!Here's a sampling of what I learned from Dr. McGonigal's book. 1. Willpower is centered in a specific region of the brain (within the prefrontal cortex). It uses more energy than almost any other brain region, and therefore it gets tired after prolonged use each day. It's also like a muscle, in that training it - through very specific meditations, breathing exercises, and a few other tricks - increases its strength and endurance over time.2. Heart rate variability is the most closely correlated metric to willpower. There are specific things you can do to increase your heart rate variability if you need a quick willpower boost. For example, slow down your breathing as much as possible (ideally 4 breaths / minute).3. Your brain's dopamine system (the short-term reward center) is the root of most willpower problems because, for survival reasons, you are hard wired to prefer an immediate reward in front of you, like a burger, over a long term reward, like good heart health. You can get around this by delaying the short term reward for 10 minutes, and then using that time to compare the 2 competing rewards objectively, without interference from your brain's powerful short-term reward system.4. Over time, is paradoxically far easier to resist temptations if you DON'T try to repress them, but instead actually focus on them until they go away by themselves. Many studies have proven this counter-intuitive finding. I absolutely recommend this book -- not so much for its practical benefits, although those are great -- but more for the intrinsic value of knowing yourself."
6,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1202719-sasha,4,"This book is immensely valuable, and very much needed by most people. It isn't even that the book itself is so fantastic, though it is definitely a good book, clearly written, good ideas, well executed. The topic matter is so absolutely pertinent that a thorough and adequate treatment of the subject automatically becomes enormously helpful.It's somewhere in between a readable review of the science, and a well structured self help book. In terms of the order of the chapters, there are a few fairly essential subjects--chapter 6 on self-compassion and healthy pessimism and chapter 9 on acceptance of difficult feelings, I believe--that I think would be of more value in an earlier part of the book, if the reader takes the approach which the author recommends, which is to pick a goal or 'willpower challenge,' read one chapter per week, and gradually work on that challenge.On the other hand, because her chapter summaries and short description of exercises are so short and well written, you can easily ignore her advice, read the book quickly, and return to those summaries and exercises once a week--perhaps even re-ordering them.An issue is that, as the author says, basically willpower is tiring. One thing she doesn't go into is that what should begin with willpower should turn into habit--because habit is not tiring. Exercising our 'willpower muscle' is important, but knowing how to transition changes from choices into habits is at least as important, so that we can move on to new willpower challenges. With that in mind, I strongly recommend that this book is read together with Part I and the appendix of ""Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg. (Parts II and III are about group habits and may not be very relevant to individuals.)Which book to read first? If you're going to tear through The Willpower Instinct in a few days, then return to the summaries and exercises in order to apply what you've learned, I think it would be best to read The Willpower Instinct first, while deciding what your challenge is going to be. Then, as you're applying her exercises, read The Power of Habit, Part I and the appendix."
7,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7705225-mike-tiernan,3,"McGonigal brings together the newest insights about self-control from psychology, economics, neuroscience and medicine to build willpower. She is a health psychologist at Stanford School of Medicine where she teaches a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" that quickly became the most popular classes ever offered by Stanford. Course evaluations call the course ""life-changing"".The book's 10 chapters reflect her 10-week course, written in an interesting and easy style, without any ""academic pompousness"":1. effective willpower - just noticing what's happening is key2. the willpower instinct - anything that puts a stress on your mind or body can sabotage self-control but too much willpower is stressful3. self-control is like a muscle - it gets tired from use but regular exercise makes it stronger4. why being good encourages bad behavior - we use past good behavior to justify indulgences5. why we mistake wanting for happiness - even false promises of reward make us feel alert and captivated, so we chase satisfaction from things that don't deliver6. how feeling bad leads to giving in - self-compassion is a far better strategy than beating ourselves up7. we discount both future rewards and future costs - we consistently act against our own long-term interests and we illogically believe our future selves will (magically) have more willpower8. why willpower is contagious - humans are hardwired to connect and we mimic and mirror both willpower failures and willpower successes of our social network9. inner acceptance improves outer control - attempts to fight instincts and desires ironically make them worse10. final thoughts - the aha momentEach chapter makes use of fascinating paradoxes to dispel common misconceptions about self-control. This book is way ahead of any others I've read on the subject, for its wide range of down-to-earth and practical strategies for greater success."
8,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,4,"I thought I had promised myself: No more self-help books about procrastination. Unfortunately, when it comes to books, I have no willpower! haha! Fortunately, this book is totally different from all those other worthless books I've read. There are lots of interesting scientific experiments, mostly on humans (except the one rat study was terrible and I really wish it wasn't stuck in my brain :( ). The book starts out with very basic advice, eat better, get better sleep, get some exercise and start meditating. And it goes on from there. I actually took a few pages of notes in my journal, which is an indication of how much I was inspired by the book. I will definitely be re-reading it soon."

Filled with tons of knowledge.*Still need to edit these notes but here's the raw version:NOTES*INTRODUCTIONThis book is based on a Stanford classPeople cite lack of Willpower (WP) as one of the number one things holding them backThe best way to improve self control (SC) is to see/understand why you lose controlBeing overly optimistic is bad because you cannot objectively judge your own flaws and predict times of difficultyTrue/Honest self knowledge is the foundation of good self controlStruggles with WP are part of the human condition and in order to get more of it, you need to study yourself, experiment, and test the theories out.There are 2 types of challenges (with a bonus 3rd)I will challenges (things that you normally put off/ignore, like studying or running), I won’t challenges (refraining from negative activity like not spending money or not eating fast foods), and I want challenges.CHAPTER ONE: I WILL, I WON’T, I WANT: WHAT WILLPOWER IS, AND WHY IT MATTERSI will and I won’t are the two sides of self controlHowever, you need a 3rd thing: you have to know what you really wantAs the world and society became more complex the demands of WP grewStrong WP = Good lifeStatistically, WP is one of the best (if not best) determinants of successCertain states mimic prefrontal cortex damage like being drunk, sleep deprived, highly distractedThe Problem of Two MindsThe system of self control was put on top of old systems, it didn’t actually replace themWe still have all of our ancient cravings/impulsesWe have impulse and impulse controlAlmost like having two mindsThe Value of Both SelvesYes, the primitive impulse self can be frustratingHowever, it is still critical todayIn some cases it works with the prefrontal cortexeg. High prices can stimulate a pain response, making one less likely to overspendTHE FIRST RULE OF WP: KNOW THYSELFSelf awareness lets you recognize when you need WP because most decisions stem from habit, so awareness lets us avoid that when necessaryDistraction really hurts WP  since you lose your self awareness You can train WP physically through meditationStart with 5 minutes a day. A short practice every day is much better than a long practice every once in awhile.Being bad at meditation is good for self controlWhen you are bad at meditation your mind will wander A LOTThat skill translates directly into WPYou notice you are off goal and then spend a lot of time redirecting it back to the present momentDon’t be worried when you struggle, the struggle will improve your WPWP is a battle that can only be won through self-awareness and self-controlCHAPTER TWO: THE WILLPOWER INSTINCT: YOUR BODY WAS BORN TO RESIST CHEESECAKECraving is as much a physiological event as it is a psychological eventCertain physical states can help/hurt youLearning those states will be helpfulWP is all about planning for tomorrow... so we can see why the fight or flight response causes problems“We’re used to seeing temptation and trouble outside of ourselves: the dangerous doughnut, the sinful cigarette, the enticing internet.  But self-control points the mirror back at ourselves, and our inner world of thoughts, desires, emotions, and impulses.  For your willpower challenge, identify the inner impulse that needs to be restrained. Next time you’re tempted, turn your attention inward.""The Willpower Instinct: Pause and PlanWillpower has a biological signatureIt’s like the fight or flight (FoF) response, but very differentUnlike FoF, it is triggered by internal conflict/threatsIn a nutshell, it slows your mind downThis is Your Brain and Body on WillpowerPause and plan (P+P)Monitoring system dispersed throughout brain and connected to prefrontal cortexConstantly monitors thoughts, emotion, and stimulusIf sees things that suggest break with longer term goals, system is activatedPrefrontal cortex is stimulatedEnergy is redirected from the body to the brainHeart slowsBreathing deepensMuscles loosenAll these things physiologically prime you to exercise willpowerThis system is innate to all people, just like fight or flight, but it doesn’t always feel like thatIt is also a much newer systemThe Body’s Willpower ReserveStudies have shown that the best predictor of the strength of someone’s P+P response is their HEART RATE VARIABILITYEssentially, everyone’s heart rate tends to vary from moment to momentThese are small but safe fluctuationsThe greater the variability, the greater the willpowerThe sympathetic nervous system stimulates and “revs” the bodyThis increases heart rate and decreases variabilityThe parasympathetic nervous system puts the breaks onThis decreases heart rate and increases variabilityStress -> Sympathetic nervous system -> low variabilitySelf control -> Parasympathetic nervous system -> high variabilityWhen people use WP, their variability goes upSo what actually causes high variability?Good food, rest, meditation, low pollution, etc. all improve variabilityA calm mind is a WP mindExperiment: Breathe Your Way to Self ControlThis is a “quick” fix that will help give you the edge in your WP struggles.  When facing a WP challenge, slow your breathing to 4-6 breaths per minute.  This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, increases heart variability, and in the end will give you a WP boost.Train  Your Mind and BodyWhat follows are two strategies that will give you absolutely the most bang for your buck in regards to improving WPAlso they will help with general health and happiness.The Willpower MiracleMegan Oaten and Ken Cheng conducted a study on a technique for improving WPAt the end of the treatment here is what happened to the subjects:Improved attention span, improved ability to tune out distraction, less smoking, drinking, caffeine, junk food, healthy food, TV, procrastination, etc.So, what was this miracle drug?Physical exercise.Exercise helps in pretty much every aspect of your lifeHeart variability shoots ups with fitnessMore gray and white matter throughout the brainMost increases in the prefrontal cortexIn some cases as powerful as prozac for depressionWILLPOWER EXPERIMENT: THE FIVE MINUTE GREEN WILLPOWER FILL-UPFeeling like you need a quick dose of more WP?  Get outside for just five minutes and move around.  This will help give you a quick willpower “fill-up”.  If that outside is green space, the effect is greater.  It doesn’t have to be a mega workout. In the long run, exercise will give you much more energy and power than it takes away.Gain Willpower in Your SleepIf you are surviving on less than 6 hours of sleep a night, you probably don’t even know what it is like to operate with full WPSleep deprivation absolutely murders WPUnder 6 hours chronically is really badSleep deprivationImpairs the brain’s ability to use glucoseTriggers sugar or caffeine cravingsBut even if you eat it, the craving will persist because the brain can’t actually use the glucose in the blood efficientlyHits the prefrontal cortex harder than anything else, as it is the most energy intensive part of the brainClinically called “Mild prefrontal dysfunction”With an impaired prefrontal cortex, all of your brain regulation begins to falterAlarm system and fight or flight are no longer kept properly in checkOrdinary stress will trigger fight or flight, and you will be stuck in a permanent physiological mild fight or flight responseFortunately, all of this is easily reversableJust sleep more!Experiment: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZThe best is obviously 8 hours a night, but that isn’t alway possible.  A single good night can help reverse multiple bad ones, so if you are busy during the week catch up on the weekend.  Some studies suggest you can build up a reserve, so consider oversleeping if you know you are about to enter a hard stretch.  Finally, naps can do wonders by breaking up consecutive waking hours.  So the best is to actually get 8 hours, but if that fails consider catch up, stocking up, or napping.  If you find yourself avoiding sleep, consider what you are saying “yes” to instead of sleep.  Your WP issue may not be an “I will” go to sleep issue, but a “I won’t” browse Reddit after 10pm issue.  Consider what you have to say “no” to so you can say “yes” to sleep.The Cost of too Much Self-ControlStress is very costlyDiverts the body’s resources to a perceived emergencyBut obviously, some stress is also good!WP is also very costlyIt also uses the body’s resources aggressivelyChronic WP is just as bad as chronic stressSelf-control is a nifty evolved response to a specific set of circumstances, just like stress isTo preserve health and happiness, you need to give up your pursuit of WP perfectionYou need time off, and you need to choose your WP battles wiselyExperiment: Relax to Restore WP ReserveRelaxation is very important.  So, here is a technique that activates the physiological relaxation response for 5-10 minutes.Lie on your backElevate your legs slightly, or do what is most comfortable.Close your eyes and take deep breathsFocus on your bodyIf you feel tension in any muscle, contract that muscle tightly for a few seconds then relax itRepeat for all tension in bodyThen just chill for 5-10 minutes in the knowledge that for these 5-10 minutes there is nothing you have to do besides relax and enjoy yourself :)If worried about falling asleep, set an alarm (A peaceful one!)Do this every day if you are able.  It will both reduce your stress and increase your WP.One Nation Under StressWillpower isn’t a personality trait or a virtueIt is a physical capacity and an instinctYou don’t always get to just make your mind up about itStress always harms one’s willpowerDon’t increase stress in yourself or others to get things doneBiologically, stress and willpower are incompatible and antagonistic systemsPeople say the United States has lost its willpower“This week, test the theory that stress- whether physical or psychological- is the enemy of self-control.  How does being worried or overworked affect your choices?  Does being hungry or tired drain your WP?  What about physical pain and illness?  Or emotions like anger, loneliness, or sadness?  Notice when stress strikes throughout the day or week.  Then watch what happens to your self control.  Do you experience cravings?  Lose your temper?  Put off things you know you should do?”The last wordWP is an evolved mental instinct that initially promoted healthy group dynamicsWP failures can often be traced to being in the wrong physical state to properly exercise WPWaging the mental WP war will be hard if you are not physically prepared to do itCHAPTER THREE: TOO TIRED TO RESIST: WHY SELF-CONTROL IS LIKE A MUSCLESelf control is like a muscleBut... it isn’t just using self control that can exhaust WPAny pause and plan action drains itThe more one uses WP the less active the prefrontal cortex becomes over a short time frameIs it a problem of energy?In part, yesLow blood sugar is a strong predictor of WP failureHowever, WP uses less raw glucose energy than a task like walking, so if you are walking then it isn’t just energyEnergy CrisisBrain has a very low energy storage capacityTherefore, very dependent on blood for energyIf the brain detects a drop in blood sugar, it will start to cut back on energy consumption, and the prefrontal cortex gets cut very earlySo even if you can walk, your prefrontal cortex may still be restricted“Energy Budget” model for self controlIn general your body will spend energy when it is plentiful, and conserve it when it is notMore subtly it looks at the change in energySo increasing blood sugar, more WPDecreasing blood sugar, less WPPeople Who are Starving Shouldn’t say No to a SnackSo the above may seem a bit frustrating, but consider ancient scarcityIt makes sense for the brain to do the aboveLow blood sugar = scarce resourcesTime to take risks and be impulsiveThe future doesn’t really matter as muchThe problem is that low blood sugar still pushes people to make risky and impulsive decisionseg. People on diets commit adultery at measurably higher ratesExperiment: The WP DietSugar spikes are not the answer to the above problem.  Spikes lead to massive drops later, and that means massive drops in WP.  A smooth and even supply of sugar is the best option in regards to WP.  This means focussing on foods that are low on the glycemic index.  Consult a dedicated dieting resource, but here are some low glycemic foods: lean proteins, nuts and beans, high-fiber grains and cereals, and most fruits and vegetables.  A decent rule of thumb is if it looks like it’s in its natural state (not much post processing) it is probably low on the index.  Now, it will take SC adn WP to switch to these healthier foods, but they will give you increased returns given the even and steady blood sugar.  Consider them a WP investment like exercise.Training the WP MuscleCreate a WP exercise or challengeCreate and meet self imposed deadlinesFor example, clean a closet over timeThese will help in all aspects of your WP in the long runSmall WP tasks (maintaining good posture, tracking spending, etc.) are also great for WP exerciseAll of the above train you to notice your actions and then do the more difficult thing, and that is fundamentally what WP is all aboutExperiment: A Willpower WorkoutStrengthen “I won’t”Commit to refraining from one trivial activity: don’t swear, don’t cross legs when sitting, don’t slouch, don’t use dominant hand to open certain doorsStrengthen “I will”Commit to one small habit that you will do every day: meditate, call a family member, throw one old thing outStrengthen Self monitoringFormally track something you don’t normally track.  Calories, spending, time spent online, whatever works.  A pen and paper is enough, but there are tons of self tracking tools out there.  Scope out www.quantifiedself.com if you really want to get into it.  Pick it and stick to it.Try to pick a workout that relates to your main challenge.  So, if you want to save money, track your spending habits.  If you want to exercise more, consider just doing 10 quick push ups before you shower.  Even if you can’t make it relate directly, you will still be improving your WP.Another way these exercises can come in handy is by easing you into truly massive WP challenges.  Consider quitting smoking after a really heavy habit.  If you can refrain from smoking for just some brief period for a work out, that will help in the long run.How real are the limits of self control?When WP “runs out” is that just because exercising WP is getting hard or is that really a physical barrier?To find out, let’s look at real musclesMaking the Finish LineConsider the marathoner who “pushes through” fatigueScientists used to think that when most runners stopped from fatigue or exhaustion, they had hit a real physical barrierHowever, when they examined the muscles of most exhausted runners, they were physically still capable of running for quite some timeFatigue was in the mind (In most cases!)The brain uses fatigue as a trick to make you stop runningIt doesn’t want you to hit true exhaustion, so stops you with “gas still in the tank”You will get the mental sensation of fatigue long before you are actually physically fatiguedFatigue is literally in the mindIt’s closer to an emotion than a physical sense of where your body is atThe first wave of fatigue isn’t a real physical limitThis doesn’t mean you can’t hit true exhaustion, you can, but it comes much later than you thinkTruly good athletes learn to ignore the first waves of fatigue and push onIf it was actually a physical limit, they couldn’t push onSo why do we care about this?Some theorize that WP is like thisWhen we feel drained, we really aren’t yet drainedWhen you feel WP exhaustion, know that it isn’t a true physical boundary, and you can keep goingThose who believe that WP exhaustion isn’t a “true” representation of their physical mental reserves don’t tire as quickly due to WP useThey just keep on pushingWhat a person believe about WP is their reality.Therefore, whenever you feel WP exhaustion, just keep pushingIt is just like early physical fatigue, and can be ignoredMicroscope: Is your exhaustion real?When you feel that first moment of “I want to give up” or other WP exhaustion, move past it.  It can be ignored and pushed through in a manner similar to physical fatigue.  However, be aware of feeling constantly drained.  If you always feel drained of WP, you may have hit a real limit for the time being.  However, even those limits can be increased with time and mental exercise.Where There’s a Want, There’s a WillCorrect inspiration = more willpowerConsider some delicious girl scout cookiesTempting, right?Now imagine someone will pay you $100 to not eat a single oneNot so tempting nowWhat you want will affect your WPSo, incentives can workHere is one incentive that can apply to everyone who is exercising their WPPractice will make things easierWhat is hard and takes a lot of WP now will become easier and maybe even second nature in timeAs you exercise your WP, things will get easierIt is a positive feedback loop that can and will bring you a better life if you stick to itExperiment: What’s Your “Want” PowerWhen your WP is getting low, tap into your want power.  Consider:Think of how you will benefit from completing this

Decided to listen to the audio book which normally I don't find very easy to focus on but with this one I didn't have any problems. Although I was already familiar with some of the concepts mentioned here still learned a lot especially on understanding how one can strengthen will power. Definitely check out this book if you're interested to find out why our mind craves so many things that are unhealthy in the long run.
11,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,1,"Expectations: an informative and reliable, yet readable non-fiction book about willpower by a Stanford professor.Reality: lame jokes, some questionable science, and a bunch of pretty dumb-sounding statements I would be comfortable hearing from my grandma in the kitchen, but not from a Stanford professor in a non-fiction book. What Kelly McGonigal did here to me felt so unscientific as to be borderline anti-scientific. THE BADMe, reading The Willpower Instinct: Oh, boy, The Willpower Instinct was not for me. SCIENCE? Okay, I know this is the THIRD time I'm mentioning this in my review, but: I don't understand how a STANFORD PROFESSOR can seriously and REPEATEDLY do this:1) discuss a study with whole 24 human participants for half a chapter as if it's completely legit and nothing calls for caution when using its results;2) cite dozens of studies and yada yada through the specifics: After two months of the treatment, they showed improvements in attention and the ability to ignore distractions.This added one hour a night to their quality sleep time, which in turn significantly reduced the risk of drug use relapse.Huh? How big were the improvements? What exactly was improved? How ""significantly"" was the risk reduced? She did this ALL THE TIME and it drove me crazy. What's the point of citing studies if you do it like this? Instead of giving us the data, she just gave her own assessment of it, and given her loss of credibility, it was just irritating and insubstantial. Most of the time she forgot to mention sample sizes, the parameters that were ""improved"", the method of measuring said improvement, and the size of it, too. UGH. Life's too short to provide those details, but there was enough space to include a whole chapter on the debunked ""marshmallow test"" and a 100th rendition of the story of Phineas Gage.3) support the merits of a breathing exercise by mentioning one dude found it helpful to ""make better decisions under pressure"". What are ""better"" decisions? Why is he the judge of them being better? Who is this dude anyway and why does his private opinion matter? If the benefits of an exercise have not been studied or measured, okay. But be upfront about it - no need to bullshit me with TV-advert style reasoning to support it instead.4) cite a study; interpret its results in a way that's convenient to the point she is trying to make; pretend this is the only interpretation and the true reason behind such results The chimpanzees expressed a preference (six M&Ms is better than two) and then acted on it. They maximized their gains with very little personal cost (a mere 120 seconds’ delay). The humans’ choices, on the other hand, were irrational. Before the challenge began, they clearly stated that they preferred six treats to two. But as soon as they had to wait two minutes to triple their snacks, their preferences reversed more than 80 percent of the time. They deprived themselves of what they really wanted for the fleeting satisfaction of a quick fix.Kelly McGonigal then goes on to lament how humans are dumber than chimps. But I have a few questions here. What exactly were these people asked and how did they express their preference? A number of things could have happened. One, they could have said that generally speaking, 2 is better than 6, but didn't mean it as a personal preference. Maybe they don't like M&Ms, have recently eaten something sweet or think eating more sweets is unhealthy. Two, there's a major difference between humans and chimps in this situation: people can easily get as many M&Ms as they want at any time and they know it. There's no scarcity, so there's no need for willpower. Chimps can't do that. This is exactly the reason why ""the marshmallow test"" was debunked. This seems to me like the most obvious and likely explanation for such a result, but McGonigal mopes the human's inferior willpower for an entire chapter without mentioning any other possibilities. This enraged me so much!A 2010 national survey by the American Psychological Association found that 75 percent of people in the United States experience high levels of stress. It’s not surprising, given the events of the last decade, from terrorist attacks and flu epidemics to environmental disasters, natural disasters, unemployment, and near economic collapse.It's not a surprising result, because if you ask Americans if they are stressed, of course, they'll say they are. The terrorist attacks, which accounted for less than 0.01% of deaths and 35.6% of media coverage, have little to do with that. But McGonigal assumes no critical thinking in her readers and just bullshits away! HUMOR? A simple fact: the author made a lot of jokes in this book. I found none of them funny, on the contrary, they got on my nerves, seemed lame and ""trying too hard"". So their abundance really made reading The Willpower Instinct a chore. To give you an example, these are taken from a chapter on how and why willpower was formed in humans:Imagine this: It is 100,000 years ago, and you are a top-of-the-line homo sapiens of the most recently evolved variety. Yes, take a moment to get excited about your opposable thumbs, erect spine, and hyoid bone (which allows you to produce some kind of speech, though I’ll be damned if I know what it sounds like).... think twice before saying “That loincloth makes you look fat.”... cutting-edge stone tools.... to care for you if you get sick or injured—no more hunting and gathering for you.... minding your own early hominid business. Major cringe. I guess she tried to make this book light and entertaining, but I don't find anthropology so boring as to require stupid puns in every other sentence. PLAIN NONSENSE. I know this book isn't an academic work. But when a professor uses scientific terms, I expect them to be used appropriately, and not like this:Evolution prefers to add on to what it’s created, rather than start from scratch.... the following meditation technique will get the blood rushing to your prefrontal cortex—the closest we can get to speeding up evolution.Willpower is a biological instinct, like stress, that evolved to help us protect ourselves from ourselves.... we’ve seen that the human mind is not one unified self, but multiple selves who compete for control. There’s the self who wants immediate gratification and the self who remembers your bigger goals. There’s your present self, who may or may not seem to have much in common with your future self. As if that weren’t a crowded enough crew, it turns out that you have a few other people living in your head too.She writes this stuff as if the words ""evolution"", ""instinct"", ""stress"", ""self"" have no actual meaning. Stress is a response, not an instinct. Yes, evolution is about evolving, not building from scratch, genius. No, evolution can't be sped up within the lifespan of a single individual. And don't get me started on this ""multiple selves"" stuff. Neuroeconomists—scientists who study what the brain does when we make decisions—have discovered that the self-control system and our survival instincts don’t always conflict. In some cases, they cooperate to help us make good decisions. THE GOODSome ideas were interesting, I guess?Verdict: a waste of time. Garbage. The execution killed the book completely. I've read so many good, interesting and fun non-fiction books that reading this one felt intolerable."
12,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26683448-mohammed-h,5,"Thank you for taking the time to read my reviewI believe we all have willpower, some of us rely on it and make it stronger some of us don't know how! Its crazy to think of it as a muscle! But thats what it really is! This book looks at willpower from a scientific point of view and how it evolved with our brains. It shows you ways of strengthening your willpower. It also shows you how your brain plays tricks on you to make you do things you don't necessarily want to do. If you cannot complete a diet, or quite smoking or stop drinking, or cannot find your willpower, this book is for you. I got this book on audiobooks but I believe that having a hard copy of this book is more useful as it has exercise at the end of every chapter and a summery to help you accomplish certain goals.What I found most interesting about this book is the subject on Dopamine! It looks how dopamine effects us and how it is used by todays marketers! I think you will find this true once you scientifically understand how it effects our brains. "
13,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"**Putting down the book presented a willpower challenge**Speaking of willpower, once I started reading this book, it took every ounce of my willpower to put it down! (And, so yeah, I may have been spotted reading this book in my car while while sitting at red lights. My apologies to the drivers behind me for any [slight] delays my willpower challenges may have caused.) As the above evidence suggests, I can't rave enough about this book. It's a gem, it's a god-sent, and it's just that good. You'll have to read for yourself to see what all this gushing is about, but for now, here's a small sampling in the form of the titles' chapters with the author Kelly's big idea summary of each: ***Chapter 1: I Will, I Won't, I Want—What Willpower Is, and Why It Matters Willpower is actually three powers—I will, I won't, and I want—that help us to be a better version of ourselves. ***Chapter 2: The Willpower Instinct—Your Body Was Born to Resist CheesecakeWillpower is a biological instinct, like stress, that evolved to help protect ourselves from ourselves. ***Chapter 3: Too Tired to Resist—Why Self-Control Is Like a MuscleSelf-control is like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger.***Chapter 4: License to Sin—Why Being Good Gives Us Permission to Be BadWhen we turn willpower challenges into measures of moral worth, being good gives us permission to be bad. For better self-control, forget virtue, and focus on goals and values.***Chapter 5:The Brain's Big Lie—Why We Mistake Wanting for HappinessOur brains mistake the promise of reward for a guarantee of happiness, so we chase satisfaction from things that do not deliver. ***Chapter 6: What the Hell—How Feeling Bad Leads Us to Giving InFeeling bad leads to giving in, and dropping guilt makes you stronger. ***Chapter 7: Putting the Future on Sale—The Economics of Instant Gratification Our inability to see the future clearly leads us into temptation and procrastination. ***Chapter 8: Infected!-—Why Willpower is Contagious Self-control is influenced by social proof, making both willpower and temptation contagious. ***Chapter 9: Don't Read This Chapter—The Limits of “I Won't” PowerTrying to suppress thoughts, emotions, and cravings backfires and makes you feel more likely to think, feel, or do the thing you most want to avoid. ***Chapter 10: Final Thoughts If there is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to one thing: the power of paying attention...Self-awareness is the one “self” you can always count on to help you do what is difficult, and what matters most. Needless to say, I was enthralled and captivated throughout this book. Kelly's down-to-earth delivery of the essential insights of psychology, biology, neuroscience, and economics is beyond out-of-this-world. But, she doesn't just share the findings; she provides ways for you to see and do for yourself. Sprinkled throughout her discussions are “Under the Microscope” and “Willpower Experiment” features of this book which provide many personalized opportunities for gaining self-awareness and experimenting with new strategies to help you address your own willpower challenges—be it over-eating, over-drinking, over-spending, over-thinking, over-indulging, over-Facebooking, under-doing, or perhaps even over-reading at red lights. In the introduction, Kelly shares her hopes that: “If this book did nothing else but help you see that common humanity of your willpower struggles, I would be happy. But I hope that it will do far more, and that the strategies in this book will empower you to make real and lasting changes in your life....By the time you finish this book, you'll have greater insight into your challenges and a new set of self-control strategies to support you.” And, indeed she delivers on that hope. Reading this book provides the insight you need to understand—and more importantly, have compassion for—your personal challenges, along with the techniques, tools, and perspective makeovers you need to gain more of that seemingly elusive self-control. Now, how can you resist that? (Just look out for green lights while reading.) "

I read it back to back after The Power of Habit, and it reinforced and backed up most of the important lessons.Takeaways: * Willpower is a limited, muscle-like resource (I postponed all tough things except one) * Train with small tasks (I'm flossing teeth and keeping a daily diary) * Meditate and exercise to boost willpower (requires some willpower capital first) * Willpower works better with little variation. If you start doing things, do it as consistently as possible (I'm flossing and keeping a diary at exactly the same moment in the day) * Avoid temptation makes you more likely to fail. Embrace and channel it through you.I'd recommend this one over The Power of Habit because of more actual science and no endless anecdotes. This is a self-help book without the self-help stench."

McGonigal repeats her accomplishments so many times ! Which had no relevance to this book !I laughed to myself several times .. ... 
16,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33880676-laura-sandonato,5,"I got a lot out of this book. At the beginning, I was a little concerned by the early mention of mindfulness. I am on board with the idea of mindfulness, but I wasn't interested in reading another book about it. Luckily, I stuck with it and learned so much. 'The Willpower Instinct' gave me the permission I needed to give myself a break. I liked what the author had to say about mindfulness but also appreciated the other ""tricks"" you can try to give yourself more willpower. I was also surprised by her criticism of CBT. Apparently, by forcing ourselves to change our thoughts we give them more power. I liked that bit since CBT never helped me, and the tips in that chapter have already helped me deal with my habit of worrying. Finally, the book was well organized and easy to understand and apply. That's important since the book is science heavy. It was nice to read a self-help book containing claims backed up by science."

19,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"Take my rating with a grain of salt: I’ve read this book, but haven’t really taken the time to put its advice into practice yet.This book is a useful combination of popular science/psychology and self-help, looking at why our brains work the way they do and how to get better at putting big-picture goals ahead of short-term urges. There’s a fair amount of science and studies in it, explained in an accessible way, along with practical tips and strategies for everyday life.There’s a lot of useful information here, in terms of both general information about human psychology and things that might help you make positive changes in your own life. And it’s actually enough information to justify a book, not just a magazine article stretched out to book length with lots of anecdotes (there are a few anecdotes sprinkled throughout, but they don’t dominate the pages). The author suggests reading one chapter per week – the book’s genesis is in a ten-week college course – which I mostly did, but which didn’t ultimately help me much. Some of the topics resonated (like the one about why our brains trick us into turning to counterproductive behaviors like snacking or Internet surfing to relieve stress, even though these are actually among the least effective stress relievers), while others seemed less relevant to my life. Also, the “homework” from the first chapter is to meditate for five minutes every day, which I did not do (yes, yes, everyone recommends meditation to solve all ills, but actually doing it really sucks) and which perhaps set the tone for not doing the rest of the “assignments.”At any rate, I think this is a good book to read if you want to make changes in your life. With the caveat that you should probably read it when you have the bandwidth to put some time and energy into making those changes, because while simply reading a book can make you more aware of some things, it probably isn’t going to break a bad habit or instill a good one all on its own. I do plan to come back to it at another time.Also, yes, the author is Professor McGonigal. Har, har."
20,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Lately, it has become very fashionable (particularly for neuro-sceensters) to bash the the outdated notion of free will. And for good reason. That shit is a fairy tale. It just plain doesn't exist. At least the hokey ol' folk psychology notion of ""uncaused"" behavior a.k.a. contra-causal free will. a.k.a. classical dualistic free will i.e. the belief that there is a component (call it a soul or what ever) to human behavior that is something more than the unavoidable consequences of the genetic and environmental history of the individual and the possible stochastic laws of nature..............Every event (including human behavior) has a natural cause (of some sort or another), and there's no such thing as ghosts, so please get over it, it's 2013 for fux sake.That being said, it is pretty clear that people make choices, and the choices they make, make a difference. It's gonna take people smarter than myself to sort out all of the apparent contradictions and tangles inherent in this particular philosophical puzzle. So I'm not even going to try. And frankly, neither did the author of The Willpower Instinct (Kelly McGonigal), and I for one, think that's a very good thing.McGonigle does a decent job of revitalizing this decidedly uncool and very unfashionable topic, due in part to the fact that she kept that shit simple! Simple language, simple ideas, simple simple simple. I loved that about this book. Many people erroneously think that the answer to their problems will come from learning some complex theory or idea, and once they have the magical information, than their life will ""fall in to place"" with little to no effort. In my experience, the opposite is true. The information needed to understand most of life's challenges is typically quite simple and readily available. But the actual solutions are usually difficult and typically take some real effort. Willpower is one of those things. If you lack willpower, the explanation is not complex, McGonigal explains the issue quite easily, in very simple language. But actually changing that situation for yourself will require effort i.e. practice. Willpower is like any other psychological skill. It's like a muscle, it gets stronger with practice. It's not hard to understand, you just have to actually do it. McGonigle didnt exactly get creative with the format though (for better or worse). It's a standard formula for popular psychology books to (a) identify a problem that nearly everyone suffers from, (b) Identify all the ways that commonsense notions about the issue are wrong, (c) summarize the what the ""new"" science of ______ says about the subject, (d) bombard you with a litany of interventions and exercises, followed by (e) case study examples of dubious authenticity, and (f) copious research findings. Again, McGonigle doesn't even try to do it differently. She pretty much just did one of those. And it works pretty good. Cha Chunk - one pretty decent pop psych book, made to order, nothin fancy.WHERE THIS BOOK SHINES!McGonigle does do a particularly good job of describing how negative self evaluation can be deleterious to our willpower. According to McGonigle, self criticism and self castigation is counterproductive to adaptive behavioral change. Many people think they need to be ""hard on themselves"" in order to ""keep them selves in line"". But negative self talk (and the feelings and beliefs that accompany it) can actually keep people trapped in cycles of maladaptive, out of control behavior. For example: people who over eat to manage negative feelings may harshly self castigate, leading to enhanced negative feelings, which trigger more of the unwanted impulsive over eating behavior -and so on -and so on -and so on...I am currently working as a clinician in a addiction recovery program. Our clients come to us FULL of shame and self criticism. It's normal, it's natural, but it doesn't help them change the behavior. If shame worked for that, they wouldn't be addicts. Shame actually makes the problem worse because it makes them feel worse (see above) and it diverts attention from the real problem, making arriving at a reasonable solution pretty dang hard.One component of this phenomena is the Ironic Rebound Effect:This refers to when attempts at cognitive control/suppression backfire and result in increased incidents of the undesired cognitive content e.g. feelings, mental images, self talk etc. For example: after individuals attempt to disregard doubts about themselves, their self esteem actually declines and their anxiety rises (Borton, Markovitz, & Dieterich, 2005). Likewise, when individuals feel compelled to condemn some activity, such as a risky act, they are actually more likely to undertake that activity in the future (Maio & Olson, 1998).According to McGonigle, the intervention for ironic rebound effects is, simply put, to ""give up"". Let go of the agenda of cognitive control. Surf The Urge! In other words, allow yourself to have the problematic feelings or thoughts (or what ever), with equanimity, i.e. without resistance or self judgment, and (most importantly) without reflexively acting on them. From this platform of self acceptance, the individual can begin to gain insight into the actual triggers and mechanisms of the behavior, and make the needed adjustments necessary to retrain the maladaptive behavior. Self acceptance, however counterintuitive, can be the critical first step to exiting these kinds of behavioral traps. So there you go. The secret to willpower is giving up. Wait, what?Not so fast! There are plenty of instances where the agenda of cognitive change (cognitive restructuring) is effective. In my opinion, acceptance and mindfulness based approaches are best when offered in concert with traditional CBT. I like to say, you can change the cognitive content (traditional CBT) or you can change your relationship to the cognitive content (Mindfulness Based CBT). What ever works for you. It's just that most people are oversold on the agenda of cognitive change and under trained/educated on the agenda of acceptance. For me, it's all about embracing the dialectic of Acceptance and Change.SUMMARY: the ABC's of willpower are A: self care, B: self awareness and C: connecting with what matters most in life (i.e. values). The rest is simply a matter of practice."

I recommend this review for a succinct summary of the book.Keep in mind I found the first 25% of the book was waffly generic lead-up that I really didn't need. I was about to give up when suddenly all the useful good stuff began.Please note it did not take me 5 weeks to read because it was a boring book, rather that the author suggests you read a section and put it into practice for a week before you read the next section. I went just slightly faster than this, but it was still a paced approach that I found worked great."
22,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"Ok, I admit it. I am not going to be able to do this book justice: I read it in one of those ghastly self-destructive reading binges that find me struggling to keep my eyelids open at midnight, knowing that I'm going to be fucked for the morning, but driven on to turn the pages (even as I take Big Blinks) and extract every last nugget from the book. You probably won't experience this book in quite the same way, so I won't pretend that my experience is predictive of yours. (Unless you are a narcolept, in which case feel free to keep reading this review when you come to)""The Willpower Instinct"" comes from a course McGonigal taught at Stanford, over the course of which students were able to change their habits. Unlike the ""The Power of Habit"", which broke down habits into three basic phases and showed you how to reprogram yourself, this is more a grab-bag of techniques to explore over a few weeks and (on the course of the journey) learn what works for you. I have to admit that even though I know that ""going on a journey"" is the right way to change one's self, I still get frustrated with the idea that there's no quick fix. I lust for the quick fix. I am the King of the Demesne of The Quick Fix. I'm a programmer, my code is just a workaround for an empty file. Ok, we've established that I like quick fixes, let's move on.My biggest beef with the Willpower Instinct is that I never got the sense that there was a single consistent message about How We Work and What Works and How to Change and all that stuff. Instead there's a bunch of things that work for people and might work for you. Sometimes they felt contradictory, where small goals are good at one point but not another (I think that was the example: my copy is back in the library and I'm foolishly writing this review in retrospect so take with pillars of salt), and they never felt like they meshed well together. I'd love to see a ""Visible Learning"" type reduction of studies and efficacy to talk about what works and what doesn't.I've long wanted to improve my procrastination and general fuckuselessness. Somehow I seem to have managed that over the last six months: I've lost weight, I'm doing things that need to be done, and I'm generally more useful than I was before. I'm still reading these bloody self-help books, though! Perhaps that's the habit I should change ..."
23,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9800512-mark,2,"I think it's indisputable that the ultimate measure of the worth of a self-help book is... whether it helped. This book did not help me. If I'd hoped to acquire a great deal of rudimentary knowledge of psychology, neurophysiology, cognitive science, and the mechanics of meditation that I didn't already have -- then this book would have been an epic fail, because I already knew all of that, and knowing it had never in any imaginable way helped me before. If I'd been woefully and spectacularly ignorant of all these things to begin with, then I'd perhaps have emerged content that I'd learned a few stray facts through the medium of incessantly condescending pedagogical story-telling about sabertooth tigers and my fight-or-flight syndrome, but I remain convinced that it still wouldn't have changed my life. The author begins with a self-congratulatory account of how this inspired a multitude of continuing education students at Stanford to solve every conceivable problem in their lives, how it had been just the most popular course ever ever, and how every technique had been thoroughly beta-tested and debugged by legions of human guinea pigs so that the reader could embark on the venture with utter certitude of being imbued with all those numinous and wonderful ""I-will,"" ""I-won't"" and ""I-want"" powers they'd hitherto somehow utterly failed to acquire -- and certainly, conditioning someone to expect a benefit may help her to derive one, so let's give Dr. McGonical a pass on the rhapsodic self-promotion -- but the content just didn't deliver. Well... it didn't for me. Your mileage, of course, may be measured in kilometers or parsecs, so who knows? The mere effort of forcing yourself to read this may so inspire you never again to wish to be subjected to so tedious and fruitless an undertaking, that you'll suddenly develop immense self-control."
24,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54320432-ieva-gr,5,"Was it easy to read: Averagely so. It is a serious book, but written well and doesn’t burden the reader.What I liked about it: It seemed scientific enough to feel credible. I liked how each chapter was structured – some scientific facts, stories to illustrate them, questions to help notice similar things in your own life. The last words and summary at the end of each chapter was a great idea – I listened to the audiobook, so couldn’t make highlights. But then got back to the last part of each chapter and wrote down some things based on that.Overall I think the book really did help to notice patterns in my behaviour and willpower failures. What I disliked: Maybe dislike is a strong word for that, but the parts where the author was trying to be cute (things like “oh, I left you in the prehistoric days with the saber-toothed tiger, sorry for that, lets get back to present day”) made me sort of smile-cringe.Ideas/ Quotes:When we fail willpower challenges our mind and body is most likely in a bad state for self control e. g. suffering from chronic stress. Good tools to relieve it: exercise, reading, spending time with friends and family, walking, meditation, creative hobbies.We need to feel like the kind of person that wants to do the right thing – we shouldn’t frame our willpower challenges in moral terms. Otherwise being good will give us permission to be bad (self-indulgence shouldn’t be seen as reward)Trying to suppress thoughts backfires. Instead of suppressing thoughts we should allow ourselves to feel what we feel, but don’t believe everything we think. We should accept the thoughts but not necessarily act on them."

Studies show that taking time for relaxation every day can protect your health while also increasing your willpower reserve.p. 137 The most effective stress-relief strategies are exercising or playing sports, praying or attending a religious service, reading, listening to music, spending time with friends or family, getting a massage, going outside for a walk, meditating or doing yoga, and spending time with a creative hobby. (The least effective strategies are gambling, shopping, smoking, drinking, eating, playing video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV or movies for more than 2 hours.)p. 219 Feel what you feel, but don’t believe everything you think. The opposite of suppression is accepting the presence of the thought—-not believing it. You’re accepting that thoughts come and go, and that you can’t always control what thoughts come to mind. You don’t have to automatically accept the content of the thought. In other words, you might say to yourself, “Oh well, there’s that thought again—worries happen. That’s just the way the mind works, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything.”"

Throughout this book I had a recurring thought that the author has been listening to my thoughts for the past 20 years because the scenarios were so eerily spot-on.I have been employing the mechanisms taught by the author and I've never felt more in-control and calm about my decision making. I learned things like how I lie to myself and why those lies are so darn convincing. Most importantly, I learned how to overcome temptation in a practical, non-""hippy"" way. For example, this book mentions how we need to recognize how un-trustworthy we really are. We tend look to our future selves as someone more in-control and better than our present selves. ""Tomorrow I'll have a salad but not today"" is a bold-faced lie. If Today self doesn't want to eat a salad, then tomorrow self won't either, because they are both THE SAME FRIGGIN' PERSON. To avoid relapse, be totally honest with yourself. Realize that a burger today means a burger tomorrow. And the next day. And the next. That burger is not your friend, it is a threat. Eat somewhere else.We will use the past (I've been good today, I deserve a treat) and we will use the future (I'll work out tomorrow) and we will use the present (I'm too depressed, I need to cheer up) in order to have our way. This book points out every phase and what to do about it.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who struggles with willpower. So....yeah everybody. "
27,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34942670-eugene,5,"good and easy reading based on the series of lectures in Stanford Continuous Studies by the author. Great addition to ""Stranger to ourselves"" book. My highlights from the book: people are thinking about their future selves as about strangers so not making good predictions, before you react to a temptation make pause, wait for 10 minutes, try to switch to a breath. Also great to find references to researches that meditation is actually changes the blood flow inside the brain. There are lot of dilemmas in how our brain is working and it is a little bit outdated for the modern world. that is why understanding the psychological traps is important and the book is the very good work that with a very easy language explains all these things and how to walkaround them."
28,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19795539-michael-hughes,3,"2.5I cautiously recommend this book on the basis of its evidence-based advice for everyday failures of willpower, but it's hurt by an ingratiating, chummy prose style that I found condescending. I appreciate McGonigal's attempt to write a fun and approachable book, especially given the serious willpower challenges that some of her readers might have. But her breeziness evinces a lack of faith in the material, which is inherently interesting. Every page seems to feature a parenthetical nudge in the ribs or some other colloquial appeal meant to liven up the proceedings, but the effect is to lessen, not increase the enjoyment of reading. This is a book to be skimmed. "

At least that is what it feels like after reading this book. McGonigal goes over research on willpower and reveals the various traps we put ourselves in and why we find it so hard to keep certain goals and break certain habits.Each chapter outlines an area of research and gives several ideas on how to gain a better understanding about your own particular weaknesses and how to overcome them. This is not a typical ""self help"" book that promises you success if you follow a certain plan. Instead, McGonigal offers suggestions on how to face our inevitable failures and how to make it more likely that we will meet with success.The book is entertaining and easy to read. If there is a weakness, it is that McGonigal sometimes tries too hard to be humorous. There are notes in the back of the book that cite the research she employes, but sometimes it isn't easy to tell what research goes with which anecdote. These are minor caveats, though, to a very interesting book."

34,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55079025-f-d-gross,5,"This book has all the tools you need to understand what Willpower is and how to manipulate it. A profound read with mind-blowing revelations you never would have thought of. Each chapter delves a little deeper into the psychological aspects of the brain as you progress. It demonstrates how willpower is influenced or controlled. To work on one’s own willpower certainly has to come from the self, the desire needs to be had in order to unveil the truths within the facade that is our world, our time. It’s absurd what the norm is these days and how influenced the world can be when seeking out your own tribe, your own click, when it comes to social circles. I decided to read this book with some personal goals in mind and I can honestly say it has made a huge change in my life. It has unveiled the real truth in some instances and it is SCARY. Being a horror enthusiasts, I can say that what is covered in this book, the psychological truths of how our minds are easily manipulated by others, is ten times more scarier than any horror flick or book I’ve watched or read. But it has helped me with the ability to cope with certain cravings in life and I am grateful for being exposed to its secrets. As it states in the end of the book, the Ultimate truth to handling your own willpower is the simple idea of self-awareness. If everyone in the world read this book, the earth would be a better place...A hearty 5 out 5 stars. I recommend this book to anyone. F. D. Gross"

When I started this book, I was hoping there was a secret to how to suddenly have an iron will and I feel I should warn future readers that there isn't; willpower is a muscle that you need to flex in order to see improvements. As disappointed as I initially felt, I was quickly reassured by the many concrete steps to exercise this muscle that McGonigal presents in this book. Some of the steps for improving your willpower are a willpower challenge themselves: get enough sleep, exercise more, eat healthier. But there were plenty of others that are much more manageable to start, some are even just thought exercises: turning an ""I won't"" into an ""I will"", meditating 5 minutes a day, visualizing interacting with your future self, and embracing and even giving into cravings. I felt like I learned a lot and I walked away with some tips that have already started working, which is really exactly what I needed from this book.I would recommend to anyone who struggles with procrastination, exercise, weight control, or any other willpower struggle. Ultimately, the results are entirely on you, but this book provides concrete, easy-to-follow, and effective tips for increasing your self-control."
36,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15737214-fereshteh,5,Listened to this book on Audible and really enjoyed it. This book made me know myself better and helped me realize the reasons for my procrastinations. I feel like I should read this book or at least parts of it on a regular basis.
37,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20993440-daniel-ionson,5,"I'm combining the reviews for both the Baumeister/Tierney and McGonigal books into one because they are so similar (and both even reference each other). These were both important books for me. I detest ""self-help"" books for their fluff, but (like the rest of us) need external help to evolve. So, these were the perfect mix of reliable, empirical data and practical application for the strengthening of my own willpower. (I've pasted this from my website, which focuses on writers, but the principles apply to all.)----------------------------It’s because we have to live with ourselves, day-in/day-out, month following month, year stacking on year, that we cannot see our potential. We all feel that we “know ourselves”—our habits, our patterns, moods. But we’re wrong about a great number of things. Being so buried in our subjectivity, we cannot see that so many of the things we don’t like about ourselves/our lives are changeable.A core, governing element of changing is Willpower.The quickie-version: Willpower is not a static limitation; it is a muscle that we can build. We can become, with time, people with strong wills, people who are highly disciplined. And this means that we can become vastly superior artists (either in word, canvas, etc.) than we have been in the past.We are a species of habit—we have our routines, our thought patterns, eating patterns, on and on. We are reticent to go against the grain. If you come home each day, grab a beer and plop down in front of the TV, that habit has engrained itself in your brain to the point that doing something different is hard. And we can see this at work in any scenario where we have to deviate from our normal patterns. (This is one reason that holiday traveling is so exhausting.)The willpower muscle builds just like all other muscles—by exercising it. By forcing ourselves, little-by-little, to choose to do things that are new/hard, our willpower gets stronger.Here are a few highlights for developing willpower (based on Baumeister and McGonigal) -Take inventory of your habits and practices. (Observe how you spend your time “coasting by” in mindless bad habits.) -Start small. Don’t think that you can suddenly live the idealized, disciplined life, overnight. -Make lists. Write out both long-term and short-term goals for making the changes you want. -Willpower, like all muscles, gets tired when overused. Your willpower is weakest at the end of the day or at the end of situations which are taxing. -Therefore, don’t overstress your willpower. (Don’t depend on it at 11 pm to get you through a hard choice requiring discipline.) -Need some willpower right this minute? Eat some sugar. No joke. Glucose is shown to boost your willpower. (Yes, it’s ironic since most people think of willpower often in relation to avoiding sugar.) -Stress (negative stress as opposed to positive stress) and guilt are horrible for willpower. Don’t put unrealistic burdens on yourself, and never beat yourself up for your shortcomings. (And think about the vicious cycle this causes: You’re stressed because you need to get that chapter written. The stress slows you down. Then you feel guilty for failing at doing your writing, so you beat yourself up. It builds like an avalanche of failure.)This is a massive boon for the writer, for once we internalize the reality of our volition, we can shape new lives for ourselves that make us better and more productive. Nothing in our lives is truly compartmentalized (“Everything is everything…”). By becoming disciplined writers we can shape the elements in our lives that allow us to devote our energy to our craft. Writing is taxing. The emotional and mental energy that goes into it is heavy. But we can develop strength to match it. For example, we can structure our lives to minimize distractions. By taking care of business elsewhere, we can free up long chunks of time where we’re free to do nothing but writing. (And see this for more on being a disciplined artist.)We often feel like we’re merely passengers on the canoes of our lives, gliding with the current of this and that stream (our habits). But if we concentrate, if we focus our attention on our volitional power, we can see that we are not trapped. We can choose to grow and exert our wills. We need not just ""float along."" We can row with ever strengthening arms and backs. "
38,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83302298-narrative-muse,0,Read this if: You want to be inspired and enjoy exploring human behavior.The Willpower Instinct uses neuroscience to explain the exact behavior of your brain while making decisions. Author Kelly McGonigal is a health psychologist at Stanford School of Medicine where she became famous for having the most popular class at the University. She provides research-supported strategies on how to achieve goals while also focusing on self-compassion. Expect a lot more science than self-help. 
39,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71328393-patrick,5,"This quickly became one of my favorite nonfiction books. Not only is it put together well, but it has interesting, engaging, and useful information. I enjoy books on science most when there is a practical application, but I don't have much patience for disguised self-help books that claim to have ""the secret sauce that for some reason no one else knows about and totally is the key to solving all your problems and doesn't really have scientific basis, but you should totally trust me, because I have a published book."" Here, there's a good balance between science and application that's pretty much exactly what I look for. Each chapter examines a different aspect of the psychology of willpower, how it can work for or against us and why. The chapters are the perfect length, long enough to cover the relevant studies, findings, and mechanisms at work, but not so long that it drones on and on with redundancies. Since the subject of the book is willpower, something just about all of us would like to get more of, each chapter contains explorations and simple exercises you can try that apply the information in the chapter in ways that have been shown to improve willpower. Admittedly, some of these are fairly simple and intuitive (ie ""get 8 hours of sleep every night""), but there are some interesting things to try that are a bit less obvious and yet seemed to work for me. The book recommends reading one chapter per week to simulate the pacing of McGonigal's course on willpower, which gives her students a week to try out the new exercise to see how it works before moving on to another exercise. I tried this and I think it was a good way to experience the book as it did force me to try some of the exercises that I otherwise might've skipped over had I just read through the book in a few sittings. This also limits your variables so you have more of an idea of which exercises worked for you and which didn't.There's no ""one weird trick"" to getting more willpower. Even with the lessons of this book and applying all the exercises, you're still human, and you'll still struggle with willpower to some degree. Not surprisingly, there is no easy fix. That said, several of the lessons the book teaches are easy to apply and can be quite helpful. I also find that when I'm trying to apply some new principle or practice to my life, it helps if I have good epistemological basis for that addition. A book like this was perfect for me in that respect since it explained succinctly what the psychological hindrances are, then supplied methods for overcoming those hurdles. Whether you're trying to eat less, exercise more, spend less money, or make yourself write (which is what I'm procrastinating right now as I write this review), this book can tell you all about the human tendencies that might get in your way, as well as ways to fight back. If you're in the mood for an interesting read on psychology that might otherwise benefit you, or if you're tired of self-help gurus and are looking for something more substantiated, this is a great book."
40,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4722985-rob-thompson,5,"McGonigal defines willpower as ""the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it"", and says that humans experience conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, and the desire to procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this—McGonigal says—means taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with.The part of the self that enables us to act in a way that is consistent with our long-term goals is based in the prefrontal cortex, and McGonigal advocates body-mind practices that she says prioritize the function of the prefrontal cortex, rather than parts of the brain that are orientated toward instant responses, which is the brain's default setting when under stress.According to McGonigal, the practice of meditation is an effective way to establish the primacy of the prefrontal cortex, thus enabling a choice to do the harder thing, when that is required for attaining a long-term goal. McGonigal believes exercising self-control can help build up willpower in the same way as, over time, physical exercising can increase capacity to exercise. She says: ""If you do it with awareness and intention, it can make you stronger. The strength develops over time, even if you feel temporarily weaker. But I think this only works when you have this mindset, and feel like you are consciously choosing to “use” your willpower. If you feel like you are being drained by everything you “have” to do (or not do), that lack of autonomy is even more stressful than exercising self-control.""The promise of happiness from cravings often misleads in McGonigal's view, and she gives techniques of mindfully focusing attention on the actual experience when indulging a craving or temptation, so as to compare it with the expectation of reward that preceded it.One use of willpower that McGonigal sees as counter productive is thought suppression, or trying not think about temptations (such as cravings). McGonigal believes thoughts become more intrusive through thought suppression, and it is best to simply register that an unwanted thought has occurred without believing in it or acting on it. Energy to pursue activities is less scarce than to resisting temptation, says McGonigal, suggesting that people give their brains healthy ""wants"" such as vegetables or a walk after lunch, so that weight loss becomes a by-product of choice. Learning to be a friend and mentor to ourselves rather than equating self-control with self-criticism is the attitude that she advocates.Overall an excellent book. Highly recommended."
41,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3132060-andrea-james,5,"I re-read this book this week (I first read it about a year ago) and decided to give it five stars because second time around, I still found the writing style to be light and entertaining and more importantly, I've can now vouch that a bunch of the techniques suggested in the book have worked for me. I'm no willpower superhero but I'm getting more focused and able to stick to the things that I've set out to do. Many of the techniques in suggested in the book can be found elsewhere but I think they are nicely presented by the author.One of the things I like about the book is that the author calls the suggestions ""willpower experiments"" as opposed to something that sounds like set-in-stone advice, which a lot of self-help books tend to do. I approve of the spirit of learning of the book and its acknowledgment that our advice is almost always a work-in-progress. It's nice that the author recognises that we have to test, evaluate and possibly adapt suggestions to suit our lives and circumstances. The book has a nice balance of entertaining stories illustrating how we make decisions and practical suggestions on how we might manipulate our behaviour to get the desired results. If you think that a book with the title ""Maximum Willpower"" is going to be like a drill sergeant barking at you to be more disciplined and making you feel guilty about being such a weak failure for giving into the chocolate fudge cake yet again, you'll be relieved to know that it's quite the opposite. The book shows how counter-intuitive practices like self-forgiveness actually helps improve our long term results and that instead of fighting our cravings we should just accept them (but not act on them - a subtle but important difference that stops us from obsessing about what we can't have).If you are struggling with sticking with your diet or exercise plan, getting work done productively, or you're simply fighting with yourself, I'd recommend you give this book a go and see if it helps."
42,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984577-joseph-mcbee,4,"I really enjoyed this FASCINATING book.Who among us has never struggled with a lack of self-control? Whether it is in the area of diet and exercise, or getting rid of harmful habits, we have all wrestled with our ability to stop doing something we know is bad for us, or start doing something that is good. All of us are thrashing about in the waters of frustration in our personal and professional lives because we just don't have the willpower to get ""it"" done.That's where McGonigal's book comes in like a lifeboat.The subtitle of the book truly is an apt description of its contents: ""How self-control works, why it matters, and what you can do to get more of it."" This book is as practical as it is inspiring. Make no mistake though, this is not some pop psychology, self-help volume of ""be the ball"" mumbo-jumbo. This is a book loaded with science and quantified psychological and physiological experimentation with enough anecdotal evidence and light-hearted humor to make it a truly enjoyable read.Each chapter could stand on its own as something helpful but taken as a whole, this book could be downright life-altering. One of the things I enjoyed most as I read (and applied) the ideas in THE WILLPOWER INSTINCT is the small, very easy steps that the reader can take to increase personal willpower. When you take these steps and see success in your life, you come back to the book, hungry for more.This doesn't have to be a sit down and power through it kind of read. It's more of a dip in and out and go at your own pace sort of journey that carries readers along at a comfortable pace. It's a pace that the reader him or herself sets.If you are trying to lose weight, train for an athletic event, become more successful at work, rid yourself of toxic habits...heck, if you're HUMAN, you need to read this book."
43,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6410546-zhifei-ge,4,"I've read several books with the topic of positive psychology. They are intended to guide readers to reflect on our behavior or psychology and make changes. This book, about the willpower, is among them. Interestingly, I find most such books run similar pattern in arguments. First, authors ask readers to check their motivation. This usually serves to relate behavior with psychology. The authors usually can list a bunch of inspiring motives for readers to choose. The good authors are always good at hitting the point, and entice us to read on.Then, if the author is science in training. They will explain how neurology is related in thisprocess. They will probably how some psychological phenomena are related with the dopamine system, and things like that. Why do we need to talk about the science when things are seemingly behavior at all? Because physiology and psychology are interlocked. If we don't understand the limit or weakness of the physical bodies, we self-righteously assume that there is the omnipotent spirits that control our behaviors and they are not governed by physical laws. Eventually, they talk about how to make changes. At this stage, it's always easy to brainstorm solutions to our problems. Most of our unwanted behavior is irrational and unconscious. When we are conscious of them, these bad behavior will not happen at all. Some people do not like reading books on positive psychology, and they say these books require a high level of will power in the reader and thus won't work effective for them. I'd say, it's good enough to just know why we are doing this or that. If we know our motives, we have a truly free choice. Otherwise, we are just slaves of our unconscious minds. "

I got through it by reminding myself that I wasn't limited to just one bookmark, and could mark the experiment I was on and read ahead without missing anything. I will enjoy the re-read immensely, I think.Dr. McGonigal teaches a course at Stanford University called ""The Science of Willpower"", and if the class is half as engaging as this book, collecting the subject matter and lessons for a wider audience, her students are very lucky indeed. Presented in explanatory sections (I particularly liked the chapter that delved into the roll of dopamine in the processes of the brain), case studies of people putting the lessons to use, and practical exercises for the reader to try, the format created a recurring rhythm that encourages reader participation. McGonigal has a very engaging, conversational tone throughout the book, which only enhances the inviting nature of the content.The content itself is very helpful, providing an overview of the human brain, and reasons why our brains seem to be doing things that we don't quite approve of. She provides known ""traps"" for willpower, the ways that both our species inheritance and our modern (United States) world works for and against our willpower. Then she provides ways for us to work with those factors toward our reasoned goals and around our short-term impulses.As a habitual procrastinator, I found the whole work very enlightening.I received my copy of this book through the LibraryThing Early Reviewer's program. This review is cross-posted from LibraryThing."

46,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,5,"I thought ""The Power of Habit"" was really good, but now after I read ""The Willpower Instinct"" I realize that the former didn't go deep enough in analyzing and explaining the underlying reasons for our frequent inability to pick up good habits or get rid of bad ones. One could consider them as two different points of view on the same problem, and in certain ways the two books are complementary. ""The Willpower Instinct"" is much more useful though, from a practical point of view, as it offers a series of exercises and schemes to overcome willpower failure, something that ""The Power of Habit"" only alludes to briefly at the end of the book. Once a habit has been repeated often enough, it will become automatic and instinctive, as ""The Power of Habit"" explains, but only if we are able to create the conditions where we can repeat it with a sufficient frequency for a sufficient amount of time, which is the central focus of ""The Willpower Instinct""; not to mention, if the trigger or triggers for a particular habit are no longer present (something that could happen with any slight change in our environment), the habit instinct will likely fail, and that's when having more willpower to do what's necessary would come in handy."
47,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,5,"I typed 6 pages of reflections concerning the material presented in this fascinating book. I thought about trying to abridge what I wrote and shorten it into a lengthy review, but... sigh... I gave up. So yeah, I'll just write a brief blurb. I have lots of experience trying resist, escape and flee temptation and yeah, I also have given in countless times. A lack of self-control has been my Achilles heel and if a genie came out of a bottle, an infinite unfailing source of will-power would likely be among my three wishes. Lately i've been seeing how important and needed self-control our life, so it was a pleasure to come across this book. Since I am introspective and I regularly write down reflections from life, it was cool for me to read scientific evidence and social-experiments that go right along with my observations. But yeah, there was a lot that was also new for me and it's a book I want to revisit in hopes its content will become part of me. The book is packed with interesting information, she wasted no space with fluff. I highly recommend it. It really covers so much, so I won't even try to start, or else this review will turn into a book of its own"
48,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,5,"Generally, I am very apprehensive about self-help books but I would not categorize this one in that category. The book provides sound and rational explanation of complex and nuanced human behaviors governing our will power. The explanations are backed by scientific studies and followed up my very useful guidelines in coping with our own thought streams.Just a word of warning though, you would need some level of knowledge in Mindfulness in order to really benefit from this book."
49,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42446189-marie,4,"A very interesting and useful book about willpower and self-control that everybody should read. It is based on psychology experiments and the results are eye-opening. It is sometimes a bit lengthy and the concepts hard to grasp, despite real-life examples and the author's chatty style, but I thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to increase their willpower or interested in the workings of the mind."
50,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5140318-c-spencer-reynolds,3,"It was a good read and had some great points but nothing really stood out for me. Put it this way, I listened to this. As an audible program and I click on it again because I didn't remember even reading it. About 10 minutes in it hit me that I recognized a few of the examples and that was all I needed to move on to another book."
51,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2682712-rebecca,5,"So this took me forever because I wanted to go through it like the class form. After 3 tries I just read it straight through. So worth it. Everyone should read this book. It is amazing! I will definitely be re-reading this to use the tips. The take home, meditation and yoga can help transform your life. Already started with only 5 min meditation and it has helped so much. "
52,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"A strong compilation of the science of willpower but the author didn't explore societal consequences very deeply, so it felt like a more surface-level self-help book. Also, author refused to write a conclusion so the book felt unfinished. Even a simple summary of the information would have been better than just suddenly cutting off the book after her last topic."
53,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37219419-minwoo,5,"The mix of hard and social science, as well as the structure of the book made it stand out. I feel I can now notice various forces in play when it comes to willpower, or lack thereof, and have both tactical and theoretical responses. "

56,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74528212-rich-yavorsky,4,"It's ALL dopamine.I wrote a presentation that captures my notes on this book.Like her later book 'Upside of Stress', McGonigal's 'Willpower' provides practical advice--empirically supported--that you can immediately apply to your personal and professional life. Love Kelly McGonigal's work.Pocket notes (tl;dr) below._____Ch1 three minds i will i wont i wantPrefrontal cortex: Phineas GageLeft side of prefrontal persist. Right side resist. Center priorities and goals.Evolution builds on top of old mind.Give your old instinctual mind a name, and learn to recognize it when it appears.Recognize when the old mind comes up.Meditate to grow the frontal cortex. Changes like a muscle and is measurable. Pause and plan.Mediate to IMPROVE not perfect.Ch2: Sleep and exercise. So wildly important to willpower. Even small naps and 5 min walks. Heart rate variability is a great predictor.Sometimes willpower is about the won't not the will. E.g. sleep distraction.Ch3: limited willpower resource. Baumeister at FSU research. Those who diet, cheat on their spouses, etc.The limit is a mental illusion, driven by the differential of energy reserves. Sugar boosts help, but sustained energy is better. Brain behaves like a hoarding bank. Untested theory: willpower is a mental illusion too. Find the right will/won't. Don't be a 'wont scream' parent, be a 'happy enjoying parenthood' parent.Choice architecture: leads people to not think decision through. Checkout counters. Could be used for greater good if architected properly.Ch4: saints v sinnersMoral licensing. The more we attach 'good' and 'progress' towards actions, the more we are likely to give permission to sin 'what you really want' perspective shift: focus on seeing how 'committed' you are, not how 'good' you've behaved. Remember the WHY. Salad on the menu? You're more likely to indulge. Just the presence of a good option is enough to fool your mind into a vice license. People dismiss bad estimates as anomalies, them make WORSE promises! #projectmanagementCh5: The Reward System of the brain.McGill U Rats. Wired to 'promise of pleasure' center. Dopamine. Lee Seung Seop, 28yo died from playing Starcraft for 50 hours straight. Internet is like amphetamines. Parkinson's disease drugs replace dopamine, create odd side effects... sugar diets, sensuality, etc. Neuromarketing: free, food, and f***. The promise of desire unlocks inhibition. Dopamine causes desire... and anxiety. Absence of dopamine is not peace, its depression.Ch6: discounted rewards, bounded rationality. Prefrontal cortex vs dopamine. We are rational, until we are not. Having immediate gratification in hand/in sight is a willpower torpedo. Marshmallow test. Prearrange commitments and punishments. Predict your distractions and plan your reactions. Cortez burning his boats at the Yucatan.Ch7: We treat our future self as if he were a stranger. Future self continuity. Those who feel connected with their future selves are more likely to save. Visualize the future, look at 3D avatars of self. Hyperopia, some people cant enjoy the present at all. They must transpose all the advice in this book.Ch8: Infection. Mirror neurons. How you act is how i will act. How you feel is how i will feel. Air force obesity. Casual smoking. Good behaviors are infectious as well. We all regress to the center. Social cues are WAY more powerful than rational arguments. Shame and pride: photos of thieves. Pride is more powerful because shame triggers thoughts of pleasure. Pride upholds heart rate variablility. Visualize. Use social networks. Friends and family are WAY more influential than strangers. Influence is general to short-term long-term reward, and not the specific reward itselfCh9: Forbidden thoughts. The ironic rebound. White bears. Operator/monitor model. Just give up. SAD sufferers. Just accept the emotion. Dieters. Surf the wave, mindfulness. Smokers torture chamber. You cant control your thoughts. You can control your actions.Ch10: Stress and guilt DON'T WORK. Awareness does."

Scientific studies to back up claims2. Summaries so that you don't miss the larger context3. Exercises and challenges so you can test yourself what works and what doesn't4. Advice about how to practice the techniques you learnI really recommend this book to everyone and I'll definitely use several of the tools for behavior regulation both on me and while coaching others."
58,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6032685-shelley,4,"If you struggle to change bad habits or unhealthy behavior, this book will probably be useful. The author has a straightforward approach and matter of fact language. There are lots of helpful ways to change the way you think so you can change the way you act. I already knew a certain amount about this subject but I learned a lot myself....."
59,1583334386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57576518-nidhi,4,"A self-help book without the usual self-help gobbledygook. The Willpower Instinct is grounded in science. McGonigal constantly refers to studies, research, and psychological terms. The language, however, does not seem pedantic. I believe the advice in this book actually works. "
