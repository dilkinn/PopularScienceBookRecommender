0,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1184446-michael,1,"I have to share my discontent with the world after keeping the words bottled up inside me for so long.I bought this book about two or three years ago, thinking it might be an entertaining read that might fill me in on some of the historical aspects of the English language. I had already read ""A Short History Of Nearly Everything"", and, knowing nothing about science, thought it was a rather entertaining read, even though I had some... well, doubts about the book since I tend to favour more systematic and precise literature over a tapestry of facts with entertainment and jokes woven in. I also believe this to be one of the few books I have on my Goodreads shelves worthy of one star only.Why? Before I start, let me tell you two things: it has been a long time since I read the book, so my memory may not be as fresh anymore. The second thing I would like to mention is that I have some kind of idea about linguistics, but am not a linguist; where I am, however, a kind of expert, is in the study of foreign languages. I am therefore intimately acquainted with the workings of many foreign languages -- though almost all of them are European. I have also rather extensively studied the historical connections between languages and their classification in language families and so on.It is painfully obvious that Bryson speaks no foreign languages. Fine. Neither does Chomsky and he knows a thing or two about linguistics. You don't have to be a multilingual prodigy to study linguistics, after all. But I digress.Bryson makes the same mistake most monolingual speakers of any language make: they think of their language as something unique. Bryson tries to justify the popularity of the English language not with historical or political arguments (because I am sure that the colonization of a significant part of the world by the British Empire and the subsequent cultural and political hegemony of the United States had nothing to do with it -- nooo, English is magic!), but rather seems to believe that English has, through some kind of divine intervention, been miraculously endowed with characteristics that have made it ""beat the other languages""... as if linguistics were some kind of free-market economy where the best product gets the biggest share of the market.Bryson then tries to argue the point with facts that are, while true for the most part, totally irrelevant. Seriously, this is like reading a paper by a student who's been watching one too many linguistic quiz shows on ITV, if such a thing existed; someone who likes to read trivia sections, and then pieces together the information obtained therefrom and tries to pass it off as knowledge to people unfortunate enough to be more ignorant than him. One ""fact"" that makes the English language so great, he says, is that it has ""so many more words than all the other languages"". How many words a language has, Bill, is not only something that cannot accurately be ascertained, but also something that is completely irrelevant. Why? In brief, language create composita in a different way, for instance; so where you might create a million different random words in German, in other languages, you have to link them together, meaning you will have less dictionary hits. Not that that has any bearing on the ""quality"" of the language. Some languages even HAVE to make more words because they have agglutinative qualities (such as Hungarian and Turkish; meaning they lump prefixes, suffixes, and other elements together, creating big lump words). Also, English is the dominant language of science; as such, a lot of the scientific vocabulary is included in dictionaries. Not that these words are usually English (except for the newer sciences like computer science, of course); they often come from Latin or Ancient Greek anyway. There are also more dictionaries being produced in English on account of it being more ""popular"", and the commercial production of English being more viable. As such, its lexicography can be assumed to be more advanced. ""Word count"" is as irrelevant as the number of brain cells or the size of the brain with regards to intelligence.This is my biggest beef with Bill's book. At one point, I had to stop reading. I should read it again and reiterate some of the other numerous ""arguments"" Bill Bryson puts forward in favour of the English language. I can only advise the author to commit himself to the study of foreign languages for a while, and to understand that ""fun facts"", no matter how objectively true they are, don't always have the meaning or significance someone thinks they have if one is not familiar with the field being discussed. Unfortunately, Bryson probably thought that he can easily trespass on this territory, since everyone who is able to speak must be a linguist. My review may sound harsh, but this book definitely does more harm than good. And people should remember that ""fun fact"" books, be they about natural sciences or linguistics, do not represent knowledge. I am sure that people endowed with a deeper understanding of natural science have shaken their head at ""A Short History Of Nearly Everything"" as well."
1,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732970-ceci,2,"The one thing that bothered me the most about this book was a huge error it had on swearwords, in reference to my mother tongue Finnish: (p. 210, Ch. Swearing, in my Penguin paperback:) “Some cultures don’t swear at all. (…) The Finns, lacking the sort of words you need to describe your feelings when you stub your toe getting up to answer a phone at 2.00 a.m., rather oddly adopted the word “ravintolassa.” It means ‘in the restaurant.’""I mean, what the hell?! We Finns have probably the world's most colourful collection of swearwords. Someone pulled old Bill's leg, and did it properly too. That casts doubt on all he has written, really. And nobody says ""ravintolassa"" unless they do in fact mean ""in the restaurant."""
2,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,2,"The Mother Tongue is the story of the evolution of the English language, from its humble beginnings as a Germanic tongue to what it has evolved into over the centuries.So, Bill Bryson + cheap equals insta-buy for me, apparently. Too bad even Bill Bryson couldn't make this terribly entertaining.I have a long history as ""the obscure facts guy"" at social gatherings, at least, I did when people still invited me to such things. However, even I had trouble sticking with this one at times.Old Bill is in fine form, cracking wise and still being informative at every opportunity. He didn't get much in the way of interesting material to work with in this case.The book was not without its moments, however. I did enjoy the chapter on swearing, as well as numerous tidbits, or titbits, as they were called in a less prudish era, that peppered the other chapters. Too bad the gems were scarce and some of the reading resembled the back-breaking labor involved in mining.While I found the book informative and mildly amusing, at the end of the day, it's still a book about the history of words. Even one of the funnier travel writers alive can't make chicken salad from chicken feathers in this case. 2.5 out of 5."
3,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44478099-abby,4,"I gave this book 4 stars for an enjoyable reading experience. But, if I'm being honest, I'm not entirely sure how accurate it is. The idea of this being credible nonfiction came to a bit of screeching halt for me when Bryson described Pennsylvania Dutch as an English dialect. He seems to have confused the broken English many (older) Amish and Mennonite speak (expressions like ""make open the door"") with the separate language of Pennsylvania Dutch, which is a variant of German.It was a fun book. And as someone who has never been able to spell, I finally feel the vindication! But I wouldn't stake much on this book's accuracy."
4,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4460898-cassidy,1,"I know exactly a little bit about English, and a little bit less about linguistics in general. Studied a few foreign languages, took a linguistics class or two in college. I'm what you might call a big fan of language. A dabbler. Certainly not an expert. But boy, did I find this book infuriating.My problem with this book is that it gets so much right, and so much wrong. The example that really set me off was his treatment of the Welsh language. To Bryson, Welsh is ""as unpronounceable as it looks"", and Welsh pronunciations ""rarely bear much relation to their spellings."" He then spouts off with a series of jokes that are so ethnocentric and condescending that, if you took them at face value, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor backward speakers of silly old Welsh.The problem is, he's completely wrong. I happened to study the phonology and orthography of Welsh for about a week in that freshman linguistics class (I know, that makes me a big authority, right?) but in that week I learned something Bryson apparently never bothered to look up: Welsh orthography is remarkably regular, about as regular as Spanish. It's not at all difficult if you bother to learn the rules, which are far simpler than those of English. (The fact that I learned them in one week, and remember them decades later, should be some indication of how easy they are.) The phoneme represented by the double-l is called a lateral fricative, and yes, it's hard to pronounce if you don't speak Welsh, but that does not mean it's sometimes pronounced ""kl"" and other times ""thl"" as Bryson suggests. It is always pronounced just like it's spelled. But Bryson's Anglo-American tin ear failed to pick that up, and he took his ignorance and turned it into a cheap joke at another culture's expense.Knowing that he got Welsh so wrong made me doubt all of the rest of the information in the book. And that's a real shame, because it covers such fascinating topics, and it's so very entertainingly written. But it's hard to enjoy Bryson's jokes when you have this nagging suspicion that he's bending the truth for the sake of a snappy punchline."
5,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"Ever since I learned to read, English has been my favourite language - I took to it like a duck takes to water (at least, I guess they take to it willingly, and that baby ducks are not paddled until their feathers fly by Mamma Duck to make them). This was the cause of the eternal chagrin of my mother who, being a staunch nationalist, wanted me to prefer Hindi over English. She recited to me a famous couplet in Malayalam, which said:""Other languages are merely nannies;For man, the native tongue is the mother.""I replied that in that case, Malayalam is my mother, and both Hindi and English are nannies. And I just happened to prefer my English nanny over my native one. She had no answer to that!Well, I am glad I stuck to English over Hindi, because this is one crazy nanny - totally idiosyncratic and eccentric, just like me. And to tell you how eccentric, who better than Bill Bryson?If you approach this book hoping for a scholarly analysis of the English language, you are going to be sorely disappointed. For that don't come to old Bill. What he does is to throw out titbits (or tidbits in the US, as they the consider the former spelling risque - so Bryson tells me) of information, some useful, some useless, some bizarre: but all fascinating. One thing you can be sure of - you won't be disappointed.This book is a linguistic, historical and geographical romp through English wherein Bill tackles such varied subjects as1. The origin and spread of English2. The evolution of words3. Pronunciation4. Spelling5. The varieties of English, both inside the UK and outside6. Dictionaries and their producers7. Where names come from8. Profanity9. Wordplay... and much more.There is not a single boring sentence. You are guaranteed to be snickering throughout."
6,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,4,"Non-fiction. Published in 1990, this book is already a little out of date. In its first pages, Bryson reports OED editor Robert Burchfield's theory that American English and British English are drifting apart so rapidly that within two hundred years we won't be able to understand each other. That was a theory made back when cell phones still required a battery the size of an unabridged dictionary, long before the internet became such a large part of the way the world communicates, in a time when you couldn't imagine downloading a British Doctor Who or an American Stargate Atlantis to your iPod. We live in a new world! Unfortunately it's also a world where the Harry Potter books are ""translated"" for American readers, lest we be too confused by the lingo: ""What's this? Harry's eating a biscuit? And wearing a jumper? While battling Fizzolian Snargletoothed Whatsits?! This book is impenetrable!"" JK Rowling aside, with communication technology becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, I think we'll still be able to communicate two hundred years down the line. Bryson eventually disagrees with Burchfield for many of the same reasons, though he was unable to cite the internet as a factor.In that way, this book is showing its age -- the chapter on online language use is, of course, conspicuously absent -- but it's got the history part down. Bryson spends most of his time looking at how we got where we are today. Where English came from, how it got to England, where it went from there. With its in-text references, footnotes, extensive bibliography and index, this book looks almost academic, but Bryson, an American living in England, handles it all with a cheerfully low-key sense of humor -- almost as if Terry Pratchett had turned his eye to grammar -- and even a refreshingly open approach to the word fuck in the chapter on swearing.My one complaint is that, despite being loosely hung on British and American history, for the most part the book lacks a greater structure and ends up reading like a series of interesting facts. But, hell, they got my attention, and, as it happened, the attention of everyone around me: ""Hey! Did you know the Romans had no word for grey?"" Since English, as this book proves, is a big crazy mess, I guess Bryson can be excused for not being able to wrangle its history into a more pleasing order. Lack of structure aside, I really enjoyed reading this and will be reading more books by Bryson in the future."
7,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,1,"1★ (DNF)I thought this would be fun. I love words and languages and have a passing interest in linguistics. I started this with enthusiasm and was enjoying his breezy style until it occurred to me that a lot of what he was saying seemed to be anecdotal. You know, limited or no research. Then I thought, well, it was written more than 25 years ago, so things that sounded like old stories to me may have been new stories then – like this one:
“The Eskimos, as is well known, have fifty words for types of snow—though curiously no word for just plain snow. To them there is crunchy snow, soft snow, fresh snow, and old snow, but no word that just means snow.” 
There’s a wealth of articles about this half-truth (I’m being generous). Here’s one http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca...So how many grains of salt would I need to swallow the declaration that immediately followed? An unhealthy amount, I’m sure.
“The Italians, as we might expect, have over 500 names for different types of macaroni.”
He goes on to say these include 
“spaghetti
 and 
vermicelli.”
 He obviously means types of pasta.Then he got into some languages I have a smattering of myself – French and German—and I began questioning. Some of it just sounded wrong, like the quote from an article that says most speakers of other languages aren’t aware there is such a thing as a thesaurus.At this point, I decided I’d read some reviews to see if anyone who knows more than I do felt the same way. Sadly, there are a lot. You can check the low-rating reviews on Amazon that actually discuss the many factual errors. I stopped reading, thinking I might accidentally absorb some of the ""facts"" and perpetuate them myself!How disappointing. One star for the writing."
8,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/882708-julie-jjmachshev,5,"What a hilarious, fascinating, and educational look at our wacky, wonderful, and WAY complicated language. If English is your mother tongue, this book will amaze and amuse you with interesting tidbits about just how our language evolved into the wonder it is. If you had to learn English as a second language (and more power to you), then bless your heart for taking on the task. You will read this book, and say YES, absolutely, I always wondered..., etc. Bill Bryson turns his sharp-eyes to ""The Mother Tongue"" and takes us all on a fabulous journey through and overview of the intricacies of human language. You will laugh, smile, and learn a few things while you're at it!!!"
9,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8531296-rebecca,1,"I teach English as a foreign language but other than that linguistics and language learning is just a hobby, having said that, I know enough Irish, German, Czech, Russian and Spanish to know that the things he said about these languages are half truths or complete and utter codswallop. For example claiming that the German preposition/suffix ""auf"" is unusual among foreign words in that it has more than one meaning... anyone who has spent any time learning a language will tell you that all of them have words with dozens of meanings (Except maybe Esperanto?). Furthermore there is no preposition in any language that cannot be translated into at least three or four prepositions in English, nor are there any English prepositions that don't have numerous translations in the other language. That's just how prepositions are! They don't translate!The first chapter of this book has so many mistakes that I couldn't finish it. Almost every sentence has a mistake.It is a collage of newspaper clippings. If you read the credits at the back you'll see that he only consulted newspapers and magazines and did no real research. I can't go through all the mistakes, I really don't have the time, there are just too many. If it continues in this way then this is a work of complete and utter fiction.I loved ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" and now I am frightened that if I knew anything whatsoever about ""Everything"" I would have found that that book too was filled with amusing but completely made up factoids. "
10,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,3,"I'm a longtime fan of Bill Bryson, but I had never read this early nonfiction work of his and was delighted to see that my library had a copy of the audiobook. ""The Mother Tongue"" has the expected rambling charm of a Bryson nonfiction work. When he becomes enamored on a topic (such as the history of our houses in ""At Home"" or the history of our universe in ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"") Bryson digs up all kinds of interesting facts and stories and anecdotes and puts it all together in a delightfully interesting collection of essays. In this book, he discusses the history of the English language, but also the history of languages in general, the history of dictionaries, and many of the odd pronunciations and spellings that are so peculiar to English. Knowing that ""The Mother Tongue"" was published in 1990, I had fun imagining what additions Bryson would have added to the text today, knowing how many new words have been adopted since the Internet took over our world. Overall, this was a pleasant read and is a nice complement to other books that have been written about the English language. Recommended.Opening Passage""More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say that the results are sometimes mixed. Consider this hearty announcement in a Yugoslavian hotel: 'The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the job of the chambermaid. Turn to her straightaway.' Or this warning to motorists in Tokyo: 'When a passenger of the foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage, then tootle him with vigor.' Or these instructions gracing a packet of convenience food from Italy: 'Besmear a backing pan, previously buttered with a good tomato sauce, and, after dispose the cannelloni, lightly distanced between them in a only couch.' Clearly the writer of that message was not about to let a little ignorance of English stand in the way of a good meal. In fact, it would appear that one of the beauties of the English language is that even with the most tenuous grasp you can speak volumes if you show enough enthusiasm — a willingness to tootle with vigor, as it were."""
11,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,4,"I always enjoy a Bill Bryson book. I love his sense of humour and the way he can turn the driest subject into something entertaining. Of course that does mean you cannot believe a word of it since he is always looking for the most shocking or the most amusing way to present each topic. Why ruin a good joke with the truth?So if you are looking for an erudite and trustworthy account of the development of the English language I am sure there are many very worthy tomes out there! This is just for fun and it is absolutely that, lots and lots of fun.Having said that there are lots of interesting bits which really make you think about what you say and write every day, things that you may have never actually noticed. Lots and lots of 'aha' moments:) I enjoyed it very much."
12,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/682662-ceridwen,1,"Sorry Mr Bryson, but as a historical linguist of English myself, I cannot take this book seriously. There are simply too many mistakes that have no place in a well-researched book. The subject matter is not that hard, so I can only guess ""The Mother Tongue"" was written in such a hurry that you only consulted one or two sources, where it should have been five or six. The history of English is not something you learn from reading one textbook; there is a lot of ongoing research and debate. And most of your sources are a decade or two out of date, even for 1991. Get your facts straight and publish a revised edition is the best advice I can give you.And as for my fellow readers: buy David Crystal's The Stories of English instead. Far better researched and just as entertaining."
13,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3974931-aleksi,2,"Bryson's book on the English language is a compendium of linguistic trivia interspersed with the author's biased and misinformed musings on the history and features of the language. Published in 1990, the book was written before Internet changed the way the world communicates and hence a lot of the content regarding the spread of languages is hopelessly outdated by now.Bryson is not a linguist, neither is he a historian. Therefore his attempts to explain the popularity and status of English as the lingua franca of the modern world come off haphazard at best. Bryson's love for his native English is clear enough; so is his painfully obvious lack of knowledge of any other languages. I did not care to keep count of the times he falsely asserts some feature in English cannot be found in any other language or blatantly moves the goalposts to prove how infinitely richer English is compared to anything.For all the little anecdotes and copious bits of trivia it contains, I really want to like the book more than I do. Unfortunately once it becomes clear that many of these factoids won't stand up to closer scrutiny -- Bryson doesn't even blink as he repeats the age-old and very disputed claim that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow -- it becomes hard to believe anything the book claims.The most baffling and outrageous claim of all is the one that strikes closest to home. Bryson has the audacity to suggest we Finns have no native swear words and use the phrase ""in the restaurant"" as a curse instead. Perkele, I say."
14,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"You know, there are probably better books on the history of the English language, there are probably deeper books on the nature of linguistics, there are probably a million reasons why you might not read this book - but it tackles something that we all ought to be interested in, our mother tongue, with style, flare and humour. Bryson says in this that he had his mum sending him newspaper cuttings - that is such a lovely image. I read this years ago, tried to read it to the kids at night, but they were just that bit young, and then listened to the talking book recently. If you haven't had the pleasure of this book yet, you should think about it. "
15,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,1,"I know and I do even realise that Bill Bryson is considered an entertaining author and that he also seems to be much loved and appreciated by many. However, I for one have found his general tone of narrational voice and the boastful, arrogant demeanour he constantly seems to present and yes indeed often downright spew in The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way extremely off-putting and really at best massively condescending, with his claims regarding the supposed superiority of the English language both unacademic and yes, profoundly bigoted and stereotyping (and as such of course absolutely devoid of any kind of linguistic acumen and actual bona fide language based knowledge). And albeit granted that English is at present a so-called and even aptly labelled world language, the reasons why English is such, the reasons why English is so profoundly popular and globally strong at present are NOT (in my opinion) due to any type of linguistic superiority, they are primarily and simply cultural and historic in nature and also have much to do with economics and not with English being in any manner a better and superior language linguistically speaking than French, German, Chinese, Russian and so on and so on. Quite frankly, Mr. Bryson (and if you are offended by this, sorry, but I care not), your attitudes about English and the fact that you somehow think and assume the language is better, is supposedly more advanced and of higher quality than other languages, this attitude truly makes me as a person of German background cringe profoundly, as it strongly and uncomfortably reminds me of the type of rhetoric that was used in the Third Reich by Adolf Hitler and his ilk to claim and attempt to demonstrate that German (that the Germanic languages) were supposedly both linguistically and genetically superior and more advanced than other language groups and families. However, languages are simply languages and in my opinion (and actually in the opinion of many if not most academically trained linguists worth considering) NO language is in any manner and in any way superior and those who attempt to claim this (especially if they are categorical and unilateral in and with their philosophies) are at best profoundly naive and at worst downright and frighteningly dangerous. One star (and really, with The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way, I actually almost wish I could give less than one star, and I have since reading or should I say since attempting to peruse this book actively shied away from trying any more offerings from Bill Bryson's pen, his seeming general popularity notwithstanding, especially and in particular since many of the ""facts"" the author has cited to cement his claims that English as a language is supposedly somehow superior to and of better and more lasting quality than other world languages are academically wrong anyhow, are not the truth or only partially the truth, and for a non-fiction linguistic tome, this just is not in any way even remotely acceptable)."

17,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,4,"I found Bill Bryson about a month ago when I read hilarious In a Sunburned Country. I liked that one a lot and decided to try out his other book. And I liked this one too, but unfortunately not as much as In a Sunburned Country. And there are several reasons for that. Including the one that it can be at least partly my fault.And that's what I will start with. I am not an English native speaker. I have never lived in any English-speaking country. I have been learning English at school. I manage pretty well, I can read books in English without too much difficulty. Which does not change the fact that there are a lot of words that I do not know (and I'm fully aware of that). I am also not particularly sensitive to differences in pronunciation between British and American English. I mean, I'm aware of these differences (I am usually able to recognize an American and a British when I hear them), but I do not think I can pronounce the word first according to one and then according to the other pronunciation. I read this book in English and I must admit that although it is very interesting, as a non-English speaker, I was not able to fully appreciate it and understand it.On the other hand, as a foreigner who had to learn English (and I’m native in non-Roman language), Bryson's insight in this area was particularly interesting and accurate for me. Especially when it comes to intricate English pronunciation. So a big plus for that.Another issue, Bryson wrote his book in the late 1980s. The world has changed a lot since then. First of all, we have internet, which, at least in my opinion, makes British and American English even closer to each other and more similar. That is why the book seemed to be slightly outdated at times. I would love to read its modernized version.The above list of imperfections does not mean that I did not like the book. Just like always, it's easier for me to specify what I was not delighted with than what I like. And I must admit that this is a very good book. However, I think that it is directed primarily to English native speakers, because they will be able to capture and better understand all the issues that the author raises.Anyway, this is definitely not my last book by Bill Bryson. I can not wait to read another of his books. This time may be travel related."
18,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma,4,"Surprisingly, I didn’t find this as engaging as his other books."
19,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,2,"I picked this up thinking that Bryson had, in my experience, always been entertaining, witty and informative and that this was a topic of much interest to me, so how could I go wrong?Well, a sample of two is not enough to go on, apparently because this turned out disappointing, for two primary reasons:1. It was first published in 1990 and it has not aged well. Some statistics are well out of date, Bryson using a figure of 56 million for the population of Britain, with 60 million more accurate at the time I write, for example. The political position has moved on, too.2. Errors and inconsistencies. Some statements are just plain wrong. At one point Bryson says that the Irish Prime Minister's title sounds like ""tea-sack"" when rendered into phonetic English spelling. This is just incoorect; it is more like ""tea-shock"" even ""tea-shop"" if one was not listening attentively. Bryson says that the six Celtic languages arose from one predecessor called Celtic. Every other source I've read uses the term Brythonic for this extinct predecessor. It's possible that philologists have changed their terminology and don't use the term ""Brythonic"" any more (just as they don't call themselves philologists anymore) but even if that is so, later Bryson suggests that Welsh is a Gaelic language, which no authority is going to agree with.As far as inconsistencies go, two stick with me: First Bryson tacitly identifies himself with Britain in the early part of the book, then later on as American...perhaps not surprising considering his Pond hoping tendencies. The second is worse; in the chapter on American accents and dialects he starts by agreeing that the USA shows less regional variation than britain and ends suggesting that there is, in fact, one dialect per person....The effect of these two problems is to, one way or another, call into question the validity of just about everything expressed as a statement of fact, unless one already knows of an independent authority who agrees. This is most unfortunate, as the topic is fascinating and the writing is witty, though sometimes angry; English is also emotive!"
20,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030455-peter-macinnis,5,"I'm a writer, and I don't hold with slam-dunking other writers in print, because they can't reply. In a more open medium like this, I am prepared to serve Bryson as he serves others, but with a little less barren pedantry.It's an excellent book, but like so many foreigners, Bryson thinks a quick tour makes him an expert on all things Australian. WRONG!!We don't say cookie, we say biscuit. Getting that wrong is clumsy.We don't normally say ""labor"", we call it labour. The sole exception is in the name of the Australian Labor Party, which adopted that spelling in the 19th century.Bomboras are in the sea, not in rivers, a didgeridoo is not a form of trumpet, and outback is not an Aboriginal word (though bombora is), and we don't normally say ""technicolour yawn"": it was a joke put forward by Barry Humphries, not common usage.I could go on and demolish his assertions about the Australian accents (he seems to think that any one of us speaks one, only) and if somebody is going to be arch about other people's proofing, page 139, the first page of chapter 10 needs to be looked at HARD.I like the book, I just didn't appreciate the superior tone of somebody who is, like the rest of us, inclined to slip from time to time."
21,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Mother Tongue: The English Language, by Bill Bryson, London: Penguin Books, 1990 (link is to a different, in-print edition).Summary: This amusing and informative book surveys the history of the English language and all its vagaries and perplexities of word origins, spellings, and pronunciations and why it has become so successful as a world language.Has it every occurred to you how many different meanings there are for the word fly? It can be an insect, a means of travel, a verb form of ""to flee"", something a fisherman ties, one of the results of a batter hitting a baseball, or something no man wants open in public. As in so many of Bryson's books, he had me at the opening page as he explored some of the perplexities of our language that native speakers negotiate almost without thought. He had me in the first chapter as he proposed that part of the success of the language is the incredible richness of vocabulary (at the time of publication, the OED had 615,000 words), flexibility of usage, and relative simplicity, particularly in comparison to tonal languages of rendering the language in print.He surveys the history of language, the world's language families and where English is situated in the Indo-European stream, and all the other offshoots, some which are no longer living languages. He recounts the triumph of Anglo-Saxon language over Celtic (even though many of England's place names preserve their Celtic roots), the impact of the Norman invasion (of 10,000 words, approximately 3/4ths are still in use including much of the language of nobility (duke, baron prince) and much language of jurisprudence (justice, jury, prison among others). He explores the different ways words are created, sometimes by doing nothing! His discussion of pronunciation and particularly the shifts in vowel sounds was fascinating, For example house was once pronounced hoose. You weren't born in a barn but barn in a born.Then there is the matter of spelling and the role of printing and dictionaries in bring a greater if not complete uniformity to spelling--is it ax or axe, judgment or judgement (it is fascinating that the spell check in this word processor highlighted the latter of these two, and yet both are accepted with the shortened forms preferred). Of course so much of this discussion is the concern of some to promote the good and proper use of the language, and yet what is fascinating is the shifting ideas through history of what this is, according to Bryson. Similarly, we have the divergences between New World and Old and some wonder whether American English will become a distinct language.Bryson's concluding chapters explore the origins of proper names, our propensity for wordplay, and the history of what are now considered vulgarities (although I think since Bryson wrote, what was censored in from public media in my youth is becoming more and more common). What is fascinating is that many of these were once in common parlance in Chaucer and Shakespeare. Equally fascinating are our various forms of wordplay, the ultimate of which must be the palindrome where a sentence says the same thing forwards and backwards (an example from the book: ""A man, a plan, a canal, Panama."")Anyone who writes can understand the challenges of finding the right rather than the almost right word, and how easy it is to think you are saying one thing only to be understood by others as saying the opposite. I found Bryson's book a delightful diversion that better helped me understand both the joy of using this language and the frustrations of rendering the conceptions of mind into words that communicate."
22,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,4,"English is one crazy language. As a person who is not a native speaker, this book is very insightful in terms of how the most globalized language developed (and is still developing). It is similar with how history's made, there were wars, migrations, proliferation of mass media, the making of dictionaries, public figures making their own linguistic marks (and complete fools of themselves), class and regional divisions, and so on and so forth. Bryson is a funny guy. I think I have read at least two of his works previously and he never disappoints in making me chuckled or even roaring with laughter. True, there was a stultifying effect of him becoming too enthusiastic with his many, many examples, when he already made his points. That's my biggest gripe from reading this novel.Nevertheless, the book itself is a bundle of joy of finding invariably humorous take on how word changed - even corrupted - over the course of time. It is amusing to know people made mistakes and those mistakes held on until today. It made me wonder, though, since English is very much a dynamic language co-created together by the whole world depending on the generation, how much it will change in the next 100 years? We know that the Oxford Dictionary added ""twerk"", ""derp"" and ""selfie"" back in 2013 (which caused quite a bit of uproar), and in June 2017 alone, there are at least 100 new words. With the growing invasion of foreign and urbandictionary.com words, would English become the One True Lingua Franca? As for Indonesia, English speakers should feel more at home here (at least in the urban areas) in the next decade or more, with all these centennials at the malls talking fluent English for their daily conversation. English book fairs are always loaded with people (and bloody, thieving online shops). I just hope the rest of the country can keep up with developing their skill. But I also hope that these fluent young speakers do not forget their own language."
23,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/400871-anne,1,"Why was this book even published? There are so many errors, inaccuracies, misconceptions, misunderstandings and whatnot, I don't even know where to begin. (And I'm not even a linguist.)All of this makes me question all the other ""facts"" I don't know anything about, I simply don't know if I've learned more about them from reading this book.The Acknowledgements of the book mentions several people, but I hope for their sake that he didn't follow their advice. Otherwise they should receive a dishonorable mention and be out of work.I give it one star because Bill Bryson writes well. Review part I: Bringing science to the people, Bill Bryson style, is always funny and edcuational. However, this book is old, (it was written before the Wall came down, which is evident in the mentioning of the number of citizens of the Soviet Union who don't speak Russian) and a lot has happened in the lingustic field since then. So I'm not sure the information is always correct. Until I find out, I will simply enjoy the book as is :-)One curious thing: Norwegians supposedly ""talk about departing like an Englishman"" (p7) Eh, really? Never heard of that. Googling it, I find only quotes from this book.Update: Not sure I'll finish this book. I was worried it'd be outdated, but that's only part of the problem. There are so many inaccuracies, facts that are not facts at all and some Bryson attitude issues.I've mentioned the Norwegian example above and other Goodreads reviews mentions that, according to this book, mordern Finnish has no swear words (!) and Bryson's understanding of (to him) foreign languages like Japanese and German leads to wrong or not quite accurate conclusions. Also quotes like ""As of 1989, the Basque separatist organization ETA ... had committed 672 murders in the name of linguistic and cultural independence"" (p35) is rather particular, to say the least. His rant about funny Welsh spelling and pronounciation is silly. (p36) In some languages, like Spanish, spelling and pronounciation are almost the same, in other languages, like Danish and apparantly Welsh, they are not. Also, the pronounciation of a specific language is difficult or easy according to your own mother tongue. German to me is easy, Japanese is difficult. A book like this should acknowledge these things."
24,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47172380-darcy-leech,5,"As a language lover, The Mother Tongue is fun and informative. I read this for my college rhetoric class, and fell in love with the enjoyable read with knowledge worthy of an upper level college English class. Bryson's true gift is in making the nature of linguistics both understandable and relevant. The author has fun playing with words - I laughed out loud multiple times. The best chapter is the one on what is considered obscene language, not because it feels good to curse, but because it increases your cultural awareness and empathy to think about how a conquering nation determines what words are proper and what words are vile. It might make you think twice before you correct the way someone speaks with a regional dialect. Bryson isn't about prescriptive grammar and language elitism, but about exploring the nature of human communication. Should we really isolate someone because they speak differently than we do? Language is a natural and essential aspect of the human condition and the more you know about language evolution and acquisition, the more you should appreciate the diversity of successful communications."
25,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6017691-stephanie,2,"Is the fact that my grandfather gave me this book reason enough to keep reading? Some of the stories are interesting, and even reasonably factual, but at other times the failed fact-checking is glaringly obvious--and come on, the perpetuation of the ""Eskimo Snow Myth""?I think the lesson here is that as a linguist, I should not be reading popular writings about language. It's true that there are a thousand interesting things to encounter in the history of the English language, replete as it is with situations of language contact. I think what bothers me most is the very thinly veiled ""linguo""centrism that turns it from a piece of enthusiastic writing about the English language into a poorly-argued case for why English is better than every other language on the planet. As a native English speaker who spends every day contemplating and studying other languages, I can't disagree strongly enough with a message like that."
26,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,0,"Mother Tongue: Essays on the Origins and Usage of EnglishMy wife was lent this book by a British friend of ours, but I decided to read it as I've heard about Bill Bryson's popular travel books like Notes from a Small Island and book A Brief History of Everything, about his travels through England before moving back to the US after a long time in his adopted home. He's an interesting guy who grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, became a popular travel writer, and was even Chancellor of prestigious Durham University in the UK. So he's very much a bicultural American-Brit who can see different aspects of both societies from the inside and outside, and also has a wide-ranging intellect and deft sense of humor.Mother Tongue is a series of essays on the origins of human language, with plenty of interesting scientific insights, then to the messy origins of English amid the various waves of invasions of the original Celtic peoples of Britain by Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Normans, Scandinavians (Vikings), and so forth, to its growing status as a global language. I enjoyed this part of the book the most, learning a lot about the origins of the language that was especially useful now that I live in England myself. I also didn't know that Latin evolved into French, Spanish, and Italian among other languages, to my embarrassment. Given the many travels we've had through Europe in the past two years, a lot of the early origins of the Celtic peoples in Europe and the migrations of various peoples across the continent and to the British isles during the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages is really fascinating stuff.The middle portion of the book gets very involved in examining the evolution of English spellings and pronunciations as it moved from Old English to Modern English, and the further hiving off of American English from British English. Some of this was really illuminating, but the parts discussing the minute details of spelling and grammatical shifts were slow-going unless you are truly a student of the language and I found somewhat less interesting.The chapter on swearing was quite funny, there's plenty to learn there. And throughout the book Bryson's humor makes the subject matter interesting. However, though he does make regular references to other languages, the book is by its nature extremely English-centric so many of the statements about how unique English is are almost certainly inaccurate as he is not so authoritative a linguist so much as a very well-informed enthusiast. The book's 1990 publication also betrays its age as it is hopelessly out of date when describing how absurdly impractical the computer keyboards are for Chinese and Japanese users and how that has hindered their economic development. Can't blame a book for being out of date, so it's actually somewhat amusing to see how things can change so much in just a few decades.I'm looking forward to reading A Brief History of Everything next before moving onto his well-liked travel stories."
27,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"This is a good, concise, erudite, readable over-view of the history, present and future of the English language. Bryson is a funny man and a witty writer and this book ranges from the first recorded sentence in English - ""This she-wolf is a reward to my kinsman"" - to Cockney rhyming slang, though palindromes, anagrams and the politics of spelling. Recommended to anyone with any interest in our weird, wonderful, ever-evolving mother tongue."
28,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6326169-negin,4,"When it comes to Bill Bryson, I tend to prefer his travelogues. Although “The Mother Tongue” is not a travelogue, I enjoyed it greatly. It’s a fascinating and, as is usually the case with Bryson, entertaining account of evolution of the English language. I don’t consider myself a word or language nerd at all, yet I loved all the trivia, such as those that I’ve quoted below. The only reason that I’m giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that it’s a bit dated. It was written in 1990 before the internet age. I would simply love to see an updated version. All in all, this was a fun and informative read. Having lived in Britain and the U.S., I have noticed the following for years and couldn’t agree more with Bill Bryson:“No place in the English-speaking world is more breathtakingly replete with dialects than Great Britain. In America, people as far apart as New York State and Oregon speak with largely identical voices. According to some estimates almost two thirds of the American population, living on some 8o percent of the land area, speak with the same accent—a quite remarkable degree of homogeneity.If we define dialect as a way of speaking that fixes a person geographically, then it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that in England there are as many dialects as there are hills and valleys. Just in the six counties of northern England, an area about the size of Maine, there are seventeen separate pronunciations for the word house.”I thought that this was interesting:“Webster was responsible for the American aluminum in favor of the British aluminium. His choice has the fractional advantage of brevity, but defaults in terms of consistency. Aluminium at least follows the pattern set by other chemical elements— potassium, radium, and the like.”The following had me chuckling:“… the true story of an American lady, newly arrived in London, who opened her front door to find three burly men on the steps informing her that they were her dustmen. ‘Oh,’ she blurted, ‘but I do my own dusting.’ And this:“In 1989, some 77 percent of all new college graduates had taken no foreign language courses.There is evidence to suggest that some members of Congress aren’t fully sympathetic with the necessity for a commercial nation to be multilingual. As one congressman quite seriously told Dr. David Edwards, head of the Joint National Committee on Languages, ‘If English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it’s good enough for me,’ [Quoted in the Guardian, April 30, 1988].”"
29,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129343-charity,4,"Did you know that drumstick was coined in the 19th century because polite society could not bring itself to utter the word leg? Or that Shakespeare gave us no less than 1700 new words including barefaced, frugal, dwindle, and summit?Bill Bryson, an American transplanted to England, traces the history of English on both sides of the Atlantic. He explains the evolutionary accident that altered the human larynx and enabled us to speak. He traces the origins of English's naughtiest words, and offers a paean to that extraordinarily versatile American contribution to the language: O.K. A smart, funny, irreverent overview of English. Although, I strongly feel that some parts were much more engaging than others. And, unfortunately, this book is pretty dated (pre-internet/World Wide Web), so many of the statistics are no longer accurate (in fact, that is the main reason I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5). However, the extensive research into the history of the English language makes The Mother Tongue an asset to any reference shelf.>>When Bryson was discussing the simplification of the English language, I couldn't help but think of the newspeak language in George Orwell's 1984...'no need for good and bad when you can just have good and 
ungood
.'<<>>There is a rather funny reference to the horrible orations of George Bush Sr. and Dan Quayle. I wonder what Bryson would have to say about George W. Bush's bumblings.<<>>With all the 'real English' versus 'Americanisms' talk in the book, I kept thinking about John Cleese's Letter to America, which is absolutely hilarious.<<"
30,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."
31,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Recently I read ‘Made In America’ by Bill Bryson, so I thought it would be appropriate to read ‘Mother Tongue’ as well. Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
32,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt. The Japanese have no swear words at all. The Romans had 800 swear words."

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."
34,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/580436-clouddancer,1,"I'd had great hopes for this book, yet I never got beyond the first chapter simply because of the hideously large number of factual errors popping up on each page. The one thing this book is good at is - sadly - the perpetuation of myths, false beliefs and urban legends among the general public. As a fledgeling linguist I would give it a minus 1 rating if I could."
35,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,3,"I think one of the biggest struggles that I have with Bryson's work is that his books end, and sometimes it seems they take a meander down a lane that has no business being there. The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today.

I love books on linguistics, etymology, and language, but this one felt so problematic. His humor troubled me in this book because it felt clouded by inherent racism. I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America."" Forsake them? I feel like that implies that it was voluntary.""We in the English-speaking world are actually sometimes better at looking after our borrowed words than the parents were.""He also refers to the ""n word"" as an ""insulting term"" as opposed to a racial epithet.""...the 'l' sound that Orientals find so deeply impossible."" WTF, really? Orientals?""Among the new words the Australians devised, many of them borrowed from the aborigines..."" You mean appropriated.""Those captured as slaves suffered not only the tragedy of having their lives irretrievably disrupted...""

Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
46,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
47,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases. Otherwise I loved learning where some of our more familiar idioms and phrases came from. "

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"

It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
60,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."

Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
62,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."
64,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/580436-clouddancer,1,"I'd had great hopes for this book, yet I never got beyond the first chapter simply because of the hideously large number of factual errors popping up on each page. The one thing this book is good at is - sadly - the perpetuation of myths, false beliefs and urban legends among the general public. As a fledgeling linguist I would give it a minus 1 rating if I could."
65,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,3,"I think one of the biggest struggles that I have with Bryson's work is that his books end, and sometimes it seems they take a meander down a lane that has no business being there. The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today. Presents the pros and cons of the language; discusses the aspects that have been simplified and those that have been left obscure and confusing. Loved it."

I love books on linguistics, etymology, and language, but this one felt so problematic. His humor troubled me in this book because it felt clouded by inherent racism. I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America."" Forsake them? I feel like that implies that it was voluntary.""We in the English-speaking world are actually sometimes better at looking after our borrowed words than the parents were.""He also refers to the ""n word"" as an ""insulting term"" as opposed to a racial epithet.""...the 'l' sound that Orientals find so deeply impossible."" WTF, really? Orientals?""Among the new words the Australians devised, many of them borrowed from the aborigines..."" You mean appropriated.""Those captured as slaves suffered not only the tragedy of having their lives irretrievably disrupted..."" Irretrievably disrupted is what you say when you're talking about adopting a pet, not about the literal capture and ownership of PEOPLE.""A second and rather harsher problem is deciding whether a person speaks English or simply thinks he speaks it."""

Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
76,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
77,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

I found if fascinating and hilarious at the same time. English as a language, written and spoken, comes from a variety of sources, some legitimate and others, less so. But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases.

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time.

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"

It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"

I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject.

Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology.

The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt. The Japanese have no swear words at all. The Romans had 800 swear words."

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today.

I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America.""

103,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931265-paloma,5,"Review in English | Reseña en españolI love books about the history of languages and this was not the exception. Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
106,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
107,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless.

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating.

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
119,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579636-garver,4,"Thanks to Oliver for putting this one up here. It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
120,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."
121,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Recently I read ‘Made In America’ by Bill Bryson, so I thought it would be appropriate to read ‘Mother Tongue’ as well. Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
122,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

As a fledgeling linguist I would give it a minus 1 rating if I could."

The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today.

I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America.""

Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
136,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."

You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases. Otherwise I loved learning where some of our more familiar idioms and phrases came from. "

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
149,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579636-garver,4,"Thanks to Oliver for putting this one up here. It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
150,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."
151,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Recently I read ‘Made In America’ by Bill Bryson, so I thought it would be appropriate to read ‘Mother Tongue’ as well. Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
152,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today. Presents the pros and cons of the language; discusses the aspects that have been simplified and those that have been left obscure and confusing. Loved it."

I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America.""

163,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931265-paloma,5,"Review in English | Reseña en españolI love books about the history of languages and this was not the exception. Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
166,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
167,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."
168,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668409-claus,2,"I'm normally a big fan of Bill Bryson, and like his other books, this one is amusing to read. But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

I found if fascinating and hilarious at the same time. English as a language, written and spoken, comes from a variety of sources, some legitimate and others, less so. But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases. Otherwise I loved learning where some of our more familiar idioms and phrases came from. "

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
179,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579636-garver,4,"Thanks to Oliver for putting this one up here. It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
180,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."
181,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Recently I read ‘Made In America’ by Bill Bryson, so I thought it would be appropriate to read ‘Mother Tongue’ as well. Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
182,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today.

Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
196,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
197,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

I found if fascinating and hilarious at the same time. English as a language, written and spoken, comes from a variety of sources, some legitimate and others, less so. But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases. Otherwise I loved learning where some of our more familiar idioms and phrases came from. "

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"

It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
210,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."

Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."

Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

As a fledgeling linguist I would give it a minus 1 rating if I could."
215,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,3,"I think one of the biggest struggles that I have with Bryson's work is that his books end, and sometimes it seems they take a meander down a lane that has no business being there. The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today. Presents the pros and cons of the language; discusses the aspects that have been simplified and those that have been left obscure and confusing. Loved it."

I love books on linguistics, etymology, and language, but this one felt so problematic. His humor troubled me in this book because it felt clouded by inherent racism. I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America."" Forsake them? I feel like that implies that it was voluntary.""We in the English-speaking world are actually sometimes better at looking after our borrowed words than the parents were.""He also refers to the ""n word"" as an ""insulting term"" as opposed to a racial epithet.""...the 'l' sound that Orientals find so deeply impossible."" WTF, really? Orientals?""Among the new words the Australians devised, many of them borrowed from the aborigines..."" You mean appropriated.""Those captured as slaves suffered not only the tragedy of having their lives irretrievably disrupted...""

Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
226,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
227,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases.

And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time.

I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"

It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"

I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject.

Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."

Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt.

I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."

The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "

However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today.

I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America."" Forsake them? I feel like that implies that it was voluntary.""We in the English-speaking world are actually sometimes better at looking after our borrowed words than the parents were.""He also refers to the ""n word"" as an ""insulting term"" as opposed to a racial epithet.""...the 'l' sound that Orientals find so deeply impossible."" WTF, really? Orientals?""Among the new words the Australians devised, many of them borrowed from the aborigines..."" You mean appropriated.""Those captured as slaves suffered not only the tragedy of having their lives irretrievably disrupted...""

253,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931265-paloma,5,"Review in English | Reseña en españolI love books about the history of languages and this was not the exception. Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
256,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."
257,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,3,"You know that whole thing, ""You drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway?"" You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless.

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."

But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating.

I think he's funny and informative, and I've enjoyed every other book of his I've read. But this makes an awful audiobook. The narrator has to spell so many words out that it's virtually nonsensical. And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."

265,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5667548-alicia,5,Oh goodness what an interesting read. Bill Bryson has such a way of making dense material accessible for all readers. I looked up my last name after reading this- my family were tailors. My boyfriends family were bath house bathers 😂😂😂Very great and interesting read. 
266,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400971-crystal,4,"Some chapters caught my interest more than others, but this is packed full of interesting linguistics and examples. My favorite was the section on swearing!"

268,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,4,"Subtitled, ‘English and How it Got That Way’, this is typical Bryson wit and erudition at his best. I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
269,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579636-garver,4,"Thanks to Oliver for putting this one up here. It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
270,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22115116-naomi,1,"I managed perhaps thirty pages of this and gave up. I hadn't read a Bryson book before; it's unlikely I shall ever attempt another.Many of the 'facts' in the book sounded suspicious so I started looking them up elsewhere and found a great many to be wrong. I looked at the one- and two-star reviews on Amazon and found that many other people had found this too. Some people giving favourable reviews said that they weren't put off by it—it had been an entertaining read anyway.I gave up; there's no point in learning a collection of made up 'facts', however interesting they seem.The only good thing I can say about this book is that it fired in me a greater interest in the subject, for which I turned to more accurate books by people who actually know their subject. I also learnt to be more careful of what I read, and I steer well clear of Mr Bryson's works."
271,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,3,"Recently I read ‘Made In America’ by Bill Bryson, so I thought it would be appropriate to read ‘Mother Tongue’ as well. Though there was a fair chunk of similar information in both books, ‘Mother Tongue’ is just more relevant. While ‘Made in America’ focused on the history of English in America; ’Mother Tongue’ focuses mainly on the history of English in general. Trying to cover questions like, “Why is there a ‘u’ in four and not in forty?” or “Why do we tell a lie and tell the truth?”Bill Bryson does a great job of teaching and keeps the book interesting and sometimes humorous. Though the format and the style of the books are similar, I would recommend ‘Mother Tongue’ over ‘Made in America’ simply because the information is more relevant and covers all aspects of the English language.Recommended for all English geeks, this book will give you a deeper understanding of the language as well as grammatical structures like amphibology. My wife might also be happy to hear that the book covers the topic of onomatopoeia."
272,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The book may be a bit dated now and some of the facts may not be accurate, but what a fun read. Other mammals have no contact between their airways and esophagi. They can breathe and swallow at the same time. No possibility of food going down the wrong way. With Homo sapiens, food and drink must pass over the larynx on the way to the gullet. Constant risk that some of it will be inhaled. The larynx descends in humans between the age of 3 and 5 months, the exact age when Sudden Infant Death occurs. But the descended larynx explains why we can speak and our pets cannot. That ability to speak made such a difference in our evolution. The word ""pease"" in ""pease porridge hot"" was singular. But people thought it was plural, so ""pea"" back then formed as a singular. In ""Pippa Passes,"" Robert Browning uses the word ""twat,"" which meant the same thing then as it does now, but he did not realize it. He thought it was a nun's hat instead of a nun's. . . .well you know. Although English is a Germanic language, we have borrowed fewer words from German than almost any language. No one has any idea how the word ""dog"" came to replace the word ""hound."" Gutenberg may have gotten more credit than he deserves for inventing the printing press. He learned of the process when an apprentice of Laurens Koster ran off with some of his blocks. Well meaning people added ""b"" to ""doubt"" and ""debt"" to keep it more like the Latin. Same with the ""p"" in ""receipt."" The last words of French grammarian Dominique Bonhours: ""I am about to--or I am going to--die; either expression is used."" Noah Webster produced a sanitized version of the Bible. In it, men have ""peculiar members"" instead of testicles, and women do not have wombs or anything else with which to contribute to the reproductive process. Such a fear of the human body. Where does it come from? The Oxford English Dictionary insists that Shakespeare should be spelled Shakspere. They add that the commonest spelling ""is perh. Shakespeare."" Bryson adds ""it cert. is."" The last name Bush came from wine merchants always having a bush by the front door. Goldwater was a synonym for urine. He has a great list of place names from America, including Maggie's Nipples, Wyoming. In 1970 under test conditions, Roy Dean solved the London Times crossword puzzle in 3 minutes and 45 seconds. An unbelievable feat. Alfred Butts invented the game Scrabble in 1931. He insisted on two of each letter, so q, j, and z can be a problem. He deliberately depressed the number of s's. He increased the number of i's to encourage the use of suffixes. The highest score in 1987 was 3,881 points. It included the word psycholoanalyzing for 1,539 points. A list of anagrams: Ronald Wilson Reagan = Insane Anglo Warlord Spiro Agnew = Grow a Penis two plus eleven = one plus twelve Western Union = No Wire Unsent circumstantial evidence = can ruin a selected victim funeral = real fun The Morse Code = Here come dots mother-in-law = woman Hitler Victoria, England's Queen = governs a nice quiet land William Shakespeare = We all make his praise In Chinese, to call someone a turtle is the worst possible taunt. The Japanese have no swear words at all. The Romans had 800 swear words."
273,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705858-corrielle,4,"I am an English teacher. I like grammar. It fascinates me. I like knowing big words and little words and word histories and word games. Being at a computer with access to the online version of the OED (Oxford English Dictionary) can provide me with endless hours of amusement. So, this book was a treat for me. Bill Bryson writes with an exuberance and excitement about what English (and language in general) is capable of that is infectious and uplifting. Though it is not a comprehensive history of the English tongue, it does drop in at key moment and point out some of the really interesting, weird, trivial tidbits. At the same time, he recognizes some of the strange idiosyncrasies of English that make it ridiculously difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Unlike other pieces on English I've read that are uncomfortably superior sounding, this one points out some of the places where other languages can easily express concepts that English speakers don't have precise words for. I also learned that a lot of the rules we hapless grammar teachers try to impart to our students have somewhat dubious origins. For instance, I learned that using a preposition at the end of a sentence, as I have just done a couple of sentences before, is only considered improper because a fellow who wrote an influential book on grammar in England decided HE thought it sounded common and ungraceful. I was also fascinated by all of the words that were once common in Britain that have fallen out of use there, are still in use here, and are now viewed as ""Americanisms."" In fact, the section on the ""drift"" between various English speaking countries was very neat. I knew a lot of the Brit-speak already (thank you, year in London and Age of Sail fandom...) but I really liked the argument that British English, Australian English, and American English aren't drifting apart as fast as they might because of the ease of communication and the media shared between the countries. It made a lot of sense to me.Anyway, I found this to be a useful, witty, fun collection of facts and oddities concerning English."
274,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/580436-clouddancer,1,"I'd had great hopes for this book, yet I never got beyond the first chapter simply because of the hideously large number of factual errors popping up on each page. The one thing this book is good at is - sadly - the perpetuation of myths, false beliefs and urban legends among the general public. As a fledgeling linguist I would give it a minus 1 rating if I could."
275,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,3,"I think one of the biggest struggles that I have with Bryson's work is that his books end, and sometimes it seems they take a meander down a lane that has no business being there. The magic tends to get a little lost in the hedgerows as the meander turns into the bulk of the book, and so you eventually emerge muddied, having learnt something about interesting brambles, but nonetheless slightly disgruntled that you missed what you actually came for. I think this is a really good example of it- the influence of other languages on English seems to have been largely missed, and strange developments of certain terms are well and good, but lack a certain base. If you were to pick a series about the English language, Fry's English Delight will always be the absolute pinnacle of linguistic enjoyment, and this, I'm afraid, falls sadly short. "
276,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,5,"I might be a bit biased on this one because I love books about language, language development, and language evolution. However it was chock-full (and likely had the story behind and the source of this phrase) of great details and tidbits (previously the more offensive titbits) related to everything from the source of words, to spellings, and pronunciations. Fascinating how our language has changed through the years into what we see today. Presents the pros and cons of the language; discusses the aspects that have been simplified and those that have been left obscure and confusing. Loved it."

278,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/207008-jess,1,"Bryson writes from a very specific kind of perspective, one that is not quite self-aware of his privilege as a white man out in the world. I love books on linguistics, etymology, and language, but this one felt so problematic. His humor troubled me in this book because it felt clouded by inherent racism. I recognize this book was originally published in 1991, but...""...we forget just how easily people forsake their tongues—as the Celts did in Spain and France, as the Vikings did in Normandy, and as the Italians, Poles, Africans, Russians, and countless others all did in America."" Forsake them? I feel like that implies that it was voluntary.""We in the English-speaking world are actually sometimes better at looking after our borrowed words than the parents were.""He also refers to the ""n word"" as an ""insulting term"" as opposed to a racial epithet.""...the 'l' sound that Orientals find so deeply impossible."" WTF, really? Orientals?""Among the new words the Australians devised, many of them borrowed from the aborigines..."" You mean appropriated.""Those captured as slaves suffered not only the tragedy of having their lives irretrievably disrupted..."" Irretrievably disrupted is what you say when you're talking about adopting a pet, not about the literal capture and ownership of PEOPLE.""A second and rather harsher problem is deciding whether a person speaks English or simply thinks he speaks it."""

That's exactly the book, in a nutshell. But a very entertaining one. Full of good info and interesting facts about the history of the language.For example, I learned that Shakespeare is responsible for appx. 2,000 of the words we use in English, to this day. Really. He just made up a bunch of words (2,000), pulled them out of his arse, and because he was such a cool, popular guy, they stuck."

283,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931265-paloma,5,"Review in English | Reseña en españolI love books about the history of languages and this was not the exception. Bryson does a really good job in taking us through the origin of the English language, its many influences and changes, and its growth. Overall, I think this is a very entertaining account of English, with lots of interesting details and how it has become one of the most important languages worldwide. Because, whether we like it or not, English is a universal language because with all its complexities, it is relatively easy to learn and has evolved in such a way that has dropped a lot of the grammatical rules that make other languages very complex -German or Japanese, to name a few. I liked this book because I love English, and as a non-native speaker, I’ve learned to really appreciate the virtues of this language and its kindness for those of us who do not have it as a mother tongue. I will always be surprised on how easy it is to write something quite poetic in English and not sound ‘cheesy’, because in Spanish it is so hard to achieve this. While Bryson book is a bit outdated -this was written in the early 90s- his research is outstanding and he manages to provide a lot of information in a very accesible manner, enabling us to learn from very interesting, funny facts -for example, the origin of the ‘British accent’ which was made up by upper classes to differentiate themselves from the lower classes around the 18th century. I enjoyed this book throughly and laughed a couple of times while listening to it. I particularly liked the last part where Bryson explores the differences between American and British English and the ‘rivalry’ from its speakers. I guess this is something that is familiar to those of us who were born in former colonies -either from the UK, Spain or France, to name a few- and that not withstanding the centuries after our independence, we still receive comments from the Motherland in the sense that we don’t speak the correct form of the language, implying we speak an ‘impure’ form. Bryson points out how the US accent and vocabulary have been seen as ‘inferior English’. Even in non speaking English countries, we tend to idolize the British accent as more ‘sophisticated’ -well at least I have done it. However, I have come to realize how silly this is -like saying Spanish from Spain is better than the one spoken in Mexico, or Colombia, or Chile, something with which I obviously do not agree. Truth is, every language is a living thing and as such, it evolves, changes and grows, depending on the time, the historical context, and people. Languages are not static and therefore, it is a snob thing to believe a particular accent or form of the language is the correct one. All forms of language are important and reflect the way of living, thoughts and beliefs of a group of people and for that reason alone, we should not criticize or thing one form is better than the other. In this sense, English has been a very open language (unlike Spanish) accepting words from other languages, being flexible and taking on influences to keep expanding. It has done so to such an extend that there is not Language Academy for English. Definitely worth a read.__Disfruto mucho los libros que tratan sobre la historia de los idiomas y este no fue la excepción. Bryson hace un muy buen trabajo relatando el origen del inglés, sus muchas influencias y su crecimiento a través de los siglos así como sus cambios. En resumen, me parece que este libro es un recuento entretenido de la historia de la lengua inglesa, con muchos detalles interesantes y su evolución hasta convertirse en uno de los idiomas más importantes a nivel mundial. Porque, nos guste o no, la realidad es que el inglés es un idioma universal por que, con todas sus complejidades, es relativamente fácil de aprender y ha evolucionado de tal forma que ha eliminado muchas de las reglas gramaticales que hacen a otras lenguas muy complejas -como el alemán o japonés, por mencionar algunas. Me gustó este libro porque, desde siempre, me ha fascinado el inglés y, al no ser mi lengua materna, realmente he aprendido a apreciar las bondades de esta lengua, y las facilidades que nos da a aquellos que la aprendemos como segundo idioma. Por ejemplo, nunca dejará de sorprenderme qué fácil es escribir algo sumamente poético en inglés y no sonar ‘cursi’, porque en español vaya que es difícil lograrlo. Cabe destacar que el libro está algo desactualizado -fue escrito a principios de los noventas, pero la investigación es bastante sólida y brinda mucha información de forma accesible lo cual permite aprender hechos y datos interesantes, incluso divertidos. Por ejemplo, en una parte nos cuenta sobre el origen del ‘acento inglés’ que fue de alguna manera inventado por las clases altas de Inglaterra alrededor del siglo XVIII para diferenciarse de las clases bajas. De esta forma, me pareció una lectura muy amena y me reí un par de veces mientras lo escuchaba. También me gustó mucho la última parte en donde Bryson explora las diferencias entre el inglés de Estados Unidos y el de Gran Bretaña y la ‘rivalidad’ que ha existido entre sus hablantes. Esta situación es familiar para aquellos de nosotros que nacimos en ex colonias, ya sea de Inglaterra, España o Francia, por nombrar algunas, y que, al parecer, a pesar que han pasado siglos desde la independencia, aun es frecuente escuchar desde la Madre Patria respectiva, comentarios de que no hablamos la ‘forma correcta’ del idioma, sugiriendo que hablamos una forma ‘impura’. Bryson señala cómo el acento de Estados Unidos y su vocabulario son vistos como un inglés inferior. Incluso en los países que no somos de habla inglesa, hemos tendido a idealizar el ‘acento inglés’, es decir, el británico, viéndolo como algo mas sofisticado. Bueno, por lo menos es algo que yo he hecho. Sin embargo, me he dado cuenta que esto es algo realmente tonto, como decir que el español de España es mejor que el que se habla en México, Colombia o Chile, lo cual es falso, discriminatorio y algo en lo que no creo. La cuestión es que, en nuestros arranques puristas sobre la lengua, solemos olvidar que todos los idiomas son entes vivos y como tal, evolucionan, cambian y crecen, dependiendo del periodo histórico, el contexto social y la gente. Las lenguas no son estáticas y creo que es algo snob creer que un acento en particular o forma del idioma es la correcta y mejor que otra. Todas las formas del idioma son importantes y reflejan una forma de vivir, creencias y pensamientos de una población y por esa única razón, no debemos criticar ni pensar qué hay una correcta forma de hablar un idioma. En este sentido, también creo que el inglés es mucho más flexible que el español en cuanto a aceptar nuevos términos, nuevas expresiones e influencias. Basta decir que ni siquiera cuentan con una Real Academia de la Lengua. Una lectura muy recomendable. "

I mean, what would you choose, assuming you were emperor of the world, a small, population-controlled mountain kingdom where the art was fantastic, or the vast, barbarian plains, where everyone got fed? I think in many ways if you did have absolute control over the world in this thought-experiment, you would create policies that looked after the large group of people, but you'd make special concessions for the better-developed valley kingdom. there's the Sino-Japanese situation in a nutshell.aside from this issue, there is also the question of the fate of the Western world at large. we can accept, even as members of the Anglophone world, that our civilization has turned the corner and is clearly degenerating. whatever technological breakthroughs Google.com or Apple or Microsoft will introduce in 2020, nothing is going to overall stop the entropy, the collapse, the reversion to stricter policing. sooner or later, we're going to have to get used to continuous CCTV surveillance of all public spaces, and sooner or later some new horrific terror group is going to launch an ever greater atrocity than the ones already dreamed of. but, that being the case, we're still left with some sorts of agreement, some forms of partnership, some forms of common humanity. we may be entering a world with increasing vulgarity and crasser commercialisation, but at least there'll be touchy-feely moments too, and possibly a joint-stock operation for all. that's the spirit of spiritually-informed capitalism. that's our answer to continuous revolution.since presumably I'm going to be losing some slight touch with this website over the next two weeks, then, I guess it doesn't completely hurt to summarize things as they were. slightly better weather means slightly more comfortable clothes. lots of bike riding is good exercise and thoughts about the origin and fate of the world don't add up to a Malraux novel, but at least even if we find evidence of shifts towards radicalisation on both the left and right, there's always the consolations of literature and self-awareness. like possibly I'm doing the worst possible thing tightening up BAE security. but a Eurocopter Dauphin passed overhead the other day, and its tail rotor, being enclosed in a fenestron, made very very little sound. so who knows? who can object?epater les bourgeoisie epater les bourgeoisie"
286,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7074096-shane-moore,2,"Bryson is neither a linguist or a historian. Neither am I, but I mention his lack of credentials because he makes many mistakes in those areas with utter confidence.I would like to say that anything which Bryson claims without a specific citation should be considered unfounded rumor, but I'm not terribly confident that all of his citations are from sound sources. In fact, considering his misunderstanding of what I thought were common words I'm not certain that his citations from reliable sources would actually back him up.  The following example especially annoyed me: ""A rich vocabulary carries with it a concomitant danger of verbosity, as evidenced by our peculiar affection for redundant phrases, expressions that say the same thing twice: beck and call, law and order, assault and battery, null and void, safe and sound, first and fore-most. . ."" Bryson is wrong that these terms are redundant. They each convey two related ideas in order to form a complete impression. A beck is a gestural request (as in beckon) while a call is verbal. Law refers the formal codified rules of society while order describes the general state of organization and a lack of chaos. Assault means an attack (including an attempted or threatened attack), while battery clarifies that actual physical violence was initiated. When something is made null it loses all past efficacy (as in a nullified contract, whose terms are considered never to have been valid), while to void something removes all future efficacy (as a used coupon might be voided). Safe means not in danger, and sound means unharmed. First is a time-related term implying subsequent tasks, while foremost specifies importance and implies less important tasks. Bryson actually continues with many more phrases incorrectly identified as redundant, but I will spare you the additional pedantry. My point is that Bryson often makes this sort of incorrect claim and expounds on it at length. He doesn't only make cursory mistakes, he makes fundamental errors and then draws conclusions from them.The book is also, through no fault of its author, 23 years out-of-date. It was published in 1991 and right at the beginning it asserts that more than 300 million people in the world speak English. Estimates of the number of people who speak English in the world today range from 500 million to more than double that number. Later on the book asserts that 40 or 50 million people in India speak English. For comparison, according to Wikipedia there are over 125 million English speakers in India, 90 million in Pakistan, and 30 million in Bangladesh. All of the speculation about the ways that English might diverge into unintelligible regional variants seem ridiculous viewed through the lens of the internet.On top of all that the book is generally unstructured, apart from the general themes of the chapters. It constantly ranges between historical anecdotes, discussions of grammatical rules, and observations about amusing names. While I enjoyed it, I find it impossible to recommend."

You know the one I'm talking about, the ""English is Weird"" list. Here. ...Because I care.This book was basically an extended version of that. With some cussing.I've found the other stuff by Bryson to be much more readable, which isn't to say I didn't enjoy this. I did. But sometimes his lists could have/ should have been condensed. If we can get the point and understand the concept with 3 or for examples, there's no need to give us the 30 or 40 that you've found.Being familiar with a couple languages myself, I wondered how much less people who aren't familiar with other languages would get out of it. For instance, it's nice to know what is meant by masculine and feminine nouns. And what is meant by English grammarians being tied to Latin rules when they say you can't split an infinitive. In English an infinitive is two words: to run. In Latin: currere. It's one word. Or Spanish: correr. One word. In Croatian: trcati. One word. So, if I want to blatantly ignore this rule in English, I can. If I wanted to quickly run to the store, that's what I'd do. But I couldn't corr-quickly-er in Spanish. You know?Stuff like this popped up all over the place, and I wondered how much more I was picking up than others in my group who only spoke English. Or how much less I picked up than those who spoke fluent Portuguese and Spanish. (Must everything in life be a contest?)I'd learned quite a bit. Living in Haiti for quite a while, I always thought of Creole as their official language. I didn't realize Creole is a type of languages.I thought his argument that the confusing spellings in English are actually a good thing was sound. Context clues give you a lot, but differences in spelling add to clarity. You've got two real eyes: this. If we had a completely uniform and phonetic spelling, we'd gain something, but we'd lose something as well.I noticed Bryson make some mistakes in the book. Although, I admit after looking into a couple of them, the mistake was occasionally mine... Still it was enough to make me question greater parts of it. It's tough when that doubt creeps in.There was a lot to pull out of this book. Good, intellectual stuff. But also things like, ""The City of London once had an alley favored by prostitutes called Gropecuntlane."" (p. 217) Or Chaucer used spelled a certain word found in the middle of that alley's name, ""Kent."" Who knows if this knowledge will ever come in handy. No doubt 15 years from now, those will be the trivial pieces I'll be able to recall learning from this book."

But I have rarely come across a non-fiction book with so many factual errors. Embarrassingly many.Among many other things, Bryson claims that* Almost everyone agrees that English possesses more sounds than almost any other language. (He goes on to say that English has about 44 distinct sounds. Compare that to the 141 sounds of the Taa language of Botswana.)* Esperanto has no definite article. (It does have a definite article, but lacks an indefinite article.)* The vowel sound in her, sir, blur is unique to English. (It is not.)* J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit trilogy. (No, he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings trilogy.)* Only in English can you make compounds that allow you to distinguish between ""boathouse"" and ""houseboat"". (You can also do this in Danish and, I presume, most other Germanic languages.)...and so on, and so on.The number of egregious errors means that as a source of information the book is virtually useless. When you come across an interesting piece of information, you feel obliged to ask yourself, ""Is this information also a falsehood?"""

We have a lot in common: expatriated mid-Westerners, sense of humor, love of travel, similar interests. So when I saw this book in an airport bookstore, I decided to take the plunge.Generally speaking, it was a good book; a well organized survey of the field. I truly enjoyed several parts of it. But, alas, it didn't reach out and grab me and, for the first time in a long time, I finished a book feeling that I didn't get my money's worth (perhaps the fact that the book was in an over-priced airport bookstore contributed, but it's not the only reason).I was distracted early on by his explanations of certain word usage in Australia and Japan which, from my own experiences in those places, I know to be incorrect or inaccurate. Needless to say, this caused me to question the accuracy of other information in the book, which was a further distraction.I think next time I'll try one of Bryson's travel-related books and see if he does better with that."
290,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3987635-lea-ann,4,"If you're a literary or linguistics nerd like I am, then you'll probably appreciate The Mother Tongue as much as I did. I found if fascinating and hilarious at the same time. English as a language, written and spoken, comes from a variety of sources, some legitimate and others, less so. But it's all come together to make the complex rules and pronunciations we love and love to hate today.It seems that scholars have been predicting a split in British and American English for decades and as yet, the two cultures miraculously can still understand one another. Seems like some predictions just never come true. The book was published in 1990 and it could use some updating. Why not a whole chapter on how texting has further influenced our Anglophone penchant for shortening words and phrases. Otherwise I loved learning where some of our more familiar idioms and phrases came from. "
291,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41469235-victoria,4,"Great news: my reading slump is finally over! And even though it took me some time to finish it I really liked this book! I read this book because my boss, who’s American, recommended it to me, and I do not regret the purchase. It still had a few things that bothered me, mainly that some of his French examples are false (at least in 2020 French), some of the words he used to differentiate French and English, I’ve honestly never heard of... And the other thing that bothered me is that the book is almost 40 years old, which might make some of the things he said outdated. But this one is not his fault.You can find my entire review right here: https://reviewswithsprinkles.com/2020..."
292,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284485-kara,2,"This rating is for the audiobook only.I love Bryson. He's one of my favorite nonfiction writers. I think he's funny and informative, and I've enjoyed every other book of his I've read. But this makes an awful audiobook. The narrator has to spell so many words out that it's virtually nonsensical. And the book was written in 1990 originally and hasn't withstood the test of time. On top of that, Bryson made some pretty clear mistakes when talking about languages he's unfamiliar with (I noticed Japanese in particular) that were fairly annoying.I might recommend this book in physical form but would certainly avoid the audiobook."
293,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3431730-andrew,1,"I quit reading this book after reading a short list of all the errors in the book. Bryson certainly isn't a linguist, but he doesn't appear to be much of a researcher either: http://everything2.com/title/The+Moth..."

295,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5667548-alicia,5,Oh goodness what an interesting read. Bill Bryson has such a way of making dense material accessible for all readers. I looked up my last name after reading this- my family were tailors. My boyfriends family were bath house bathers 😂😂😂Very great and interesting read. 
296,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400971-crystal,4,"Some chapters caught my interest more than others, but this is packed full of interesting linguistics and examples. My favorite was the section on swearing!"
297,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970499-thekelburrows,4,"Reading Bill Bryson is incredibly comforting. Also, I did not know that ""asparagus"" was called originally known as ""sparrow grass"" until the name morphed over time."
298,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176122-stuart-aken,4,"Subtitled, ‘English and How it Got That Way’, this is typical Bryson wit and erudition at his best. I confess, I was tempted initially to disagree with some of his numbers on the speaking of English, but a quick gander at Google soon put me right on that issue.The book is divided into 16 chapters plus an extensive bibliography and a very full index. Bryson tackles some diverse subjects, covering ‘The World’s Language’, ‘Where Words Come From’, ‘Good English and Bad’, and ‘Swearing’, amongst the many topics. With his usual good humour and in-depth research, he explains how language came about, how it developed and how English became the most widely-spoken tongue in the world today. He also looks at its future and, as usual, is optimistic about this in spite of the many commentators who seem intent on predicting decline, chaos and ultimate death for the language.There were many places where I laughed out loud when reading. I learned things of which I was previously ignorant, had some of my most heartfelt beliefs brought into question, discovered things every writer and reader should know relating to the grammar police, and generally came away from the reading experience both enthused and educated.It’s a great book and one everyone who declares an interest in their home language should read. I especially recommend that writers get hold of a copy and actually read it. It will be far from a waste of time, I promise you. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
299,0380715430,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579636-garver,4,"Thanks to Oliver for putting this one up here. It's a great tour of the history of the English language, from its origins to its current diffusion as the de facto business language of the world. The story of English is told with Bryson's characteristic wit and mother tongue-in-cheek asides -- though the book is a bit outdated and contains some points now known to be apocryphal. I prefer nonfiction that changes the way you put things in context, that gives you a new lens to view everyday things. What [The Blind Watchmaker] did for biology and the living world, what Omnivore's Dilemma did for food, Mother Tongue has done for the way I read and listen to others -- and has given me a new appreciation when listening to ESOL speakers try to articulate what should be a simple thought. More than anything, however, it has affirmed my belief that language is as much a way to have fun obfuscating thought as it is a way to clearly and effectively communicate it, and I look forward to a future of conducting cognitive warfare on my soon-to-be-former friends"
