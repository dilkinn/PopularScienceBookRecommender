0,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,5,"I decided to buy this book after watching a short Ted Talk featuring Michael Shermer in which he discussed the origins of belief. A natural born skeptic with two science based degrees who often finds herself wanting to believe (a huge X-files fan), I am fascinated by how people come to hold certain beliefs that on the surface appear flawed or irrational. So that said, this book appealed to me on many levels.On a personal level, I have a special interest in religious belief. Raised a Christian, I grew up attending church and going to private, religious-based schools. In fact, I went through high school with only being aware of one ""true"" non-believer, a father of a friend. Back then the idea that someone would have the gall to be an atheist blew me away. Yet somewhere along the way, my belief in God simply deteriorated and I found myself grappling with the ""A"" word. During my journey, I have gone through many stages of belief and disbelief. First I believed everything wholeheartedly and literally, but then as a kid I also believed in Santa Claus. As I got older, I found that I could no longer accept the Bible as literal, but still hung onto the belief of God and Christ. Then over the years, it became impossible for me to accept even the most basic foundation of Christian Theology (the divinity of Christ)any longer. The religions were all too similar, not just to each other but also to past mythologies (for example: the similarities between Christ and mythological gods like Dionysus are just too many to be coincidence.) I realized that had I been born to Muslim parents, I would have a been a Muslim, born to Buddhists parents, a Buddhist. I also could not accept that an all-powerful, all-knowing, and loving God would need to be worshiped or would punish his imperfect creations for their imperfections. It became obvious to me that religion and gods are man-made. Quite frankly I found religious teachings rather simplistic and boring when held up against the freaking awesomeness of the universe we now know exists. That's when I started to define myself as spiritual, until I asked myself exactly what that meant. Then I got to where I am now, a skeptical, non-theist who would like to believe in things like God, and Heaven, and an Afterlife and maybe even Ghosts and ESP and the like, but feels that there is no real, rational, scientific evidence to support living a life that treats those things as real, even if possible (though unlikely). I've also found I don't need a god to give my life meaning or purpose.This puts me at odds with my family and many in my inner circle, so I wanted to understand why I don't believe when they do. What happened?That being my starting point, I found this book to be an excellent read. Shermer gives a detailed account of the neurobiology and neurophysiology of belief. Yes, even belief is nothing more than a firing of neurons in the brain. He discusses and provides evidence for the evolutionary foundation of our belief and why beliefs are often irrational and not based on fact. He claims the belief often comes first and the evidence later. Furthermore, we are creatures of bias who are hard wired to find patterns and find meaning in it all, which leads us to see patterns that don't exist and attribute meaning when there is none. We tend to attribute unexplained phenomena to magic or supernatural forces when historically we know that just because we can't explain something yet doesn't mean it doesn't have a good and rational explanation.He then goes on to discuss belief in supernatural phenomena, including things like religion and the paranormal. He even takes some time to discuss the neurobiology as it relates to political beliefs. Shermer describes himself as a skeptic and a libertarian, who lives his life as an atheist (he claims you either live as if there is a particular god or you don't - practically speaking). He shares his own personal views and acknowledges his own bias, though it should be noted he has spent much of his life investigating the claims of the supernatural. Still, much of the book is the presentation of data from many different scientific sources. The crux of his book is that we generally, but not always, believe first (whether because of indoctrination and/or societal influences) and seek confirmation for our beliefs later (often by cherry picking and employing understood biases) and that we need to start using science (that which we can systematically confirm and prove/disprove) and not beliefs (that which we know are irrational and flawed), as our litmus moving forward, understanding why we do the things we do and maybe believe the crazy stuff we believe. He points to the erroneous nature of past beliefs (even when science was employed) to support the need for continued and vigilant skepticism, but acknowledges that skepticism is often discouraged. In fact, he notes skepticism is seen as being noncommittal and wishy-washy, and instead we are encouraged to confirm and assimilate to the group and group dogma. Group-think provides cohesiveness, while skepticism challenges the status-quo and threatens perceived stability.Bottom line: There is still a lot we don't know, but not knowing is not an excuse for making stuff up. Science isn't perfect and does change, but it's the best tool in the tool box. As Einstein suggested, our Gods should only start where our science ends. If science can explain it, then we need to be able and/or willing to adapt our ""gods"" accordingly, whatever those ""gods"" are. This book might be alienating to a person of faith or someone who is a staunch believer in the paranormal as Shermer does present a strong case against the likelihood of deities and knowing what deities want, as well as paranormal phenomena. However, if you are open-minded, you will find he doesn't attack belief as much as he tries to explain it, which may seem like nothing more than semantics but I think an important distinction.Shermer's discussion of politics also resonated with me, and I found after reading his argument that I was more sensitive to the ""other side"". According to him, we are two sides of the same coin, or perhaps the left and right arm of the same body yet functioning from the same complicated and emotional brain.I wanted to end with a quote, which is hard in retrospect since I highlighted about a third of the book. Yeah, it spoke to me. So I will go with Shermer's closing remarks, which I feel capture the essence of the book.
In the end, all of us are trying to make sense of the world, and nature has gifted us with a double-edged sword that cuts for and against. On one edge, our brains are the most complex and sophisticated information-processing machines in the universe, capable of understanding not only the universe itself but also the process of understanding. On the other edge, by the very same process of forming beliefs about the universe and ourselves, we are also more capable than any other species of self-deception and illusion, of fooling ourselves even while we are trying to avoid being fooled by nature.

 In the end I want to believe. I also want to know. The truth is out there, and although it may be difficult to find, science is the best tool we have for uncovering it.
I would recommend this book to skeptics and/or those who are interested in brain and behavior and brain science in general, as well as anyone who is willing to challenge their own personal gods - whether those gods be religious, political, or personal - by seeking a deeper understanding of why we are who we are.______Extras(view spoiler)[Here is a link about political bias that I thought was extremely interesting and relevant to topics discussed in the book.Another Partisan Divide: Mitt Romney's Looks (hide spoiler)]"
1,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,2,"Here's the tl;dr review: If you're looking for the ways that we tend to trick ourselves and how to deal with that reality, see Predictably Irrational or The Power of Habit. Shermer's book is definitely not the book for that.Now the full review:I was really excited about this book. I was hoping that it would update and extend Consciousness Explained with contemporary neuroscience about belief. That was, after all, exactly how the book billed itself through the marketing coverage and through the first couple of chapters.And, to be fair to the book, there is a fair bit about that going on. I know more about the neuroscience of belief than I did when I started. The science content — which is almost entirely found within the first half of the book — is why this book got two stars instead of one. It's a great book to get some general ideas and get the names of other interesting things to go research. The basic idea that Shermer is pushing is that we choose our opinions first and justify them later, which seems obvious to me. What this amounts to for Shermer is that we decide our opinions based on non-scientific evidence and then have an expectation that science should justify them, and we've got in-built biases that help construct a fitting reality. Once that clarification is in place (Shermer does not supply it), Shermer does a really nice job proving it out in Part II.The book is also very accesible without being childish. Shermer has a great writing style and his voice manages to remain friendly even when tackling highly controversial topics in a fairly confrontational way.But that's about all the positive stuff I can say about this book. Beyond that, the book is basically a tour de force of philosophical and anti-religious errors. It's the most adroit, masterful presentation of all the problems with the so-called ""skeptic"" culture that I am yet to see. Ripping this book a new one could easily be the final project for an undergraduate class on post-modernism or post-colonialism. Let me highlight some of the glaring failings which are still pissing me off, in roughly the order that they really bug me.First and foremost, the God Helmet, which Shermer treats at length. Seriously, people, let this one go. The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul demolished the God Helmet, revealing it as the pseudoscience that it is. Persinger is a de facto huckster selling a magic device to skeptics, and they're eating it up. Shermer falls into the trap, too, and proceeds to announce that the God Helmet ""may be the first step toward demystifying a number of centuries-old puzzles."" The problem is the God Helmet has never successfully been repeated. Even using Persinger's own equipment, teams other than Persinger could not get the kind of results he found. In short, the more controlled the experiment, the less the effect of the God Helmet. This is precisely Shermer's critique of the experiments around psychic phenomenon. It's a totally warranted and valid critique of psychic experiments. But it's also a totally warranted and valid critique of the God Helmet. Shermer fails to apply his own skeptic standards to a device which he is inclined to believe, instead presenting us solely with his anecdotal experience and a heaping gob of praise. If Shermer is going to call himself a skeptic, then he needs to actually be skeptical of everything evenly, including and especially those things he wants to be true. The only good thing about the God Helmet example is the irony: he fell into this trap because he wanted it to be true while writing a book about how people fall into traps by wanting to believe. So it shows Shermer is as human and fallible and self-delusional as he's casting everyone else to be, too.Second, Shermer's handling of philosophically loaded jargon and concepts is desperately in need of work. In the first chapter, he disparages philosophy in favor of science (as though they are mutually exclusive), and then proceeds to not just stumble across philosophical hornets' nests, but to actually seek out those hornets' nests and stick sensitive, squishy body parts right into the hole until he's sure he's been stung. It's insane. The most obvious example is his monism. He says that he is a monist—that all that exists is the physical activity of the brain. Fine. Unfortunately, the only defensible monist position vis a vis subjectivity is to deny it outright: for a monist, the only philosophically safe position is to say that subjectivity simply does not exist. You are not a subjective person. You have no subjective experience. Descartes was just wrong. This is Daniel Dennett's take, and Shemer cites Dennett in footnotes, but apparently Shermer missed Dennett's actual point. Instead, Shermer gives a delightful performance as a pseudo-dualist, using terms like ""conscious"" vs. ""subconscious"" (which Dennett clearly explains is an erroneous distinction for a monist), ""became aware"", and even ""qualia"". He even talks about a sense of free will! But the ""qualia"" example is the most glaring demonstration—Shermer asserts that qualia are purely chemical reactions (pg 116), which is a pretty astounding assertion, since neither science nor philosophy has come up with any way of accounting how one gets subjective experience (qualia) out of a chemical soup. Despite that radical assertion, Shermer gives no justification...which isn't surprising, since there is none to give. What is surprising is that Shemer makes the claim in the first place: apparently monism and promissory materialism doesn't deserve skeptical treatment by Shermer.Third, Shermer fails to even handle his own terms well. He defines two terms: agenticity and patternicity, which seem to have promise as descriptors, but then he proceeds to use them inconsistently with his own definitions. Agenticity is apparently the projection of an agent onto experience: this is sometimes warranted (e.g. other people), sometimes not (e.g. wind in grass). But then Shermer treats expecting the recently deceased person to be present in their home as a kind of agenticity. That's not agenticity: it's not the projection of an agent. That's just a disappointed expectation or altered habituation. Other examples are easy to find as you work the book: just keep his technical definition of those terms at hand, and compare that to the way he uses them. Because of this sloppiness, Shermer ends up coming across as not even really knowing what he's even talking about with his own ideas — either that, or speaking out of both sides of his mouth.Fourth, the book takes a massive turn for the worse about half way through. All the science falls out of it, and it basically falls in quality to a level below most science news blogs. It's just ranting opinion stuff without justification or warrant. The conclusion pulls things together a bit, but by that point, the damage has really been done.Fifth, the book panders to evolutionary psychology like it's science, but it's not. There's no Popperian falsifiability to evolutionary psychology — that is, there is no experiment which could prove theories in evolutionary psychology wrong. Instead, people tell narratives and try to argue that the narratives make sense. But that's not science: that's philosophy. And all you need to remind yourself that evolutionary psychology is lame is to remember that the aquatic ape hypothesis is still a viable evolutionary psychology hypothesis. Worse, Shermer demonstrates his failure to grok evolutionary psychology when he calls it a ""full fledged science"" (pg. 42): it's not a science at all, but insofar as it is used in science, it is as a framework, not a discipline (that's according to Tooby and Cosmides themselves in Behavioral and Brain Sciences 2007, 30:1, pg. 42-43). But Shermer, following others like Dawkins and Dennett, want to laud evolutionary psychology because of some misguided idea that it disproves something about religion or faith.Sixth, Shermer is so locked up in the modern worldview that he's busy fighting ghosts of arguments that perished two centuries ago. This is reflected in the very way he frames his core thesis: that we form beliefs first and go looking for evidence later. This is nonsense, as he well knows — the use of the ACC (the brain region, not the NCAA division) means that the brain is processing evidence. What Shermer means is that the we form beliefs without consulting science, and then we accept scientific evidence later. This, of course, is obvious: the brain doesn't have a capability for objective/intersubjective thought, even granting the existence of mirror neurons. There is no repeatable experiment performing homunculus in the brain that spends its downtime reading journals published by other repeatable experiment performing homunculus within other people's brains. Scientific evidence — like all intersubjective evidence and most rational argumentation — reaches the brain through hijacking the primal systems. So when we are forced to construct a belief, our only option is to do so through non-scientific systems. Once we construct a belief, though, that belief is a part of our reality, and so any additional evidence is forced to conform with the reality, or we're left with cognitive dissonance. (And the brain doesn't like cognitive dissonance.) Once a neural network is built, reconstructing/modifying it is difficult, and so the brain prefers to kludge in new facts and cling to existing beliefs rather than destroy existing beliefs in favor of the new facts. It's just how we're wired. But for Shermer and his modernism, ""evidence"" just means ""scientific evidence"", and so he misses this entire cognitive process because he wants to cling to the long since debunked Enlightenment idea of human cognition somehow grokking science directly. This modernism blindness also completely wrecks his treatment of dualism. That treatment is pathetically out of date: Shermer has clearly never read John R. Searle when he tries to argue that dualism is somehow hurt by evidence that the brain impacts the mind (the mind which, remember, Shermer should be denying even exists!).Finally, Shermer basically participates in all the standard Eurocentric, semi-racist, modern ideas which post-modern and post-colonial critiques have ripped to shreds. It's infuriating to see him—a thought leader in this ""skeptic"" community—failing to acknowledge the legitimate and valid critiques of the project which he is engaged on. And a lot of it is purely superficial stuff which could be modified without losing any kind of core motivation to the project. The most blatant single example of his modernism is when he says that current practices of hunter-gatherer societies are models for our paleolithic ancestors — as though those cultures have been doing nothing for the past 10,000 years but sitting on their thumbs and waiting to be discovered by Europeans. In another place, Shermer presents the Neadrathals possessing Europe for centuries yet not developing culture as evidence of their weak-mindedness — as though Europe itself contains some kind of magic that's not found in Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia. Also, there's a problem with the extensive argument that Shermer builds based on the assumed universal role of a god as judge of the good and the bad: that problem being that such an idea is pretty much unique (or at least central) to the monotheistic religions. It's so wrong that it isn't even Euro-centric, but even more limited than that: even the Greeks didn't have a concept that Zeus was going to get you if you secretly betrayed your society—unless, of course, someone in that society had an in with Zeus and tattled on you, or Zeus happened to be paying attention to you personally at the moment! So that entire way of thinking is just plain empirically erroneous. The idea that science can be the be-all, end-all of knowledge is an idea that has been roundly destroyed by pretty much everyone working post-Nietzsche, and it's especially unforgivable in a post-MacIntyre world. But, of course, Shermer doesn't notice any of these issues, because modernism doesn't deserve the same kind of skepticism that everything else does.This book was a horrid failure, and it should be an embarrassment for an author who claims to be a critical thinker. The fourth through sixth chapters have some interesting stuff, but everything else is straight up dangerous, because it's compellingly written but profoundly and painfully wrong even by its own skeptical standards. The worst part is that Shermer is a thought leader and writes in an extremely accessible and convincing style, even as he spews bad philosophy and calls it science. Because he's so charming, though, people buy it and pass it on — as evidenced by the 5-star reviews here on GoodReads."
2,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"One of the most exciting books I have ever read. The author is a science historian, and writes monthly articles for The Scientific American. What I am going to describe here sounds cold and formal, but the book is written with spirit and vigour, with lots of the author's personal experiences and views included. It pulsates with amazing ideas - and I really relished every word. Basically, it showed that on the upside we humans are amazing thinking animals, capable of using logic and conducting experiments to further our understanding of nature and the world. But on the downside our brains are also designed to veer us towards some extraordinary distortions in thinking.The very things that make us able to make wise judgements about the world, can all too easily lead us to being mildly fanciful, or even bizarrely so. Part of that is the difference in brain structure between individual people, part of it is just our natural way of thinking, which includes a host of weird and odd biases.There was so much I got from this book .......* Descriptions of how our brains work.* The mechanics of how we think.* Descriptions of the role of religion in our lives from an evolutionary standpoint.* Descriptions of how our thinking is distorted. (Absolutely fascinating!)* Provocative scenarios given, which even made an old rationalist like myself realise how much of my thinking is irrational and emotional.* A wonderful exploration of the basic psychological building blocks of religion and politics,* An explanation of the core difference between the main political parties, and the psychology which drives people to want to be affiliated with one or the other. * The hormonal response which accompanies the sense of falling in love with someone (an experience found only in monogamous, pair-bonded species.)* The scientific ideas explaining hallucinations and conspiracy theories.* A celebration of science and the scientific method as our best way forward.Finally, a little scenario presented in the book.What would you do if asked to wear for a while a jumper that belonged to a children's TV presenter? versus What would you do if asked to wear a jumper that belonged to a sadistic, violent murderer?Many people (me included) would only feel comfortable with the TV presenter's jumper, yet rationally (and very obviously), it makes no difference whatsoever. You don't catch things from jumpers.Apparently people who have transplants feel the same. They don't want transplants from people we consider degenerates.This is just one of the descriptions in the book that helps the reader see their own thinking biases.....I am concerned that this review has been much too pedestrian, and that I have failed to do justice to this amazing book. Please, pick it up, and see for yourself what a wonderfully good read it is.P.S. By the way, I found the last few chapters of the book, detailing the history of astronomy and its discoveries, boring, (I can't get into anything to do with astronomy), and I skipped those. It did nothing to detract from the wonderfulness of the bulk of the book..."
3,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent, comprehensive examination of the things we believe, and why. It is a very well-written, well-organized book with a unifying theme: we form our beliefs, and then we rationalize them with explanations. We initially formulate our beliefs through two processes: patternicity and agenticity. Patternicity allows us to form all sorts of weird beliefs, including the whole gamut of superstitions. For example, if something bad happens when a black cat crosses your path, and at a later time something else bad happens in the presence of a black cat, it is natural for one to see ""a pattern"". And, when we see a pattern--even in a series of coincidental occurrences--we often ascribe agenticity to it. We attach a special meaning, or ascribe the occurrence to an agent who has intentionally willed it to happen. Beliefs in haunted houses, lucky sweaters, seances, aliens, ghosts, and a host of other phenomena are due to agenticity.Shermer shows how the biology of the brain and chemicals that activate neurons in certain regions of the brain can play a big part in forming our beliefs. Belief in the afterlife, in God, in aliens, in conspiracies, and political beliefs are all discussed in some detail. A whole host of biases in our beliefs are described.Toward the end of the book, our scientific beliefs are described. The history of cosmology is told in some detail, offering insights into how old paradigms hold sway for years-decades-centuries-even millennia, until science has gathered overwhelming evidence for a better theory.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in how and why people formulate beliefs."
4,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,5,Shermar makes an impressive and convincing argument against belief. Not only religious and political beliefs but also scientific beliefs which makes this book even more special. Any believer may find this book pretty damning to his beliefs. The last chapters were specially informative on the way science was confronted by the Catholic Corporation of the Church. It took the Church around 300 years to finally withdraw their claim against Galileo. No wonder believers are a resilient bunch.

From sensory data flowing in through the senses the brain naturally begins to look for and find patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning. The first process I call patternicity: the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless data. The second process I call agenticity: the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency. We can’t help it. Our brains evolved to connect the dots of our world into meaningful patterns that explain why things happen. These meaningful patterns become beliefs, and these beliefs shape our understanding of reality.Once beliefs are formed, the brain begins to look for and find confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, which adds an emotional boost of further confidence in the beliefs and thereby accelerates the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive feedback loop of belief confirmation.Belief dependant realism---2.

6,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/726203-ellen,2,"This book bills itself as ""why people believe weird things,"" but it's really more of ""why you shouldn't believe weird things."" It should be noted that I don't actually believe in any of the things discussed in the book (God, heaven, hell, and other religious things; UFOs and alien abductions; conspiracy theories, esp. 9/11 conspiracy theories), so the arguments against were tedious at best, and I gained no insight into why other people do believe them.Shermer's tone comes across as defensive (and, to be honest, rather arrogant), particularly when he's recounting his own ""journey"" from belief to skepticism and when he's quoting from others who argue against him, then pointing out why they're wrong. This is not so much a scientific exploration of an interesting psychological topic as a manifesto about everyone the author thinks is crazy. The ""Politics of Belief"" chapter was particularly (and rather offensively) bizarre; the thesis of most chapters is ""there's a right and a wrong, and science will tell us which is which,"" while the thesis of that chapter seemed to be, ""there's no right and wrong, but here's why you should be a libertarian like me anyway."" Shermer ought to apply his analysis to his own beliefs; he seems to be under the impression that he alone forms opinions based on rational, unemotional reasoning.ALL THAT SAID, there were some interesting bits and even whole chapters. I wish the book had been entirely about what it claims to be about and divided up by topic -- ""Patternicity,"" ""Agenticity,"" ""Confirmation Bias,"" etc. -- without all the rest of the nonsense."
7,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I have been following Michael Shermer's column in ""Scientific American"" for years. It's the first thing in the magazine that I read. This book definitely did not dissapoint. Shermer starts off with anecdotes and then goes into the very specific. Oft repeated throughout the book is that belief comes first, rationalization of the beliefs afterward. First we decide to believe, then the evidence collected tends to support what we believe. This is regardless if the subject is religion, paranormal, UFO's or politics. Shermer explains that our brains are pattern seeking and some people are disposed toward connecting dots even when there is no pattern (patternicity). Humans also ""infuse patterns with meaning, intention and agency"", ""agenticity"". We want to believe things and so we do. I found chapter 11, ""Politics of Belief"" particularly illuminating. Apparantely I'm a liberal because out of the following five moral foundations - harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect and purity/sanctity, I am mostly in favor of the first two. Like other liberals. In a study based on 118240 people, liberals score the highest on harm/care and fairness/reciprocity and lower than conservatives on the last three. Fascinating! I found this book highly informative and quite amusing, although I'm sure some people would hate it. Your believing brains have chosen another truth and will not be swayed. I try to live my life on the basis that I might be wrong about many things, but maybe I am simply self delusional. Somethings will never change and never would I become a conservative politically. Ever. Other things I would change my mind about, if evidence was there and experiments could be repeated. I try to be open minded, but my brains shall not fall out"

11,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,1,"This review should prove that I don't always ""high-side"" my reviewing stars. In fact, let me be blunt — now that I've read one Shermer book, I have no more desire to read further writings of his than I do of Sam Harris, and for somewhat similar reasons. In Shermer's case, here's why.Here's derivative and blind spots intersecting -- Shermer briefly, but briefly talks about Kahneman's and Tversky's study in behavioral economics (without also citing Dan Ariely, among others). One will learn much more about how irrational human behavior is in matters of economics, and related psychology, by going to the source. Shermer could have had a better book with a whole chapter just on this field.So, why didn't he? I suspect because he knows how totally behavioral economics chops into little bitty pieces the claims of his beloved Ayn Rand and the Austrian School of Economics.===Somewhat shallow: His discussion of neurotransmitters/neuroscience is not that deep, and not too far beyond the level of ""depression is a chemical imbalance"" level of understanding.===Somewhat derivative, and possibly somewhat incorrect:His thoughts on the evolution of religious belief owe much to people like Scott Atran or Pascal Boyer. Go to the source; both of them are great authors and should be read without the filter of Shermer. And, given cave paintings of 20,000-30,000 years of age, his claim that religion ""evolved"" about 7,000 years ago is quite likely wrong.===Blind-spotted: His belief in the coming ""Singularity,"" claiming by 2030 there will be a fifth-dimension-like explosion in computing power. Reality? By 2015, many computer engineers and scientists think we'll be bumping against some quantum limits. ""Quantum computing"" has been a buzz word for a decade now; ""peaceful nuclear fusion"" has been even longer, and we don't have that, either.===Blind-spotted, perhaps deliberately: Claiming that ""peak oil"" theories are a conspiracy theory. I suspect this is deliberate self-blinding because it's a threat to his libertarian economics and his cornucopian futurism.===Shallow and willfully blind-spotted: Mentioning libertarianism/Libertarian Party as outside the two-party duopoly without talking about Greens or Socialists.===Just plain wrong: Claiming that the Challenger commission faulting NASA on the O-rings issue is ""hindsight bias."" Au contraire, Mr. Shermer, NASA had had multiple warnings, both from Morton Thiokol and from internal engineers, about possible cold-weather launch dangers before sending Challenger up.This last one isn't even political. It's simply wrong, as a matter of elemental logic and its garbling or misuse by Shermer.Result? I have to question not just how political bias informs Shermer's thinking, but whether he's really that good of a thinker, or instead, a John Loftus who got luckier earlier."
12,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,3,"Up until page 140 this is a 5 star book. These are the pages where the author describes belief as stemming from what he calls patternicity and agenticity. Our minds have evolved to spot patterns. Agenticity is the story we overlay on the patterns. The patterns may be random, yet, if they explain a something very good (a ritual before placing a bet correlates with a few wins) or negative (unlucky clothing or actions) we may ascribe significance to them and they become beliefs. We often have the beliefs first and interpret incoming information in way that confirms them. This holds true for beliefs be they in ESP, ghosts or the teachings of main stream religions.In these first pages, author Michael Shermer also describes the physiology of the brain to demonstrate how patterns are recognized. He cites research on ""locus of control"" that demonstrates basic response differences in brains of believers and non-believers.The middle part of the book is not worthy of the first. The author describes how he, in seminars and on talk shows, ""won"" arguments against believers in god, the afterlife, aliens, and conspiracies, etc. The attitude here is a turn off, and the ""science"" is weak. For instance, for conspiracies he cites an obscure (I had never heard of it) and extreme example of JFK assassination conspiracy (the shooter was a man in a sewer pipe) and there is a point by point refutation of selected claims of 9/11 ""Truthers"". The chapter on the ""Politics of Belief"" reads like a justification of libertarianism as he tries to establish himself as a neutral broker between liberals and conservatives. For this topic, I recommend John Dean's Conservatives without Conscience which lays out a research on the different thinking and personality patterns of liberals and conservatives and stays on topic.There is wordy chapter with a few good insights on ""Confirmation of Belief"", followed by some meandering material on the scientific method that goes into the history of astronomy (the persecution of Galileo, etc.) and other topics.I'm giving this 3 stars on the strength of the book's opening which for a lay person with interest in this topic is a must read. The other 2/3 of the book really brings it down."
13,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377421-heather-denkmire,2,"There were a few books in this book and I only enjoyed one of them. Unfortunately for me, most of the content was repeat information from things I've read/heard before. The first sections dealing with the biology of the brain were interesting.So much of the book (a book in itself) was spent refuting things that don't exist (UFOs, ghosts, god, 9/11 conspiracies, etc.) it was tiresome. I know they don't, I don't need it explained why. This continued on for a long, long time. I almost gave up on the book.I appreciated his honesty, his disclosure of his own background since part of the premise of the book is that belief is formed through brain chemistry that is affected and effected by many variables. There were a few points that were frustrating, like when he obviously misunderstood the Lakoff/Westin books that in my mind agree entirely with his position that belief comes from chemical reactions in the brain and that feelings are integral to forming beliefs (Shermer probably wouldn't like the ""fuzzy"" term ""feelings,"" I suppose).Anyway, it got long-winded as it was so full of disputing theories and disputing false notions. The section on ways we delude ourselves (delude is my word choice) was also too long. He gave labels to about 20 different kinds of reasons people hold faulty beliefs. The labels seemed unnecessary to me, though the anecdotal descriptions were interesting (too many repeated from earlier books, as I mentioned).So, it was so-so."
14,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5240956-richard-palmer,2,"I was hoping that this book would explain the biology and evolution of what makes us believe things. It does do that, but does not stick to that theme. Shermer digresses often and spends a good deal of time debunking beliefs in extraterrestrial visits, ESP, and a lot of pseudoscience. His discussions on religion were thought provoking, and I appreciated that. However, instead of coming back to the idea of why the human race believes things, he concludes with a long discussion of the history of science and illustrations of the scientific method.Though Shermer is entertaining, lucid, and documents his points well, I give the book a low rating in my review because the book did not stick to what I expected its main theme to be."
15,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"I really liked this book and I agreed with most everything in it, and that made me rather uncomfortable just because of what the book is about. Michael Shermer covered a wide range of topics that interest me, from politics to psychology to religion, and i believed every word of what he argued. But... I don't think it's that he convinced me, i think it's that i already held those beliefs going into it, and as the book proclaims repeatedly, i as a human being pay special attention to arguments that support what i already believe.When i was about halfway through the book, i read a review here on Goodreads that warned me not to fall victim while reading it to the very trap that the book warns against; believing so-called ""facts"" just because i want to believe them. So, i tried and failed to see fault with Shermer's logic, and it made me feel like i'm obviously no different form people who hold the opposite views.I wish this book had been shorter and more focused, even though i loved everything in it. Shermer couldn't resist the temptation to single out specific popularly held beliefs—such as the 9/11 conspiracy theory, the idea that extra terrestrials have visited Earth, and the existence of God—and argue their invalidity. And before he does this he admits that it's possible that he sees things the way he does because he, too, is only human and believes what he wants to believe, but he goes ahead and knocks other people's beliefs anyway. Science reveals the truth in any situation, he says, but then he also shows that scientists' findings are sometimes colored by their beliefs, too. So what's a girl to believe? Well, whatever she wants to, it seems. It would've been interesting to learn even more about the believing brain, specifically, rather than what the believing brain tends to believe.Maybe if the tone of the book had just been a little more humble, i would've been able to read it with more confidence. Shermer introduced the book by saying that what was to follow was going to be more ""huh, isn't that interesting?"" and less ""these are the facts and this is how it is,"" but i think the latter is a better representation of the book's attitude. Shermer doesn't just talk about how people form and reinforce their belief in God, for example, but he also essentially declares that God does not in fact exist, and gives his reasons. And as an atheist i'm normally more than fine with that, just not in this particular context. Shermer also apparently likes to take the ideas of actual scientists and coin catchy new terms for them, and it makes him come across as a little overconfident about his stature in the scientific community. I would've liked to have seen Shermer deal with more concrete stuff, like the political topics. I felt like he only touched on politics, and it was mostly to tell me why i should be a libertarian. And i didn't mind that, but i thought that section of the book could've been more in-depth. And while i'm criticizing, i must say that i found the anecdotes at the beginning of the book to be quite unnecessary. Having said all of that, i do think people should read this book. It will shake your belief in whatever you believe in, even if it's nothing. And if it doesn't, well, it should still make you wonder what that says about you and your beautiful brain.I'm sticking a big quote here that i want to save:p. 185This was the argument i made in a Templeton Foundation-sponsored print debate with theist and Harvard professor of medicine Jerome Groopman, who in his comments argued that God is ""without form, immeasurable,"" that he exists ""in a dimension that cannot be quantitated or depicted by science,"" that ""we are unable to grasp fully God's nature and dimensions,"" and that ""God esists outside of time and cannot be bound by space."" How then, I asked, do you know this God exists? As corporeal beings who form beliefs about the wold based on percepts (from our senses) and concepts (from our minds), how can we possibly know a being who by definition lies outside of both our percepts and our concepts? At some point doesn't God need to step into our space-time to make himself known in some manner—say through prayer, providence, or miracles? And if so, why can't science measure such divine action? If there is some other way of knowing, say that of the mystics or the faithful through deep meditation or prayer, why couldn't neuroscience say something meaningful about that process of knowing? If we came to understand—as studies with meditating monks and praying priests have shown—that a part of the parietal lobe of the brain associated with the orientation of the body in space is quiescent during such meditative states (breaking down the normal distinction one feels between self and nonself and thus making one feel ""at one"" with the environment), wouldn't this imply that rather than being in touch with a being outside of space and time, it is actually just a change in neurochemistry? "
16,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book as it offers evidenced based reasons for why we humans are programmed to believe in external agents (when the evidence proves such things are internal in the brain) and why we find patterns where there are none. I find knowing such things comforting and I think I got a little dopamine reward when Shermer confirmed that we experience these things because we share the same brain biology (something I've argued often with regard to religion and other common belief systems).The central thesis is that we believe things first (it's evolutionarily a good idea to make snap decisions) and then look for confirmation to enforce the belief (confirmation bias)....I've caught myself doing this - I always have to questions ideas and try to reduce the bias when I'm solving a problem.The best defence against our many cognitive biases (including the confirmation bias) is the scientific method (I was all excited to see mention of the null hypothesis and type I and II errors because I'm geeky that way). For some odd reason, I've seen people get angry about this & attack the scientific method....I think it's the best one we have for eliminating bias.We need more books like this that inspire critical thinking because a lot of general lazy thinking has resulted in the belief in a lot of harmful pseudo science.Anyway, I think this book is a good, concise way of introducing the above fundamental principles and backs up the assertions with interesting anecdotes. It was a great read and has made me want to read more! "

21,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies by Michael Shermer ""The Believing Brain"" is a fantastic and ambitious book that explains the nature of beliefs. Mr. Shermer provides his theory of belief and with great expertise and skill provides compelling arguments and practical examples in explaining how the process of belief works. He applies his theory to a wide range of types of beliefs and does so with mastery. This excellent 400 page-book is composed of the following four parts: Part I. Journeys of Belief, Part II. The Biology of Belief, Part III. Belief in Things Unseen, and Part IV. Belief in Things Seen. Positives: 1. A fascinating topic in the hands of a master of his craft. 2. Well-written, well-researched, engaging and accessible book. Bravo! 3. Great, logical format. Good use of illustrations. 4. Great use of popular culture to convey sophisticated concepts in an accessible manner. 5. Establishes his theory early on and then proceeds like a great architect building his masterpiece. 6. Great quotes from many great minds, including some of his own, ""What I want to believe based on emotions and what I should believe based on evidence do not always coincide. I'm a skeptic not because I do not want to believe but because I want to know"". 7. Answers the question of ""Why we believe"" to complete satisfaction. 8. A thorough explanation on what the brain is. 9. The first of four parts of this book starts off with three distinctly different routes to belief, including his own revealing journey to beliefs. 10. The concept of patternicity defined. A great take at why our brains evolved to assume that all patterns are real. 11. Insightful and thought-provoking, consider the following ""The problem we face is that superstition and belief in magic are millions of years old, whereas science, with its methods of controlling for intervening variables to circumvent false positives, is only a few hundred years old"". 12. Where would we be without evolution? Great use of science from the best scientific minds. 13. The concept of agenticity defined and how patternicity and agenticity form the cognitive basis for various ""spiritualisms"". 14. The evidence that brain and mind are one is now overwhelming. Great examples in support of the aforementioned assertion. 15. Great tidbits of knowledge throughout, ""what people remember happening rarely corresponds to what actually happened"". 16. Provides four great explanations for the sensed-presence effect found in the brain. With plenty of fascinating examples. 17. The mind in its proper context. 18. In order to understand beliefs you must understand neurons. 19. Dopamine...the belief drug. A lot of interesting facts. 20. Great explanation on why dualism is intuitive and monism counterintuitive. 21. The theory of mind and agenticity. 22. Enlightening look at why belief comes quickly and naturally while skepticism is slow and unnatural. 23. The afterlife chapter is one of my favorite chapters of this book...worth the price of admission. 24. Six solid reasons why people believe there is life after death. 25. The case for the existence of the afterlife around four lines of evidence and the thorough debunking that follows. 26. Compelling explanations for Near-Death Experiences (NDEs). 27. Ditto for Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs). 28. A compelling explanation of, why do so many people believe in God? 29. Three lines of evidence that supernatural beliefs are hardwired into our brains. Great stuff. 30. The compelling evidence that humans created gods and not vice versa. 31. Great explanation on the difference between agnosticism versus atheism. 32. Mr. Shermer's last law, an interesting take. I will not spoil it here. 33. Interesting tidbits on Einstein who is always fascinating. 34. The supernatural in proper context. 35. Science as the best tool ever in devising how the world works. 36. Interesting chapter on aliens. 37. Conspiracy theories and what characteristics indicate they are likely untrue. 38. Fascinating look at the 9/11 ""conspiracy"". 39. How conspiracies actually work. 40. Mr. Shermer even delves in the world of politics. Liberals versus conservatives. 41. A realistic visions of human nature and why it would help understand one another. 42. A dozen essentials to liberty and freedom. Democracy a different perspective. 43. Interesting look at how our brains convince us that we are always right. 44. Explanation of a series of biases: confirmation bias, hindsight bias, self-justification bias, attribution bias, sunk-coast bias, status-quo bias, anchoring bias, representative bias, inattentional blindness bias, and more... 45. Why science is the ultimate bias-detection machine. 46. Awesome belief history on exploration: Columbus, Galileo, Bacon... 47. Astronomy...beliefs and historical debates. 48. Good use of previous knowledge of biases to help understand data. 49. Red shifts and other astronomical hypotheses explained, and the photograph that changed the universe. 50. The greatest unsolved mystery. 51. Links worked great! 52. An intellectual treat from cover to cover! Negatives: 1. Having to buy extra copies to share with close friends. 2. Having to wait for Mr. Shermer's next book. In summary, this may be Michael Shermer's greatest book. This book feels like a labor of love in which Mr. Shermer is able to match his accumulation of prodigious knowledge and his lucid thoughts in total harmony. This book not only met my high expectations it exceeded it, I couldn't put it down. Thought-provoking, enlightening and a joy to read. I can't recommend this book enough, kudos to Mr. Shermer for a great accomplishment. Further suggestions: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""SuperSense"" by Bruce M.

22,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4678265-kim-wombles,5,"Taken from http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.co...It took me awhile to find this photo (see the link above) in my stream of thousands of photos because it's more than a month old. I've been reading Michael Shermer's latest book The Believing Brain for over a month now to review it for here and Science 2.0. I spent more than a month with Baron-Cohen's The Science of Evil. I try to be thorough and careful in my reading of books I review; I don't want to gloss over it and throw out a review that is, well, a throw-away. This means that their work tends to stay with me and percolate in additional posts. Michael Shermer and Robert Sapolsky have much in common; I suspect that people who specialize in one area, spend their time teaching it, giving talks about it, and writing it end up having a well-honed spiel that makes the audience familiar with the person immediately in recognizable territory. I use the works of both these compelling and charismatic scholars in my classes; Shermer and Brian Dunning's work ground my composition courses and set the stage for the semester, while Sapolsky is used in my psychology classes (although I don't teach psychology much any more). Listening to them give talks is never boring, no matter how many times I've watched a particular talk with students. As an instructor, my hope is to be that thorough, that polished, and that easy a speaker.Reading Shermer's newest book was like dropping in on an old friend. I could hear his voice as I read, his inflections, and a lot of the material is familiar to long-time readers. Whether Shermer's new to a reader or an old friend, this new book is worth the investment of time; it's well written, charmingly presented, and full of passages that time and again I wanted to run to the computer and type in to share with readers. It builds on his ideas about patternicity and agenticity, updating them with the latest research that bolster his ideas.It's an excellent read and at this point, after a month of careful reading and rereading, so well dog-eared by me that each time I pick it up to continue reading it, I have to look for the latest dog-ear. This should be required reading for all college students; it really should. Understanding how we form our beliefs about the world around us and then rationalize those beliefs is important and a warning that however strongly convinced we are of something, we need to take into consideration that our belief came first and the support came afterwards. It means a certain sense of discomfort always being endured, to tread lightly, to balance carefully, and to hopefully remain open to new, contradictory evidence.What Shermer does here, and does well, is to take hundreds of scientists' work and to weave a tapestry of it, so that we have a convincing narrative (if we roll that way, anyway) that the mind and the brain are one, that without the brain the mind ceases to be, and that we are hard-wired to seek out patterns and make sense of them and to see an underlying agent for those patterns.Much of this will be familiar to those in the psychology even if for some reason they were unfamiliar with Shermer, but it might be shocking information to those who aren't versed in the research, and his section on belief in God is bound to get, oh, 70% of readers irritated as it will go against their belief systems. Ideally, readers who believe in a creator will be able to rise above their belief systems and read this section, as the ideas and the science behind them are important and ought to be considered, although I would not for a moment suggest it will cause people to set aside their belief systems. Shermer doesn't dance around his beliefs, and he's mindful of the reality that skeptics (his personal preference to the terms agnostic and atheist) are still the minority.Shermer closes his book with an epilogue entitled ""The Truth is Out There."" Shermer writes: ""When I call myself a skeptic I simply mean that I take a scientific approach to the evaluation of claims. Science is skepticism and scientists are naturally skeptical. Scientists have to be skeptical because most claims turn out to be false.""I would, based on the evidence Shermer's provided in this book, argue that scientists and scientifically-based individuals are not naturally skeptical at all, although they may be more inclined towards it. Instead, they mindfully cultivate an intentional skepticism, working hard to get around their own belief-dependent realism so that they can get as close to objective reality as possible, knowing that they must remain vigilant, and knowing that they will, at times, fail to achieve this vigilance and to maintain this skepticism, that their own blinders will lead them down stray paths and occasionally make them look like fools. It's still the best chance we have, though. And it's one I hope more and more people will choose to cultivate."

But Shermer also describes for me the true believer in the Eric Hoffer sense. He insists on science when we talk of god but embraces the teat of libertarian capitalism because it warms him, I guess. He offers no evidence for his view in this sphere, so I guess he has a belief and the dopamine hit he gets from that cold capitalist teat works for him. Not a bad book, rather ranging and filled with ego, poorly edited. A bit of filler in this pie. "

27,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5087792-melba,5,"I rated this book a five not because it was easy to read but because it was necessary to read given a world in which deep and contentious divisions exists between people based on their core beliefs. It is not the difference in beliefs that is problematic….it is the fact that we retreat into our corners and then rarely look back. Michael Shermer provides evidence for a biological basis for why and how we develop beliefs and then bury our heads in the sand when their truth is challenged. He makes the argument that evolution favored a human brain that sought to find patterns in the world around us without regard to whether they were necessarily right or wrong. He theorizes that “belief comes first, the explanations for the beliefs follow”. In other words, once we come to believe something our brain is wired to work hard to confirm that belief. He describes in detail a number of cognitive biases that we all fall prey to that “work to ensure that we are always right!”. Shermers underlying message throughout the book is that science is the answer to the question, “how can we avoid the cognitive bias pitfalls that so burden our rationality.” He labels “those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence” our champions. The last two chapters in the book (not counting the must-read Epilogue) are the Geographies of Belief and Cosmologies of Belief. They both simply fascinated me (while also containing some information that was beyond my capacity to understand.) He uses these final chapters to demonstrate “how science works in practice: not only how it requires an elegant blend of data, theory, and presentation…..but also how scientific disputes are resolved and what happens to previously accepted theories tended obsolete by new observations”. In the Epilogue, Shermer summarizes, “in the end all of us are trying to make sense of the world, and nature has gifted us with a double-edged sword that cuts for and against. On one edge, our brains are the most complex and sophisticated information-processing machines in the universe, capable of understanding not only the universe itself but also the process of understanding. On the other edge, by the very same process of forming beliefs about the universe and ourselves, we are also more capable than any other species of self-deception and illusion, of fooling ourselves even while we are trying to avoid being fooled by nature.” Only an ever present awareness of our own susceptibility for self deception and illusion will save us from them.

This ability helps us escape from predictor, predicting weather (by looking at the stars) thus improving our agriculture, etc.For example, imagine you are a creature in African savanna, the place where our ancestors once lived. You hear the grass nearby rustling. Is it caused by harmless wind or a dangerous predictor? If you think it's a dangerous predictor so you run away quickly but it turns out to be just normal wind, you made a mistake, yes, but it is harmless so you won't get hurt. However, if you think it is just a wind so you stay put but it turns out to be a hungry lion, you are out of the gene pool, thus your gene will not be passed to the next generations.Our pattern recognition like the one of rustling grass might not always be right, but it helps us not to, well, be dead. Therefore, we see this as an effective method to deal with everything in the world. We like connecting dots, making patterns, finding connections between events although it might not be correct. You can observe this all around you from dreaming about lottery numbers to superstitions.The problem we have to deal with is that believing in the pattern that is not there like superstition has been with us for millions of years while the scientific method, the best method we have to rule out false positive patterns and to challenge our beliefs, is only a few hundred of years old.I was convinced that our belief could be changed when we were challenged by evidence, data, and observations, but I'm not sure whether holding that view is necessarily correct anymore. The more one's view is challenged, the strongly one clings to the ideas, making persuading a person to change their mind on the internet unwise and useless.So what did I learn from this book? It teaches me that our brain is not at all as good as we imagine. It makes us connect dots that don't exist and be protective of our belief when we are told wrong. However, I believe that being aware of our vulnerability could help us realize that our belief won't be always right and it would be smarter for us to consciously change our views when they are challenged by evidences."

Hence, the very diverse range of religions and weird beliefs that have surfaced over the many millennia of human existence.Michael Shermer in brilliant fashion, presents evidence from a wide range of sciences to support his thesis that we belief weird things simply because we can’t help but form such beliefs, and science and it’s method is the best tool we’ve ever had to separate fact from fiction, truths from falsities.A thoroughly enjoyable read..."

31,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
32,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "

However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

36,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
37,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
38,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
39,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not.

We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

48,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
49,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
50,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
51,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
52,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

53,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
54,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
55,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
56,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
57,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
58,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
59,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

Assiduously researched and written with astonishing erudition and elegance.

61,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
62,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
63,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

66,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
67,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
68,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
69,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails..

""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes. The last part may not be interesting to many people but for curious amateurs fans of Polictics, Astronomy and especially Skeptical. I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could. Whatever the nature of your immortal and infinite spiritual essence actually is, as a mortal finite corporeal being I cannot possibly fathom it despite my best efforts, and so do with me what you will."""

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

76,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

78,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."

Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
80,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
81,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
82,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

83,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
84,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
85,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
86,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
87,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
88,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
89,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

91,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
92,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
93,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

94,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11222167-sebouh,5,"I expected to find a book about (Shermer`s skepticism) but I found much more, it is an excellent overview on BELIEF, the major points are  - The mechanism of belief formation (the human brain is a specialized belief forming machine that constantly picks up patterns in nature) - Believe comes first (without rationalization) and then confirmed often in biased ways - This belief mechanism covers all beliefs including political, religious, about ourselves and our entourage - Understanding the mechanism explains perfectly how people can believe in weird things including the most improbable conspiracy theories - Our belief system is constantly affected by different forms of BIAS or justification because this is how our brain works- SCIENCE is the only known system to have BIAS reducing or controlling mechanism (double blinding, controlled environment etc)Apart from being entertaining and well written, the book evoked two distinct emotions in me-	A feeling of relief as I understood how my mystic, conspiracy theorist and theist friends believe in what they believe, it is the natural product of their brain patternicity and agenticity seeking mechanism, brain neurotransmitters levels (mainly dopamine) and their genetics -	A feeling of despair as I understood that irrational and weird beliefs including religion are here to stay as long as the human brain exists"

96,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
97,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
98,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
99,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails.. Before starting this book, I've read a lot of reviews in which almost half of the reviewers are not okay only with the this half of the book because of its conflict with some of the People's comfortable beliefs. These Things are deserved to be analysed and understood out of respect for our human intellect. ""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes. The last part may not be interesting to many people but for curious amateurs fans of Polictics, Astronomy and especially Skeptical. I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could. Whatever the nature of your immortal and infinite spiritual essence actually is, as a mortal finite corporeal being I cannot possibly fathom it despite my best efforts, and so do with me what you will."""

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

106,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

108,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
109,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
110,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
111,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
112,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

113,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
114,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
115,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
116,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
117,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
118,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
119,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

121,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
122,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "

However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

126,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
127,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
128,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
129,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails.. Before starting this book, I've read a lot of reviews in which almost half of the reviewers are not okay only with the this half of the book because of its conflict with some of the People's comfortable beliefs. These Things are deserved to be analysed and understood out of respect for our human intellect. ""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes. The last part may not be interesting to many people but for curious amateurs fans of Polictics, Astronomy and especially Skeptical. I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could. Whatever the nature of your immortal and infinite spiritual essence actually is, as a mortal finite corporeal being I cannot possibly fathom it despite my best efforts, and so do with me what you will."""

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. As you go through the book you will begin to gain insight into your own thought processes and how the built in biases affect your conclusions."

You, me, them - we're all designed to perceive threats where there are none, see patterns in random data, and see it all designed just for our benefit. Boy, are we nuts."
136,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

138,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
139,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
140,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
141,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
142,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
144,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
145,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
146,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
147,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."

I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
149,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

Assiduously researched and written with astonishing erudition and elegance.

151,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
152,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "

However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

156,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
157,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."

The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
159,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails.. Before starting this book, I've read a lot of reviews in which almost half of the reviewers are not okay only with the this half of the book because of its conflict with some of the People's comfortable beliefs. These Things are deserved to be analysed and understood out of respect for our human intellect. ""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes. The last part may not be interesting to many people but for curious amateurs fans of Polictics, Astronomy and especially Skeptical. I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could. Whatever the nature of your immortal and infinite spiritual essence actually is, as a mortal finite corporeal being I cannot possibly fathom it despite my best efforts, and so do with me what you will."""

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

166,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

168,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
169,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
170,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
171,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
172,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

173,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
174,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs.

Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."

There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be 
SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable
 by Bruce Hood and 
The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
176,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
177,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
178,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
179,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

Assiduously researched and written with astonishing erudition and elegance. This may bore those with little patience, but can guide you to make informed decisions when confronted with choices, if interpreted properly. "
181,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
182,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
183,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

186,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
187,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
188,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
189,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails.. Before starting this book, I've read a lot of reviews in which almost half of the reviewers are not okay only with the this half of the book because of its conflict with some of the People's comfortable beliefs. These Things are deserved to be analysed and understood out of respect for our human intellect. ""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes. The last part may not be interesting to many people but for curious amateurs fans of Polictics, Astronomy and especially Skeptical. I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could. Whatever the nature of your immortal and infinite spiritual essence actually is, as a mortal finite corporeal being I cannot possibly fathom it despite my best efforts, and so do with me what you will."""

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. As you go through the book you will begin to gain insight into your own thought processes and how the built in biases affect your conclusions."

You, me, them - we're all designed to perceive threats where there are none, see patterns in random data, and see it all designed just for our benefit. Boy, are we nuts."
196,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

198,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
199,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
200,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
201,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
202,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

203,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
204,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
205,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
206,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
207,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."

I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
209,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

211,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
212,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
213,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

216,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
217,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
218,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
219,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could.

Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. As you go through the book you will begin to gain insight into your own thought processes and how the built in biases affect your conclusions."

You, me, them - we're all designed to perceive threats where there are none, see patterns in random data, and see it all designed just for our benefit. Boy, are we nuts."
226,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

228,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
229,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
230,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
231,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
232,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

233,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
234,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
235,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
236,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
237,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."

I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
239,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
242,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
243,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation.

246,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
247,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
248,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
249,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist.

You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could.

Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

256,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

258,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
259,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
260,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
261,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
262,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

263,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
264,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
265,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
266,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
267,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
268,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
269,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."

Assiduously researched and written with astonishing erudition and elegance. This may bore those with little patience, but can guide you to make informed decisions when confronted with choices, if interpreted properly. "
271,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I was probably the most excited about this book before cracking it's cover... The premise is alluring and it is very timely (it seems that we are having a media renaissance in the recognition of human limitations of rationality) yet, once opened, the book just falls into too many traps to be exciting to me.Perhaps the largest flaw for me was that the work is 'too current' - insofar as much of the book seems to be just a parroting of factoids that have been floating around in many other places recently. Much of the material seemed directly lifted from a variety of other popular non-fiction books/shows(The Psychopath Test, Predictably Irrational, The God Delusion, Radio Lab, etc.). Unfortunately, Shermer's narration was much less captivating for me than the originals that seemed to inspire it and his focus was often on the most mainstream and banal of topics. For example, Shermer spends a huge chunk of the beginning of his book attempting to dispel his conception of the Christian god. Obviously god(s) were going to be featured in a book about belief and I fully expected this. But I think everyone would have been able to appreciate Shermer's points in more depth if he had tried to reach a little further afield for his material - if you are reading this book (or even this review) chances are good that you already have strong opinions on your understanding of religious matters. I'm sure most Christians reading this book would be turned off by his offhanded dismissal of their faith, whereas those already converted to Shermer's atheist mindset are likely to be bored. There is almost a glut of recent books attempting to dismantle Christian beliefs, but many of them do so in more entertaining ways. If Shermer had explored less familiar material to illustrate his points (e.g. ancient religions, or perhaps cargo cults), the discussion would have been less personal and allowed the reader to get the distance/novelty needed to really engage in the ideas. Perhaps the second oddity of the book was Shermer's insistence on 'disproving' some of the beliefs that he covers. I was hoping for a careful examination and discussion of what makes the mind prone to belief in general (it is, afterall, right there in the subtitle). Instead, after Shermer has ""shown"" religious people that they are wrong, we have another mind-numbingly long checklist on why 9/11 Truthers are wrong. Again, chances are good if you are reading this book (or reading at all, really), you don't believe that Cheney and Bush blew up the WTC using holograms, no matter how annoying/evil you might have found that administration. So, pages and pages later, it is confusing as to whom exactly Shermer believes his audience is, and why he needs to lecture us so much about why the Truthers are incorrect.The good news is that if you make it this far in the book (and then slog through one of the most frustrating chapters of the book - the chapter on politics), things do get a little better. Around chapter 12(!!), the book settles down a little and moves into discussing the generalities of belief that should have been in Chapter 1. As Shermer moves past his sections on his personal pet peeves of belief, he calms down a little and starts sounding a lot less preachy and a lot more likable. Which leaves you with a more favorable ending impression, just not enough to make this particular reader Believe he wants to read any more of Shermer's works."
272,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"U.S. President Lyndon Johnson once formed an alliance with a erstwhile political enemy. When someone asked him why, Johnson remarked that he would rather have the enemy inside the tent urinating out than outside the tent urinating in. So it is with Shermer. His thesis, that the human brain through the process of natural selection has evolved to see patterns, even when none exists, gives him a platform from which he may assault the many, many popular beliefs with which he disagrees. It is enjoyable to see him attack 9/11 truthers and similar boneheads with an unabridged dictionary, apparently unburdened by the idea that doing so may be a futile exercise. It was less enjoyable to see him attack belief in God. I consider (rightfully or not) my life to be difficult and when I reward myself and sit down with a book at the end of a day, it is usually not with the aim of seeing cherished beliefs, which have been arrived at after much thought, get paddled with, to my mind, unseemly enthusiasm and loaded vocabulary designed to provoke, despite author's protestations to the contrary.More importantly, though, I also thought he was missing another point, specifically, that while belief in God has undoubtedly led to much senseless cruelty and suffering, it has also inspired people to behave selflessly and compassionately. Compare this to, say, 9/11 truthers, whose theories, as far as I can tell, have inspired a lot of ugly name-calling, baseless suspicion, paranoia, and threats but, to the best of my knowledge, have not motivated anyone to behave with greater charity to their neighbor. Even if you believe in neither God or 9/11 conspiracy theories, it is an unfortunate rhetoric choice to lump them together as irrationally held views. I imagine that Shermer might say that he is uninterested in the utility of false views, and that he is only interested in whether they are true or false. He often stops in his tracks during the book to remind us, in case we've forgotten, how dedicated to truth and other admirable things (e.g., p. 48: “I am a radical for liberty”) he is, implying in my mind that people who disagree with him are insufficiently concerned with such things. In spite of these professions, I found that the book was concerned more with score-settling than truth-telling, and could have used a good editor to strike out every occurrence of the words “I”, “me”, “my”, and “mine”, plus surrounding anecdote, after which the author could try to write a book with more humor and self-deprecation, and less chest-thumping and self-promotion. As the book stands now, the author's voice is so off-putting that it worked to discredit his ideas. I apologize to my good friend Joel, who sent me a gift certificate while recommending this book, for this cranky review, and urge him to keep sending me book recommendations. "
273,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"If you have read Shermer's book or topics such as: scientific skepticism, cosmology, neuroscience, cognitive biases... a large part of this one certainly feels familiar. However, compared to other books of the same author, The Believing Brain is much better at coding ideas into smoothy proses. (I sucked up every words in certain parts) One big, central concept Shermer presents here is of ""Believe dependant realism"": we believe and then reason follows. Shermer's term has a clear connection to ""Model-dependent realism"" which was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design. This concept along with cognitive bias, limitations in sensory organs and perceptions explain pretty much many domains in the science of believe. A beautifully written foreword, a brief philosophical discussion about politics, conspiracy theories in the middle, a concise summary of multiverse near the end are what i like most.Here Shermer's word for his wife (like Carl Sagan's for his, i want these words for future mine):""To Devin Ziel Shermer For our small contribution — 6,895 days or 18.9 years from birth to independence — to the metaphorically miraculous 3. 5 -billion-year continuity of life on Earth from one generation to the next, unbroken over the eons, glorious in its contiguity, spiritual in its contemplation. The mantle is now yours."""
274,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11222167-sebouh,5,"I expected to find a book about (Shermer`s skepticism) but I found much more, it is an excellent overview on BELIEF, the major points are  - The mechanism of belief formation (the human brain is a specialized belief forming machine that constantly picks up patterns in nature) - Believe comes first (without rationalization) and then confirmed often in biased ways - This belief mechanism covers all beliefs including political, religious, about ourselves and our entourage - Understanding the mechanism explains perfectly how people can believe in weird things including the most improbable conspiracy theories - Our belief system is constantly affected by different forms of BIAS or justification because this is how our brain works- SCIENCE is the only known system to have BIAS reducing or controlling mechanism (double blinding, controlled environment etc)Apart from being entertaining and well written, the book evoked two distinct emotions in me-	A feeling of relief as I understood how my mystic, conspiracy theorist and theist friends believe in what they believe, it is the natural product of their brain patternicity and agenticity seeking mechanism, brain neurotransmitters levels (mainly dopamine) and their genetics -	A feeling of despair as I understood that irrational and weird beliefs including religion are here to stay as long as the human brain exists"

276,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Michael Shermer is a prolific writer, best known for The Science of Good & Evil, Why People Believe Weird Things, and, publisher of Skeptic Magazine. I have been a huge fan of Shermer for some years and traveled cross-country twice this year to attend his conferences on the west coast.The early chapters of The Believing Brain have some redundancy from Shermer's earlier work but the last 60 percent is a wealth of new information that I found enlightening, and partially disturbing. Unlike the vast majority of the academic and atheist community, Shermer is politically conservative. His explanation of why people divide out between liberal and conservative I found to be profound. Liberals and conservatives have different sets of moral values. Liberals value freedom, justice and fairness. Conservatives place high values on societal cohesiveness, authority and security. H. L. Mencken famously said that ""For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong."" In this case I tend to think Sermer is probably right. This book is definitely a must read. "
277,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45275506,3,"Shermer starts his book straight away from the very important statement: beliefs appear first and only then their explanations and rationales. Well, of course beliefs pop up not from nowhere. They may come from personal experience, from surrounding, from culture and society. But as soon as they are established a human brain works filtering all incoming information in order to constantly support existing beliefs. It either rejects everything which dares to challenge existing beliefs or finds ways to transform such uncomfortable information to make it look as if it actually confirms these beliefs. Basically what we usually blame politicians to do, every of us does unintentionally whichever beliefs we have.‘The believing brain’ looks like a book which picks up everything related to the topic (unfortunately unrelated too, but about this later). For me the most interesting were parts farthest from any philosophical discussions, purely scientific. How actually our brain works. In other books devoted to the human mind I had read already about specific feature of our brain: we think associatively, not logically. Logic is what we deliberately learn and develop during our life, ‘by nature’ this tool is quite weak. But making associations is what saved us in the wild nature and what in the contemporary world makes us call the brightest of us ‘creative’. At the same time we tend to create excessive, wrong associations since the life in the wild nature proved that it’s better to make a wrong association than not to make a correct association which can eventually cost our life. Our brain doesn’t calculate probabilities efficiently enough so it prefers just to create an association as if probability was confirming it. For people who create patterns from everything in their lives (so mostly wrong patterns) we have a name ‘schizophrenics’. Anyone can watch how it looks in the terrific movie ‘A beautiful mind’.Then, as soon as an association (or a pattern as Shermer writes) is created a brain tends to endow it with a sense, with an intention, with an agent action. This comes from our ‘consciousness theory’: out ability to understand motives of a counterpart, to imagine what he/she wants and how he/she is going to achieve his/her goals. This feature has been tremendously developed during millions years of our life as a social species. But here again as with any other specific feature there is a flip side of the coin. It’s perhaps OK to see intentions behind any action in a society but our brain ‘puts’ intentions to everything what happens with us. This way various spirits, demons and gods were invented. And the same is applicable for conspiracy theories since the ground for them is a strong belief that everything in the life is interconnected (~patterns) and all events happen following some predefined logic (~agents).There is also one very interesting chapter in the book which is devoted to the tricks our brain performs in order to convince us. There is quite a long range of biases which we posses. The main of them is a bias of confirmation which ‘helps’ us seek and find confirmations supporting some of our existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret the facts which contradict them. Another bias is a retrospective bias which is a tendency to reconstruct a past accordingly to a present knowledge. It’s like when football funs know the best how their team should have played after a game is over. This bias serves too as an additional ground for conspiracy theories: a government had known something before some tragic events happened and hadn’t reacted, why? Yet another bias is a bias of self-justification which helps us logically ground our decisions in the past in order to convince ourselves in the correctness of our deeds. And there are many other, I will not enumerate all of them here.What I didn’t like about this book is a number of chapters which didn’t have much to do with the main topic of the book. There were some long stories of people who either came to the trust in god or on the opposite came to the skepticism regarding existence or necessity of god. They were just boring. Then the book shares the same problem with books by Richard Dawkins: sort of dispute with supporters of creationism. The author argues that a god which allows all atrocities which we are well aware of is a bad god. So the author doesn’t notice that he starts playing on a playground of those whom he is arguing with. Is a goal of the book to show how our brain create gods or to discuss if the Christian God is good or bad god? Talking about different people’s beliefs Shermer uses extremely many pages describing his own experience of encounters with various mediums, psychics, ufologists and others of such kind. Then there were two long stories from the history of astrophysics: one about discovery of the rings of Saturn and another about far galaxies discovery. They were in a way stories about how even in a science it’s difficult to be impersonal and be able to reject old dogmas. But they were too long and technically detailed. Maybe in a book about astrophysics I could find these stories exciting. But it’s annoying when you find such long unrelated passages in a book on completely different topic. So everything really relevant could have been compressed in a book twice or even triple shorter than this one.I would recommend reading this book anyway. But be prepared to skip entire chapters."
278,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19203705-fon-sawitree,3,"3.5, because the book explained well about human's tendency to be biased via evolutional brain and deficits or stress can give you hallucination. The evidences about each topics are supportive. However, I am taken aback by the way he claimed that ""There is no such thing as mind."" As a neuroscientist myself, and as a scientist that Shermer claimed he is, we cannot conclude anything non-existent without proof or anything to deny the null hypothesis like that. He said himself that if there is no proof for X, that doesn't mean that Y exists (or in the other way, that doesn't mean that X does not exist.) Many doctors and neuroscientists have already shown that will power can manipulate the neuron firing, and neuronal pathway (neuroplasticity.) If there is no such thing as mind as he claimed, he did not explain this fact clearly at all. He went overboard that the freewill is just simply the result from neuron firings, really? As a scientist, you also need to be opened to the possibility that it can exist, and that ""mind"" defines individualism. He avoided discussing psychiatric states (depression, Schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, etc.) Genetics play only 15% on our mind (though Shermer claimed 40% on twin study about political and religious beliefs, other twin studies showed only 15%, but of course, more % in appearance, heights, hair color, no brainer here.) Shermer is a psychologist, not a neuroscientist, so he tends to explain things in narrative way that is easy to relate and understand with description and definition. However, he did not execute well in the neuroscience, physiological, and biological ways at all. He could not explain well why our brain makes us believe in molecular/cellular/morphological/physiological detail. He explained just the part of the brain that is responsible for this and that, he failed to realized that his psychological background actually makes things less believable by using a lot of wording, not a lot of ""science."" If he wants to claimed he is a scientist, then give me real scientific explanation, not just the scratch of facts about psychological ""definition"" and brain localization that most scientists already know. Also, the brain is really complicated and localization cannot explain why we do/think as we do. For mind and brain topic, it is similar to chicken and egg topic. Yes, it is true that the brain can create thoughts, feelings, etc. - or as we call it, mind, and when the brain is dead, thoughts, etc. cannot be created or perceived by others. However, that doesn't mean that the mind doesn't exist there. Also, the book is focused on Western ways of believe in Christianity, Bible, God, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions from Westerners' perspective. So, Shermer had no idea that other Eastern religions do not believe in the similar way of Westerners. For example, he got it completely wrong about the virgin birth of Buddha. Buddha is believed to born normal human, with fertilization from his father and mother. Buddha is not ""God"". He is a Teacher. He discovered Buddhism via natural law of science and nature. Yes, there are supernatural things taught in Buddhism as well, but that probably came from either 1. human in the past created imaginary stories to make them more believable or 2. they really happened - we never know. I agree on some temporal and parietal lobes' facts that make you believe in supernatural things, (he forgot to go into detail about limbic lobe (emotional brain) and amygdala (fear and negative feelings area - which would have supported his book with better facts on why people believe.)); but if you study Buddhism or other religions based on Buddhism, you see the teaching is about the truth of nature: state of ""being"" & sadness we experience every day due to ""wanting"", ""not wanting"", etc, way of state of being sadness, how to get rid of sadness, and nirvana - which is the state of not feeling anything (please google here for better explanation), and how Buddhism teaches us to realize that everything is born/created/built, and then everything will be destroyed/die/disappear, etc. and karma. Anyway, it is hard to explain in detail - leave it for another topic, but it is similar to what one of the doctors explained about Jeff Probts (sp?) and his existence is just one of the wave of life/loop of nature that Shermer mentioned - yes, it doesn't make sense to him and his Western upbringing. However, as a Buddhist, I understand exactly what that doc meant. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to validate that Buddhism is the only ""fact"", I am just trying to point out how naive he is about ""religion."" I grew up learning the teaching of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc. mandatorily, in school curriculum, and made my own choice to believe in Buddhism (also, my parents are Buddhism, so bias right there, I admit.) As opposed to Shermer, and mist d the Westerner, that are limited to one upbringing as atheism or in Sunday school, or Synagogue, etc. I respect Shermer's effort to explain our tendency to believe and our evolutionary bias. I am a scientist and neuroscientist myself that I only believe in proof, study, research, and extensive explanation without bs; but I am also an open-minded person that believes there may be things unseen out there and will not make a conclusion about ""there is no such thing as ghost/supernatural/ET/miracle/psychic/mind etc. until proven otherwise. Shermer failed to do research about other cases about a lot of things. I know one story about a child, born in one family, family A, natural born from two parents via fertilization) in year X, turned out she said she was a soldier reborn from last life (year X-40) from another family, family B, years ago and could tell exactly who her (his, if we talk about his last life) former real parents were. She could explain her/his last life in detail that a young girl should not have known about the war 40 years ago. She could tell exactly the address of the B parents, their deceased dog, and every trivia things she could not know in her age, while she was with her ""new"" family, A, in different city miles away. So, yes, weird things do happen, and Shermer failed to open his mind that may be weird things can be ""supernatural"" and ""real"". They cannot be explained by science and that doesn't mean you should discredit those things."
279,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239135-kaitlynn,3,"This is a book that would have benefited from just slightly tighter editing. The book opens really strong, and it ends pretty strong. In the middle Shermer goes on tangents that detract from the tone, voice, and focus of the book. For example, he does a step-by-step walkthrough breaking down 9/11 conspiracies. It wasn't bad. But it felt deeply out of place - we're looking at why people believe it, not debunking one of a million conspiracy theories (especially one that had gotten so much debunking attention as this). There's also a libertarian screed thrown in there after bitching about how most scientists are democrats. It really comes off as he's the only smart one in the room, he's the one that's got it all figured out, you guys. Libertarian talking points are just sort of thrown in there and not backed up. For example, he carefully, subtlety implies that welfare programs are just helping the lazy mooch and are otherwise worthless. (Which is not borne out in data at all, but since liberals have apparently biased science, it makes it difficult to provide acceptable evidence to the contrary - see what he does there?) When he swerves back to the good stuff and talks about biases towards the end, it almost feels like a professor that got distracted in class and is rushing through those final few slides. Some biases he just labels, defines, and moves on, when I really wanted to get into the meat of them. "

Rating this book as high has nothing to do with my bias as I don't possess any burden of proof (May get to know when you get to read it). It's a good work of several decades of research (his own and others) by the author. The first part deals with examples of two real life characters tending to believe in their unique convictions and their possible causes of beliefs, one of whom is a real famous scientist. The part also includes the author's own journey of becoming a Skeptic Nontheist from a Ardent Ecclesiastic believer. Second Part covers the psychological cognitive processes involved in our brains that ultimately makes us believing in stuffs. The phenomena and various tendencies and the author's rationalisation is more than convincing.Third part deals with People believing in stuffs like God, Afterlife, Aliens and Conspiracy theories like Fake Landings on Moon, 9/11, Chemtrails..

""Knowledge brings Stability, Ignorance brings Chaos.""The last part of the book deals with the geopolitical and cosmological dogmas and delusions we previously had because of our various biases and stereotypes.

I would recommend this work for everyone who have courage to face the hard truth than comforting beliefs in critical issues.  This is one of my favourites,""In any case, if there is an afterlife and a God who resides over it, I intend to make my case along these lines:Lord, I did the best I could with the tools you granted me. You gave me a brain to thinkskeptically and I used it accordingly. You gave me the capacity to reason and I applied it to allclaims, including that of your existence. You gave me a moral sense and I felt the pangs of guilt and the joys of pride for the bad and good things I chose to do. I tried to do unto others as I would have them do unto me, and although I fell far short of this ideal far too many times, I tried to apply your foundational principle whenever I could.

Overall the book was a tad too meandering and repetitive, and read at times as a blog entry rant as opposed to one that is more grounded in critical analysis. Nonetheless still offers a good scan of the ways of nonscientific thinking - that too many people form a belief first and find the confirming evidence thereafter - especially relevant in this age of (mostly American) climate change denial, creationist belief and anti-Vaxxers.

Feynman""The Believing Brain"" is an excellent explanation of Richard Feynman's quote. Using cutting edge neuroscience and evolutionary psychology Shermer goes through each of the survival mechanisms that have been built into our brains by evolution to show how we construct beliefs and reinforce them. This belief machine in our heads will skew anything: politics, science, or even what sports team to root for in very predictable ways and Shermer shows how this is done. Chapter by chapter he outlines the current understand of how the brain forms beliefs supporting his claims with the latest finding of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

286,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"I first heard Shermer on a video podcast from TED. The ideas intrigued me. In the lecture, and in this book, he investigates our tendency to embrace new ideas only if they confirm what we already believe while rejecting ideas that contradict or threaten our current belief. Citing research in neuroscience that suggests that our brains are wired to seek patterns and relationships, Shermer postulates that as a species, we were more likely to succeed in the game of life by perceiving patterns even if we were sometimes wrong (a false positive) than to be skeptical, refusing to ""jump to conclusions"" about a possible pattern. He sets up a hypothetical situation which nicely illustrate the point:  ""Imagine that you are a hominid walking along the savanna of and African valley three million years ago. You hear a rustle in the grass. Is it just the wind or is it a dangerous predator? Your answer could mean life or death. ""If you assume that the rustle is the grass is a dangerous predator but it turns out that it is just the wind, you have made what is called a Type 1 error in cognition, also knows as a false positive, or believing something is real when it is not. That is, you have found a nonexistent pattern. You connected (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, but in this case A was not connected to B. No harm. You move away from the rustling sound, become more alert and cautious, and find another path to your destination. ""If you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind [don't create a pattern] but it turns out that it is a dangerous predator, you have made what is called a Type II error in cognition, also known as a false negative, or believing something is not real when it is. That is, you have missed a real pattern. You failed to connect (A) a rustle in the grass to (B) a dangerous predator, and in this case A was connected to B. You're lunch. Congratulations, you have won a Darwin Award. You are no longer a member of the hominid gene pool. ""Our brains are belief engines, evolved pattern-recognition machines that connect the dots and create meaning out of the patterns that we think we see in nature. . . . We are the descendants of those who were most successful at finding patterns. I call this process patternicity, the process of seeking and finding patterns, connecting the dots, linking A to B."" (59)On the issue of how rational people justify irrationally-held beliefs, Shermer states:""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for nonsmart reasons. Most people, most of the time, arrive at their beliefs for a host of reasons involving personality and temperament, family dynamics and cultural background, parents and siblings, peer groups and teachers, education and books, mentors and heroes, and various life experiences, very few of which have anything to do with intelligence. The Enlightenment ideal of Homo rationalis has us sitting down before a table of facts, weighing them in the balance pro and con, and then employing logic and reason to determine which set of facts best supports this or that theory. This is not at all how we form beliefs. What happens is that the facts of the world are filtered by our brains through the colored lenses of worldviews, paradigms, theories, hypotheses, conjectures, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through living. We then sort through the facts and select those that confirm what we already believe and ignore or rationalize away those that contradict our beliefs."" (36)""How is it that people come to believe something that seemingly defies reason? The answer is in the thesis of the book: beliefs come first; reasons for belief follow."" (133)The most interesting passage of the book prompts us to think about the societal and cultural implications of this phenomenon:[After citing research, he concludes] ""belief comes quickly and naturally, skepticism is slow and unnatural, and most people have a low tolerance for ambiguity. The scientific principle that a claim is untrue unless proven otherwise runs counter to our natural tendency to accept as true that which we can comprehend quickly. Thus it is that we should reward skepticism and disbelief, and champion those willing to change their mind in the teeth of new evidence. Instead, most social institutions--most notably those in religion, politics, and economics--reward belief n the doctrines of the faith or party or ideology, punish those who challenge the authority of the leaders, and discourage uncertainty and especially skepticism."" (135)Offering a critique of the book itself, I'd say the concepts could've been concisely taught and explained--complete with examples--in a medium-length magazine article. The book didn't contain a book's worth of rich information. The TED video probably did the job better than the book. Still, fascinating research and a compelling thesis."

288,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,3,"I started reading Michael Shermer's work about 15 years ago, when he released Why People Believe Weird Things and I've been enjoying his work ever since. I regularly recommend both Weird Things and The Science of Good and Evil to people. I subscribe to the magazine he publishes, Skeptic Magazine, and try to stay on top of skeptic blogs and books, in general. For the most part, this book represents plenty of what I like about Shermer's writing. He offers both technical and layman's explanations of his subject matter and his writing is engaging and thoughtful.I do, though, have to take aim at his approach to politics, in this book. I will start by saying that I come down pretty firmly on the side of liberalism and Shermer identifies most closely with libertarianism. I'm going to do my best not to let my personal bias cloud my commentary, but I have to acknowledge that I feel strongly about my views and they are in conflict with Shermer's own views. So take my critique with a grain of salt.Firstly, this is a book about belief and in the context of belief, it may make sense to talk about politics, so it's understandable that Shermer devotes part of his intro and a chapter to it, but from the start of the book, Shermer comes across as defensive. He describes his own views, why he feels somewhat misunderstood and how he feels there is more nuance than a broad label like ""libertarian"" can really give. After reading the opening, I honestly felt like, while I disagreed with many of Shermer's views, I could understand that he simply puts different values before the values that are important to me. However, once he began discussing political views as part of a greater social construct and personality, it veered way out of skepticism and into self serving promotion of his own belief. Where we can look at why a person may believe he had a near death experience or alien abduction and break down the chemical and biological mechanisms that mislead the brain into believing these experiences happened, Shermer offers personal opinion as proof that his personal political beliefs are the most right of all, without offering anything more than statements on his own preference and values. I feel he does his book a real disservice here. Some of his arguments are downright unskeptical too. His claim that universities have a ""liberal bias"" because more people at universities identify as liberal, stands out as a good example. It is possible that universities do have a liberal bias that sway their students. It's also possible that an education tends to drive people to liberalism. Both of those assumptions should be considered instead of choosing the one that conforms with one's own personal belief. This is the same sort of thinking that creationists use. ""Oh, there's just a bias as universities for evolution, but our view has equal validity."" He also makes some argument to the effect that democracy in the US was an untested theory when it was established, and it worked out well, and libertarianism should get an opportunity to be tried so we can test it before dismissing it. This is nonsense on two levels. Firstly, aspects of democracy date back to sixth century BC so this was not an untested theory. Secondly, one needs a better argument than ""well, let's try this out and see if it works"" before overhauling an entire government system. I would like to believe that even if Shermer shared my political beliefs, I'd still identify some of these problems with his arguments, though I suspect I wouldn't have thought much of it either way, so as I said, I acknowledge my personal bias in this review. For the most part, this is a solid book, I just feel his approach to politics veered off into personal editorializing and away from the more rigorous scientific approach he's normally known for."
289,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside,3,"Based on the title, I was expecting a lot more, you know, brain science. Instead I got a good overview of logical fallacies, some interesting anecdotes about people who believed in various interesting things, coverage of popular conspiracy theories, and a very out-of-place political diatribe.I've read better books by Michael Shermer. In fact, I liked all his books better than this one. That's not to say this is a poorly written book. It was simply not what I was expecting. I was hoping to learn more about studies on brain function and on belief. There was a little bit of that, but not nearly enough. I was hoping to find out why, chemically, evolutionarily, memetically, we are a species for whom illogical beliefs are so important. I was hoping to understand the scientific underpinnings of belief better. Instead, it was mostly a rehash of the information contained in Why People Believe Weird Things -- coherent, readable, even enjoyable, but didn't do what it said on the tin. In fact, Why People Believe Weird Things actually got much more to the why point than this one did.Before I close this review, let me emphasize how weirdly inconsistent with the rest of the text was the loving essay on the superiority of Libertarianism. Why is it that every single Libertarian I have ever met or even just heard of cannot resist harping on how obviously, morally, logically excellent a viewpoint is Libertarianism? It's not even like I disagree. If some crazed madman in an Uncle Sam costume were to put a gun to my head and force me to instantly identify myself in political terms (a practice I avoid in reality, for that way lies madness), I would name myself Libertarian. But I never call myself one in practice because I'm afraid people will assume I'm like all the rest of them -- literally, all the rest of them, including, apparently, Shermer: Proselytizing at the smallest opportunity. I'm also afraid people will assume I like or even appreciate Ayn Rand. (Let the record show that I neither like nor appreciate her. She was a bloviating madwoman and John Galt can take his eighty-six-page dullard of a monologue and stick it where the sun don't shine.) For those reasons I will never pin the label of Libertarian on my chest, but still, I happen to agree with Shermer that it's a sounder and more rational political stance than any other popular option. But regardless: What does a chapter on the superiority of Libertarianism have to do with brain science? Nothing, as far as I could tell by reading this book. And I am still not going to vote for Ron Paul. Suck it."
290,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,4,"The Believing Brain is a fantastic walk through the nature of belief. Shermer's thesis is simple enough: belief comes first and the justification of that belief follows afterword. The cognitive heuristics we humans use to reinforce our sundry notions prove fascinating, but may be problematic if we justify false belief. I used to tell my seventh graders, ""It's important to have opinions, but it's more important to know why you have those opinions."" That is a mantra I will continue promulgating and I will stand behind it. I echo Shermer's zeal for introducing a healthy amount of skepticism into our discourse. In the year of Chic-fil-A protests, we have campaigning politicians lambasting one another with unsubstantiated claims, multiple gun massacres, and ever-increasing intolerance for the ""other,"" be it a different political party, religious group, or lifestyle. It is time for all of us to step back, dial down the rhetoric, and honestly self-evaluate our positions. Do we have fallacious cognitive biases that should be resolved? My guess: yes. We all do. This book cites numerous fascinating scientific, psychological, and sociological studies with topics ranging from political biases to UFO sightings. For instance: a study of how people who consider themselves Republicans or Democrats can look at contradictory statements from both parties, but only recognize it in the other party--not to mention the fact that brain scans show this as an emotional decision not a rational one, and then show a subsequent neural-chemical hit we get in our brain's pleasure center that further solidifies our erroneous notions. Shermer also provides a nearly encyclopedic content of biases that we use when forming our beliefs. His anecdotes liven the content and illuminate the ideas, while his research speaks to the credibility of his theories.That being said, the author gets tangental from time to time, most notably in his chapter on economics. He's a libertarian and proud of it to the point where he can help but reveal his own biases to an annoying, not to mention condescending, degree. His chapters chronicling the history of astronomy are tedious as well. He got his PhD in science history and flexes his abilities a little too far in my opinion. But this is perhaps a revealing and important flaw in the book. No one--not even a guy who studies belief for a living--can escape their own personal biases. That's why I say it's so important to know why we have the beliefs we have. It's as important as the beliefs themselves, and even more telling about who we really are. We cannot escape our biases, but we can work to frame our understanding of them in a rational manner. "
291,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256437-joseph,5,"Great book! Will doubtlessly be a classic within the skeptical canon. This book covers a lot of ground so I'll just restate the thesis and point out a couple of my favorite moments. Shermer aruges that belief comes first and evidence for those beliefs comes second. As much as we should strive to, we don't weigh evidence and then come to a rational decision. First we find patterns, real or imagined, which Shermer calls patternicity. Then we ascribe meaning to those patterns which reinforce our beliefs, a process Shermer calls agenticity.Also worth noting, is the author's friendly tone. He never talks down to the reader. He often cites those who disagree with him and rather than demolish their viewpoint, he let's the reader know there is debate. Of course, the book does talk about god and gods, but not in an irreverent fiery manner (ie Hitchens)and it isn't the focus of the book.  Couple of things I really liked. Shermer actually brings it to the level of neurons in the brain to explain why people may have particular traits. For instance, creativity is the result of a high level of dopamine that is given as a reward for finding patterns. These patterns can be useful, such as in songwriting or finding a model for the shape of DNA, but they can also be harmful such as in the case of schizophrenia or conspiracy theory. There is a fair amount of interesting discourse regarding aliens(Shermer calls them gods for atheists.) Shermer discusses what evidence would be required for a scientifically verifiable god. If there is a god could it be a being who has mastery of the physics of the universe? For example, we know that technology advances at a predictable rate. It doubles every 12 to 18 months. Assuming an alien society is subject to the same level of advancement, imagine if they had a thousand or even a million years on us. Their technology would have conquered areas we are starting to scratch the surface at, such as mastery of biological systems at the molecular level. But it could be expanded to manipulation of the physical environment starting small and expanding to the point of having control of planets and suns. We know that galaxies come from black holes. If manipulation at that level could be contained, we would have a good candidate for a god requiring no faith, but provable via evidence. This book provides excellent insight into why people believe what they believe and why it isn't necessarily a matter of intelligence(we learn that smart people are more likely to have unreasonable beliefs because they are able to come up with better rationalizations), but instead brain circuitry.  "
292,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"This was a disappointment. There is some good content, but that is mostly unoriginal and can be found in better books about cognitive biases, reality-testing, etc. Shermer does admit that he has biases, and I give him credit for that. And he concludes the book by saying we need to do a better job not just teaching science facts but also teaching the scientific process. I agree with that, but the scientific method is explained only at the end of the book. This is a shame, because it would be good to explain what the rational standard for ""truth"" is before bashing people for what they believe. As he points out, not many people understand the scientific method, and it is not used in the news media much. So most of the people who agree with him, as well as most people who disagree with him on whatever issue, presumably hold their beliefs for the ""wrong"" reasons. For example, with 9/11, how many people have studied the engineering reports that debunk the conspiracy theorists? Shermer questions why the conspiracy theorists believe X, but he doesn't question why the majority believes Y. Yet, it he were being scientifically rigorous and unbiased about trying to understand why people believe what they believe, then that would be the critical question. [Before I get silly comments, I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists are right!] Being objective is incredibly difficult. As he recounts, even Galileo was stubbornly wrong on some issues. So it's not possible for every citizen to fact-check everything. But it's reasonable to ask a self-styled skeptic writing a book about biased beliefs to try to be unbiased on the topics he's discussing. The most troublesome aspect of Shermer's failure to be unbiased is when he is talking about politics. The author argues for reality over ideology, but doesn't do much reality-testing on political issues and makes absurd libertarian pronouncements (market capitalism has never failed!). It would have been nice, instead of blah blah about conservatives and liberals, to look at nations or states or school districts that function well on objective measures and then illustrate with real examples how evidence-based policy-making works better than ideology.

293,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Even though this book is about beliefs, it has a huge whopping load of science, especially neurology and psychology. It doesn't address specific beliefs so much as describe how people form conjectures about the world. It talks about pattern recognition, and confirmation biases, and the common fallacies that lead people to believe things, whether it's believing that clouds generally bring rain or believing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush administration.I got the audiobook, which Shermer reads himself. He doesn't have a trained voice, and there are odd pauses that occasionally distract from the reading, but not enough for me to advise people to avoid this version. I would avoid it for difficult driving, however, because when Shermer was discussing why humans have a dualist view of themselves rather than a moniacal view of themselves (not sure if those are the right words) some one who thought he was above turn signals tried to come into my lane and I had to stop listening, and I never got a chance to go back and repeat that section. It's not a terrible commute book though, because most of the subject matter isn't heavy. For the most part, this book was a refreshing mix of facts I had heard and didn't mind a refresher on, and facts which were either new, or presented in a new enough way that they felt new.Shermer's an atheist, but he is a former Christian who has a lot of sympathy for believers. He has more sympathy than you would expect, given the subject matter. He includes himself in the subset of flawed humans who believe despite evidence to the contrary, though he doesn't admit to any of these beliefs himself.I might have given it four stars, except that the last 40 minutes or so was very astronomy-heavy. Only one sentence seemed to tie the history of astronomical discoveries into the main theme of the book, and I found it a tenuous tie at best. Maybe for other people, this isn't a drawback, but astronomy bores me, which is why I generally seek out books on subjects like neurology and psychology and even occasionally philosophy. Why discuss the distance of nebulas and ponder the existence of multiverses and talk about galaxy rotational speeds and spectronomy? What does this have to do with the believing brain? It felt like sushi at a pizzeria: sure, everyone else in the world seems to like sushi, but I came here for the cheese and garlic. For me the astronomy section meant a very boring half hour in an otherwise entertaining book."
294,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,3,"The Believing BrainWe assume that belief follows reason, but it's actually the other way around - reason follows our beliefs. Two biases dominate our perception of the world:1) self confirmation bias - we only see the evidence that confirms our existing belief2) the ""agent"" bias - our minds are designed to look for the agent that caused a given resultOur belief in religion (""god"" is the ultimate ""agent"") in conspiracies (911 truth, JFK, Roswell) and arguably economics is based on our belief in agents. Even Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is a wonderful example of an ""agent"".Next is the self confirmation bias. Once we believe something, we seek evidence that confirms those beliefs.Keys to success.1. Learn to help others believe2. Learn to create myth3. Never ""believe"" anythingThat said, as author of many books and someone seeking media attention, Shemer isn't that different from Rush Limbaugh - he's got his line and his followers, and his business rests on maintaining leadership over his little faction. Much of this book is about preaching to the choir, and if your not already in that choir, some of the passages will be repetitive and annoying.This critique I've reposted (partially) because I think it makes some relevant points:The actual neuroscience in the book could be summarized in about five pages.The rest of the book is more information about the author's personal beliefs, pet peeves, etc. Interestingly, when discussing theories he is critical of, the author holds studies to a very high standard, but when discussing his own theory, he references studies and concepts that often do not reach the same level of rigor. In fact, some of his discussions about certain regions of the brain being responsible for highly complex thought patterns is the exact type of modern phrenology that makes most modern neuroscientists cringe. I actually agree with the author's general premise about beliefs. I am equally skeptical of the existence of god, likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life, and the various pop conspiracy theories that are out there. I just think the book could have been written in 50 pages. Or better yet, it could have been shortened to a magazine article and not lost any of its basic premise."
295,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/322183-steve,2,"It's more like The Michael Shermer Manifesto than it is a defense and explanation of a specific thesis. There is an explicit thesis that he reiterates from time to time--""We form our beliefs for a variety of subjective, personal, emotional and psychological reasons in the context of environments created by family, friends, colleagues, culture, and society at large; after forming our beliefs we then defend, justify, and rationalize them with a host of intellectual reasons, cogent arguments, and rational explanations."" However, there are a number of tangents that don't serve very specifically to demonstrate that thesis but tend just to present his views on politics or discuss interesting aspects of scientific history. Similarly problematic, his thesis is so broadly stated that it implies no belief is formed for rational reasons, which certainly goes too far.It's still a pretty good book, despite the flaws, and has some good insights into how many of our beliefs are often formed through psychological rather than rational reasons. I wonder, though, if better books for that purpose might be 
SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable

The Belief Instinct: The Psychology of Souls, Destiny, and the Meaning of Life
 by Jesse Bering.Original review was August 2011. Edited March 2105 to add:Rereading this now, I'm surprised how kind I was in the review, given how disappointed I remember being in the book. I was probably forgiving because I wanted at the time to like it. On the other hand, my perspective looking back on this Michael Shermer Manifesto is surely colored by the very negative view of the man himself I gained not long after, much influencing my happiness to get quickly rid of the book. Either way, I'm knocking my rating from three stars down to two and recommending the nicely specific one-star Socraticgadfly review."
296,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662822-josiah,4,"Although you may not agree with all of Shermer's own beliefs for whatever reason, this book is not about simply espousing and defending his own understanding of the way the world works. It is a book seeking to understand why the explanatory pronouncements we cling to hold so much weight to the individual.He opens with three stories; stories I thought would belie the overall theme of the book (Shermer being a pronounced skeptic/atheist). While this belief about the book would not and did not keep me from picking it up, I was surprised to find a more humble beginning. These stories were that of an individual who had a spiritual experience, the story of the faith of Francis Collins (lead scientist on the Human Genome Project and committed Christian), and his own journey from faithful student of psychology at the religious Pepperdine University to atheist and skeptic. He makes it clear that believing things that are or seem odd is not a question of intelligence; we all have beliefs that are unprovable or illogical, and smart people believe weird things because they're able to rationalize them better.If you are looking for a book to help you empathize with others, read a book on how the human psyche is flawed. We all believe we are correct and we all have rational reasons why what we believe is correct. We do not believe non-truths intentionally. If you remember that our intuitions are 60% products of our experience and 40% products of our genes, you begin to see the weakness of our opinions; and not simply our neighbor's, but also our own.My favorite portion of the book was the chapter on political and moral beliefs. In this section, he covers moral intuitions that, by their varied strengths and weaknesses in individuals, form the variations of political beliefs we see in our own group, as well as the incomprehensible beliefs of those on the opposite end of the spectrum.Overall, this was a interesting read filled with information I did not possess prior to reading (as many pop-science books ultimately are filled with). I definitely recommend it to those seeking a more humble approach to the individual worldview."
297,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"Naturally, I am a big fan of Dr. Shermer; as thinking people we all should naturally be. His insightful skepticism is not only an admirable way of approaching the world, it is a necessary way of doing so. The skeptical scientific approach to problem solving, to analysis, bypasses any belief-centric biases that might otherwise cloud our judgments.In this work, Shermer compiles his years of research into what very well might be his magnum opus: why we believe. In this scientific approach, he examines the underlying reasons for why we believe in general, not just the “weird things” he has addressed before. He offers concrete logical facts about the approaches we take in our beliefs and shows, quite clearly, that after the belief is hardwired in our brains, we then seek the evidence to justify it. The scientific skeptic will attempt to reverse this innate pattern, though not without some difficulty. We all have our blind spots.As even does Dr. Shermer. One of the weakest points of the book was his analysis of political beliefs. Though he was very insightful regarding conservative versus liberal ideologies – primarily, that each side thinks the logic and evidence is on his or her side of the argument – he does not apply the same in depth analysis towards his own well known and deep-rooted libertarian ideology. This section would have worked far better if, instead of pitting it as conservative v liberal, he examined all political beliefs equally. One gets the sense that Shermer is reacting to the prevalence of the two major political world views with some condescension. By doing so he not only undermines his thesis, but, interestingly, by having a whiff of superiority about the true libertarian philosophy he ends up supporting his thesis even more! It seems Dr. Shermer is not immune. Perhaps that was his point all along.Shermer is one of our most articulate heirs to the genius of Carl Sagan. This book is a fitting supplement to Sagan’s Demon Haunted World. Where Sagan taught one how to be a skeptic, Shermer reveals the underlying neurology of what the skeptical mind is up against."
298,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"I read 3 Shermer books tonight and which one said what get's a bit jumbled because they retread themselves so much so let me give my response to the thinker himself, because what's in these three books doesn't bother me so much as what isn't: Shermer is an intellectual coward.It's damn easy to say ""We're way more advanced than Neanderthals, and the Nazis were evil. I don't believe in God because you can't prove it exists, and alien abduction stories are interesting examples of something like anti-scientific thinking."" And he does, three times at least, and in one he throws out the real brain-stretch ""Rand had a point, but was too culty, and we should really be asking what's wrong with liberals, not conservatives!"" Look mate, you can't offer what Dawkins does to defend evolution, and evolution doesn't need defending anyway, you can't offer what Pinker and Harris can on morality, and nobody should bloody well try to follow in their chauvinistic shoes anyhow, they're assholes. And fuck me but Hitchens needs to be forgotten. These books are fine for 12 year olds who have never been asked to think critically -- which is far too many of them, so these books have a place -- but bravery is standing against the evil of today, and recognizing that is exactly what it is, evil. What America does for the sake of empire and industry is evil -- the fact no individual person makes a decision to be evil does not negate or even mitigate this, the phrase ""banality of evil"" exists for a reason, and you didn't bloody invent it (one of these three books he says ""what I call""). Chomsky and Hedges write books for adults, Shermer writes books for children."
299,0805091254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Shermer says we believe first and justify afterward. We operate this way he believes because we are designed by evolution to see patterns that convey meaning and to see forces that convey agency.The author's theme has been around for awhile, but he anchors it in evolutionary theory. His argument goes in the right direction but seems to bounce back on itself because Shermer is satisfied with bodily chemicals and the believing neuron and leaving it at that. We look for patterns and agency to make sense and explain, but isn't there more to this than that? Why do we believe in an afterlife? If we are designed by body-chemicals to survive, then thinking about an afterlife after death makes a lot of sense. Is God merely an intentional agent who provides an explanation for the world or is God the super alpha leader who protects us in this life and the next? Do we see demons because we are laden with fear for the survival of ourselves and those we love? Do we conform to group belief systems because group solidarity is central to our survival? Do we insist on right belief and right behavior because these are essential to placate the alpha god to assure our afterlife? And, overall, what is the relationship between overactive fear and our belief systems?Shermer does not give much attention to how we deal with beliefs in all the bogeymen that are out there, other than to say that we need more science and skepticism. Given the author's own premise that our belief systems are anchored in biology, that premise seems questionable."
