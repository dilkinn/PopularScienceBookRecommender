0,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Book of the year, 2013, for me. 7 pure gold, very twinkly, high-in-the-sky stars. If you like anthropology and history you'll like this. If you don't think you like those subjects, you might still like this because it is wonderfully well-written and very enlightening.If I ever get round to reviewing again, ie. if I ever get over being pissed off at Goodreads for turning into an authors' marketplace, for deleting and censoring reviews and shelves, for sharing my reviews, all of them, with Google when I denied permission, then this will be one of the first books I will review."
1,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4046061-seth-kolloen,2,"Extremely disappointing. There are a few interesting chapters, but I probably skimmed about 60% of the book. There is a lot of long-winded explanation of things that any high school student probably knows (languages are disappearing - people are fat - religious people sometimes go to war!) The last third especially just seems like Diamond spouting off about nutrition and education with very little tied back to the supposed theme of the book. Really felt like about a 60 page book that was just expanded to make it marketable. Honestly, I feel like I was ripped off."
2,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"Reading this book I remembered why I liked Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies so much: the clear line of argument, the logical structure, the transparency about sources and methodology, etc., all these criteria of a sound scientific work, they came back in this book, or at least partly.This book has been applauded, but also highly criticized, especially because Diamond relied mainly on his own experiences (in Papua New Guinea) and on some other studies of traditional societies elsewhere, and apparently had made completely wrong estimates of the available data, for example in comparing the level of violence in traditional and modern societies. I can understand both critiques: a number of chapters indeed mainly are based on personal experiences, and, of course, Diamond not has been able to read all anthropological literature. But he is always very honest about that, and he constantly warns against generalizations or indicates that his source material is rather limited.The second point of criticism is bit more difficult to evaluate. I have the impression that in most cases the comparisons Diamond makes between the levels of violence in traditional and modern societies are sound. But it is right that he remains blind to the ravages that the advent of modernity has wrought among native populations. He does point out that these societies were themselves pacified, because the modern states had taken over the monopoly on violence, but then does not mention the violence and discrimination of those modern states themselves against their native population (in Australia, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.), and that's certainly an obvious mistake. Contrary to what some reviewers write, Diamond does not go along with the classic praise to the “noble savage”. He clearly highlights the disadvantages of life in traditional societies. That said, he also points out some positive aspects that we, modern Westerners, might well learn from. Rightly so. But if you see the list of his conclusions, you may be disappointed: they are very predictable. We should live healthier, exercise more, and eat more nutritiously, take better care of our elderly, better educate our children about the past, and in our legal system we should be more mindful of mediation and compensation. It are all things that our newspapers already are full of. Yet there are two aspects that Diamond introduces that were new and interesting to me: the principle of constructive paranoia, and the contribution of emotional aspects to conflicts. Constructive paranoia refers to the attitude of traditional societies to continuously assess dangers and risks and take them into account in their behavior; a strong contrast is that with consciously looking up (and kicking on) risks in our western societies. And in conflict resolution traditional societies especially focus on the restoration of relations between the conflicting parties, and the manifest emotional input therein.Personally I enjoyed the concrete stories that Diamond tells about his experiences during his many stays in New Guinea. Of course, they give a distorted picture, and you should certainly not generalize them, but they make the picture of life in a traditional society much more tangible. It is a pity that he mainly discusses these experiences in the first part (about conflicts) and the second part (about dealing with young and old), and much less in the others.My biggest criticism of this book is that it has no clear focus. For example, in the last chapter we are presented with dozens of pages about what salt and sugar do to our health and how dangerous high blood pressure and obesity are, including guidelines for a healthier diet. Certainly as the book progresses, the emphasis is much less on how things are (or were) in traditional societies than on how in the modern West we do things wrongly. In that respect, the quality of this book is clearly less than its more well-known Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies."
3,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869305-milton-soong,4,"Four stars for content, 3 stars for style.This is from the author of Guns, Germs, and Steel. I liked that book for the content and insight it presented, but thought that it's too verbose (i.e. lots of repetition of the same idea to get the point across). This book suffers the same issue. Ideally the information can be presented via a series of long form magazine article instead of a tome, but I guess books makes more money..One difference about this book to his previous is that this work is a combination of history and advocacy. He presents how traditional societies (mostly represented by tribesmen of New Guinea which he is very familiar with, with sprinking of examples from other native tribes of America and Africa thrown in) differs from ours. The advocacy part then kicks in on what the author think we can learn from these societies. Some folks doesn't like to get preached to when they read history so YMMV.Some highlights:- One should not romanticize traditional society, life is harsh. Childhood mortality rate is as high as 2/3. Few lives beyond 40 years old.- Binary world view: People you meet are either people you know (kin and family of the same tribe), or they are enemy. A stranger is by definition an enemy (because he is a threat and competitor to your food source).- Agriculture is the dividing line: Traditional society = hunter gatherer. Once agriculture is discovered that society will head toward what we call ""modern civilization"".- One is constantly in a state of war. Violence can erupt anytime. Death rate percentage wise is much higher than modern warfare like WW1/WW2.- One is immersed with ones tribesmen. People are constantly talking and communicating. Privacy is unknown (adults will be having sex in the same room as their children).- Children discover sex much earlier than modern folks. Childhood games often have sexual overtone.- There are no law. Cultural custom rules the land (the author has a interesting story about a modern driver who had a hit and run incident and killed a child. Rule number one is after a hit and run you should immediately flee the scene and visit the local police, else the victims family and tribe is likely to lynch you on the spot).- All disputes are resolved via arbitration (remember, no law). So a hit and run wrongful death incident will involve you sending out emissary to reps of the victim to work out a ""deal"".- Concept of Justice in this case is very different. The result of dispute resolution is not to establish right and wrong, but to come up with a ""deal"" so that relationship can be restored to a status quo ante. This is important because any disputes are likely with people close to you (i.e. neighboring tribes) that you will have to deal with later in life. The concept in our world of disputes/crime with strangers doesn't really exist for them.This is one part of the custom that the author is advocating for disputes among people you know (i.e. divorce, or inheritance fights) because one want to preserve relationship afterwards. An adversarial court preceding is a bad way to resolve these issues.- Even if such a ""deal"" is reach among the principals, it doesn't mean it's settled. A victim's uncle might decide that the deal was not satisfactory, so you then have a blood feud on your hand. You might get an arrow 2 years from now because of this.- Dangers abound, so folks are paranoid by our standard.- They are much healthier in terms of diseases like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc.- They are much less healthy in terms of infection, epidemics, etc.- They are physically active by our standard.- Paleo diet works if you want to lose weight.- (late addition) Being a crib bilingual means the person will grow up and handle change better. There are some fascinating experiments outlined in the book to prove this with babies..."
4,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385615-david,2,"You need to know right up front that I am going to really rag on this book. I read every single word of it and feel qualified to tell you it was poor in many respects. It would be so much nicer to praise and compliment Diamond's efforts here but I'd be lying if I told you anything other than ""this was a painful experience"". If you stick with my review, however, I will tell you toward the end what it takes this author 466 pages to say. (Please don't expect anything revelatory. His conclusions are the very definition of mundane.)In summary there are some interesting ideas presented in a style that is excessively wordy. Actually he vomits onto the page incessantly. And it's incredibly frustrating because syntax and grammar are generally not his problems. (He does use ""regime"" when he means ""regimen"" and wrongly differentiates between Parasitic and Infectious Diseases, but these are minor quibbles.) He simply can't help himself from droning on and on with the result that he is pedantic. And the repetition is stultifying. Here is just one example:""In each such case, as I detailed two paragraphs above for Alaska's Inuit, the coastal partner has preferential or sole access to marine or coastal resources such as marine mammals and fish and shells, while the inland partner has preferential or sole access to territorial resources such as game, gardens and forests.""He recognizes that he just said this. So he has to tell us that he just said this. And then he has to say it all over again in his formulaic, textbook fashion. How did this man ever win a Pulitzer Prize?Many of his ideas are already well-established or so obvious as to be rather anticlimactic. And yet Diamond seems not to understand that. Even the most basic principles are identified and explained (and illustrated) for his reader. Check out this beaut on page 61:""The first surprise for the Highlanders would have been to discover that our overwhelmingly prevalent method of acquiring an item is not by barter but by paying for it with money (Plate 33)."" Turn to plate 33 which is a photograph of a white guy using cash to buy a gallon of paint at the counter of a hardware store. Good Lord...Other problems include a shifting perspective in favor of third-world views which undermines objectivity. The section titled ""Advantages of the Modern World"" lists the many reasons members of traditional societies (Aboriginal Pygmies, New Guinea Highlanders, Amazonian Hunters) give for wanting to adopt First World lifestyles; the section titled ""Advantages of the Traditional World"" lists the many terrible things these same individuals find upon moving to the U.S. Really? These are quite clearly Disadvantages of the Modern World. Why not just say so?Drum roll, please. Here is what we can all learn from traditional societies:Do not smoke.Exercise regularly.Limit your intake of total calories, alcohol, salt, sugar, saturated fats and processed foods.Increase your intake of fiber, fruits, vegetables and calcium.Eat more slowly.Decrease sedentary activities, especially screen time, unless it comes to meals which should be social/communal and relaxed.Following this summation, Diamond writes: ""This advice is so banally familiar that it's embarassing to repeat it."" Yes, it most certainly is.Do yourself a favor and don't cause further embarrassment by reading every word of this book like I did. We must all learn from one another's mistakes."
5,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,5,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/01/15...The main argument: The onset of agriculture and farming some 11,000 years ago (termed the Neolithic Revolution), is arguably the most significant turning point in the history of our species. Agriculture induced a major population explosion, which then led to urbanization; labor specialization; social stratification; and formalized governance—thus ultimately bringing us to civilization as we know it today. Prior to the Neolithic Revolution—and extending back time out of mind—human beings lived in a far different way. Specifically, our ancestors lived in small, largely egalitarian tribes of no more than 50 to 100 individuals, and hunted and foraged for their food.The transition from our traditional hunting and gathering lifestyle, to early farming (and herding), to civilization as we know it now (which, on an evolutionary time-scale, occurred but yesterday) has certainly brought with it some very impressive benefits. Indeed, many of us today enjoy comforts and opportunities the likes of which our more traditional ancestors would never have dreamed of. However, it cannot be said that the transition from traditional to modern has left us without any difficulties. Indeed, some would go so far as to say that the problems that civilization has introduced outweigh the benefits that it has brought; and even the most unromantic among us are likely to agree that our experiment in civilization has not been an unmitigated success.This then brings us to the problem of solving the difficulties that civilization has left us with. Now, when it comes to solving our problems, it is without a doubt the spirit of our age to look ever forward for solutions—by which I mean we tend to look for new technologies and hitherto untested arrangements to help us out of our current predicaments. However, when we consider that our traditional lifestyle served us well for millennia on end, and that it was under this lifestyle wherein we underwent much of the biological and psychological evolution that lives with us to this day, we can begin to see how it may be fruitful to look back at this traditional lifestyle for possible solutions to the problems we now face. (This idea is not new; indeed, the ‘state of nature’ has traditionally been of great interest to philosophers—for it has been thought that understanding how we lived by nature may serve as a guide to help us design the most fitting political communities given our present circumstances).Also of interest here—and deeply connected to the more practical goal mentioned above—is that investigating our traditional way of life promises to shed light on our underlying human nature in a way that is not possible when we look at ourselves through the obscuring artifice of civilization. It is these things that we stand to gain by learning about traditional societies, and it is this very project that geographer Jared Diamond takes up in his new book The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies?Diamond is certainly not one to deny that civilization has brought with it many important benefits over our traditional way of life (the most important of which, according to the author, being that state governments are much more effective at ending the cycles of violence that tend to plague traditional societies). However, Diamond does contend that there are many areas wherein traditional practices represent an improvement over how we do things in the modern world, and that these practices could (and should) be incorporated into our modern way of life (both at the personal and societal level). Specifically, we could afford to learn a thing or two from traditional societies when it comes to conflict resolution (how to re-establish and mend relationships); raising children (that it really does take a whole village to raise a child); treating the elderly (that they are deserving of respect, and are still capable of contributing to the community in many important ways); approaching risk (with extensive caution); communicating (in a face to face way, and with multiple languages); and in diet and exercise (favoring natural foods, reducing salt, and sugar intake, and adopting a more active lifestyle).In the course of his exploration of traditional societies, Diamond also delves into why and how our ancestors transitioned from traditional societies to civilizations (with a focus on such areas as social, economic and political stratification, and also religion).Diamond has made a career out of studying the traditional societies of Papua New Guinea, and is therefore a very credible authority on the subject matter at hand. What's more, his wealth of experience has left him with a trove of interesting and illuminating anecdotes to draw from, and these are on full display here. Finally, I felt that the author always maintained a very sober and balanced view with regards to the benefits and drawbacks of both traditional and modern societies. I would have liked to have seen certain topics discussed more, and others less, but this is mere personal preference. Altogether a very good book. A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/01/15... A podcast discussion of the book is also available."
6,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,0,"I agree with David Brooks who reviewed this book in January 2013 that much of its essential idea— that the West can learn from traditional and small-scale societies—doesn’t really leap off the page. Brooks’s point is that the reader doesn’t really get to meet individuals of traditional and primitive societies, and that undermines Diamond’s arguments that the West try alternatives to its present justice system. One idea that I Iiked was emotional mediation in some cases of murder. Here the killer and his victims are brought together to face each other over a table and talk about how the loss of a loved has affected them or, in the case of the killer, a show of remorse. This may seem preposterous on its face, but for those so inclined such an approach can provide closure for the parties that most present Western systems of justice cannot, since parties in Western disputes tend to talk at each other through adversarial intermediaries called attorneys. I can also see why Diamond sticks to discussing traditional and small-scale societies from the perspective of populations, since a divagation to an individual’s story might skew his arguments unduly. Having said that I also see how the populations approach appears inherently anti-individualistic and even Marxist. Marxist intrusions into the social and behavioral sciences in the second half of the 20th century were horrendously counterproductive, but I do not believe that is the author’s intent here. Nevertheless, the lack of human stories makes for rough sledding. There are some, but very few. So a bit of a narrative Catch-22."
7,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"BOTWhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r...BBC Blurbs:  Drawing upon several decades of experience living and working in Papua New Guinea, Professor Diamond shows how traditional societies can offer an extraordinary window into how our ancestors lived for millions of years - until virtually yesterday, in evolutionary terms - and provide unique, often overlooked insights into human nature. Exploring how tribal peoples approach essential human problems, from child rearing to old age to conflict resolution to health, Diamond reminds us that the West achieved global dominance due to specific environmental and technological advantages, but Westerners do not necessarily have superior ideas about how to live well.5* Guns, Germs and Steel5* Collapse4* The Third Chimpanzee1* Why is Sex Fun3* The World Until Yesterday"
8,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is a fascinating, comprehensive view of life in several traditional cultures. The best part of the book is the personal insights that Jared Diamond delivers. Diamond spent a lot of time with the peoples of Papua New Guinea, and he enthusiastically describes all facets of their lives. He contrasts their society with other traditional societies living in the Arctic, in Africa, and with modern, Western societies. There are hundreds of ""tribes"" living in New Guinea. Many of these tribes have long-standing enmities with their neighbors. It is very dangerous for people to move from one area to another, because of vendettas that span across generations. Many people have never traveled more than a few miles from the place where they were born. Some people who live within 50 or 100 miles of the coast are not even aware of the ocean. As a result, their languages and customs remain distinct from one another.This is a wonderful book, because Diamond describes the societies from first-hand knowledge, living among people in New Guinea. He has many interesting stories to tell, including a number from his first-hand experiences there. I especially like the story about his bird-watching expedition into an isolated region by helicopter, over 20 miles from the nearest inhabitants. All went swimmingly, until he came to a small clearing, where a guide pointed out a small stick with a few leaves stuck in the ground. Such an innocuous object was alarming to the guide, as it implied that the territory had recently been visited--and perhaps claimed--by others.The book does tend to repeat unnecessarily, and occasionally to ramble. Towards the end of the book, Diamond makes a point of showing how the diets of traditional societies may be healthier than Western diets. People in traditional societies rarely are overweight, get diabetes, heart disease, and so on. This is an excellent point, although Diamond turns the chapter into a sort of self-help manual. I enjoyed his emphasis, but it was sort of distracting."
9,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"It's always exciting when Jared Diamond publishes a new book and the advance copies were hugely sought after when they arrived at the office in October. This is the most personal of Diamond's books, with many anecdotes from his work in New Guinea. It reads like the book he's always wanted to write. The title is a comment that, in the context of history, we all, until recently, lived in traditional societies and Diamond describes key elements of that lifestyle. I found the beginning, where Diamond compares and contrasts traditional and modern societies, especially with reference to the execution of justice, forced. But the explicit drawing of lessons from traditional societies soon ends, leaving the reader to draw their own conclusions, and from here the book is an excellent and flowing read. Diamond effortlessly discusses, among other things, childhood, safety, religion, and language, describing how every society's structures are responses to particular contexts. He ends with observations about the fate of traditional societies today which points to where we ourselves may be heading. The World Until Yesterday is the natural extension of Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse as a masterly commentary on humanity and society.I'm on Twitter: @Dr_A_Taubman"
10,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"I read this because it looks at several groups from Papua New Guinea while exploring the differences between ""modern"" and ""primitive"" societies. Since the author spends 7% of his life in Papua New Guinea, at least half the examples of primitive societies come from that area, and he fills in the concepts with research (his own and others', current and historic) from other traditional societies around the world.There is a lot here - warfare, language, diet, disease, family units. I was most intrigued by the suggestions in the parenting and elderly chapters for what we might want to consider adopting again because of the benefits to personal and societal health. The economic implications were interesting as well, in fact the author suggests that major mistakes like the Harvard endowment debacle of 2008 may have been stalled if they thought more like Papua New Guinea sweet potato farmers.As a book on Papua New Guinean culture, this isn't where I would start because it includes bits and pieces in a larger context. I only say that since that is why I included it in my (now) three months of reading books from and about New Guinea. But for a book wide in scope about traditional societies, I doubt you'll find anything better! Just don't be surprised if you find yourself having conversations about breastfeeding while you're in the middle of it. It's really inescapable."
11,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,3,"This is a frustrating book to review. It touches on a lot of interesting subjects, but avoids discussing many of the most thought-provoking implications. It has sections of research picked almost randomly in support of alternately prudent and ridiculous opinions. It's heavy on analysis, yet it doesn't have many clear prescriptions at all. Its subject is vast, yet his focus is often very narrow. I liked many parts of it, but overall it's unquestionably a step down from his past 2, even though it clearly seems to be a more heartfelt book. In the grand continuum of popular science books, it's much closer to the ""pop"" end, and even given the fact that it's impossible to satisfy all types of popular science readers, I have no idea who the target audience is supposed to be. His subject is the cultural practices of several groups of traditional societies, and the lessons that us Westerners can learn from their practices. In a way it's a return to the first chapter of Guns Germs & Steel, but instead of asking ""how did the West get so advanced?"", he's asking ""are there things we can still learn from the people we've out-developed?""It's a reasonable question, and anyone who has devoted any thought to the long-term effects of our overweight, overstressed, overmedicated, atomized modern lifestyles (""WEIRD"" in his acronym - Western Educated Industrial Rich Democratic) will find some value in his high-level survey of the ways that traditional societies handle various aspects of the human condition like conflict, child-raising, religion, diet, the role of the elderly, and the like. He tends to split his analysis into either anecdote-heavy descriptive passages that involve his pals in New Guinea, or slightly more rigorous conceptual sections that discuss things like the various functions of religion or the types of political changes that occur when societies grow from a few hundred hunter-gatherers to millions of specialized citizens. There's good stuff in both types of sections, but... (as usual, ignore the first half of any sentence that has a ""but..."" in it).My problem with the anecdotal sections is that though the narrative format is a good way to make your points more vivid, it's also a good way to make them less rigorous. It's all very well to tell people that ""constructive paranoia"" (minimizing risks through careful skepticism) is a helpful way to live, but even though he has some neat stories about mysterious forest sorcerers, almost dying in a canoe accident, and running around on remote mountain peaks, my reaction was basically ""cool story bro"" - are these either generalizable in any way to Western lives, or even anything more than an over-elaborate way to say ""watch out for danger""? He also tosses in anecdotes that are simply absurd, like the one about the Kenyan who didn't like American toys because Kenyan toys were more interactive and better at encouraging mechanical creativity. Hence the global leadership and supremacy of Kenyan industry? Ditto again for stories about how much more isolating modern society is than than the constant communication and contact in traditional societies. This is certainly true, but it seems odd to package a criticism of solitary entertainment like TV, video games, or books in the form of a book which can only be appreciated by reading or listening to it alone.As far as the more data-heavy sections are concerned, I don't think any of the science is outright wrong, but I can see why this book annoys specialists in several scientific fields. Diamond picks really big topics, like The Role of Religion In Society, or The Effects of Increasing Scale On Societal Organization, and sums them up in a few pages of text and maybe a table or two. This is either admirable trans-specialty synthesis, or over-simplification on an epic scale, and the trend was increasingly towards the latter as the book went on. For example, late in the book he talks about the sharp decrease in global language diversity and the disappearance of many traditional languages. I personally am not very sentimental about languages in and of themselves, even English, and so his pathos-filled arguments for the preservation and continuation of languages with just a few thousand speakers didn't do much for me. Suppressing speakers of Breton is bad, I agree, and I think his advocacy of bilingualism is solid, yet the fact that all languages eventually change or die out doesn't really bother me in a metaphysical sense; that my nth generation descendants might be speaking SpaceMandarin instead of NeoEnglish is fine with me. Also, Diamond correctly points out that death rates from all kinds are much higher in traditional societies than modern ones: are there any evolutionary consequences to this? He doesn't say.Ultimately I wasn't very satisfied with the book. Certainly we should give more thought to whether the vast changes in lifestyle encouraged by modernity are really good for us in the long run, but I found the evidence that Diamond gave insufficient to conclude that New Guinean highlanders have much to teach us. What made Guns Germs & Steel and Collapse such good books to me was their rigorous sourcing, his broad synthesis of those sources, and the careful way his specific claims about imperialism and sustainability emerged from those things. This book is a decent overview of the cultural practices of some groups of traditional societies, but it feels like a huge let-down from those two works, simultaneously too lengthy and too unclear.Also, the airport frame story technique was almost intolerably Thomas Friedman-esque. Cut that stuff out."
12,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16855847-david,4,"""Guns, Germs and Steel"" is Dr. Diamond's masterpiece and this book augments what we learned from it. (I haven't read Chimpanzee yet or some of the others.) I love this man for teaching us so well, even though he talks about a part of the world in which I have had no interest. His insights open cracks in my brain that have been sealed with the creosote of intellectual arrogance-- false assumptions. Many of our Goodreads friends have reviewed this book better than I can, and I encourage all to read each review. Perhaps because he has covered this material in other works, I found it a little repetitive and not as revolutionary. When you look at experience through the eyes of the ""primitive"" you are looking at life as a child, but a child who is becoming wise. All seekers should read Jared Diamond's whole canon of work."
13,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,3,"Consider me a big Jared Diamond fan. I read Guns, Germs, and Steel twice, Collapse once, and have watched all the video documentaries. There is no question that Diamond is a consummate researcher and will always have a special place in helping me understand how human societies have come about.This book, however, was a vague disappointment. Not because the book was bad, but because I had such high expectations of it. It seemed to me that he had a bunch of notes and journal entries left over that did not fit into the earlier works, and now here they are, jumbled together with an attempt at an overall theme, but more jumble than theme.What I did find fascinating is the view of the primitive cultures in New Guinea. I personally have no feeling for what these cultures are like, and this book will give you a certain feeling and understanding. Death and murder is a part of everyday life. Particularly poignant is the Inuit who will probably be killed for trespassing, even when the trespassing was completely accidental, caused by ice breaking off and drifting into another tribe's territory. Our modern state-oriented sense of fairness rebels at the idea that both sides know that no fault is assigned, and yet killing has nothing to do with fault. We certainly take it for granted that we can stop the car in any small town in America, get out, and walk around with really a very low chance of any problem. A native New Guinean lives in a 7 mile radius, not because they lack curiosity or stamina to go further, but because it is incredibly dangerous to do so.Chapter 2 is about accidents and justice, and how restoring relationship is the goal in traditional cultures, while in state societies justice means either punishment or compensation.Chapter 3 & 4 is about war and violence. He does highlight the differences between traditional cultures and ours.Chapter 5 is about raising children, while chapter 6 was about how the old are treated. Some hints of a romantic idea that kids are so much better when they have to make their own toys, however infant mortality and accident rates are shockingly high. While it was interesting to see the differences, these chapters did not leave me with any real idea of how we might learn from these.Chapter 7 was a very very detailed account of a boat accident he endured, and the only point was that someone else, a native, had noticed the crew of the boat was misbehaving and decided not to be on the boat. The point? Some natives have a sense of danger that we westerners don't have. At the same time, we westerners have a sense in our environment of what is and is not dangerous as well. Why would anyone be surprised at this? The real message: people know their own world better than foreigners. Chapter 8 follow this with further interesting stories of native differences.Chapter 9 launches into a discussion of religion, and this chapter feels as if it was pulled from a completely different book. Clearly he has done a lot of thinking about this, and did not have enough material for a whole book on the subject, so this became chapter 9. Maybe the best chapter, but at the same time, understand that the same kind of hard evidence from the rest of the book is simply not possible on the subject of religion.Chapter 10 is a shallow argument that everyone should be a polyglot. He explains that there are 7000 languages, and the median language spoken by few thousand people. Surprisingly, in these traditional cultures, there are many languages spoken in a small area, and literally everyone speaks a handful of languages. He gives some evidence that people who a bilingual do better at something things than monolingual people, and this is done with the standard backdrop of how sad it is that so man people in USA are monolingual. This is followed by weaping and moaning for languages that are being ""steamrollered"" out of existence by modern states. However, he never once gives a reason that the world should have 7000 languages. Most of these languages are only spoken (never written) and he never explains why there is any harm at the loss of a language after the last speaker dies. Similarly, there is no assessment of the value of a common language, although we all know this is incredibly valuable today. This chapter was romantic and quite frankly unconvincing.Chapter 11 is on diet. Clearly, the modern diet is not healthy, and clearly we have a chronic problem with diabetes today. He gives plenty of evidence that this is a modern world (cultural) problem and not any kind of racial problem: what I mean is that tranditional people when they take up the modern lifestyle fall prey to all these problems equal to those who had many generations in the lifestyle. This is a worthy message, however the problem is complex, and no solution is provided. We know people need to be more active, and traditional cultures are generally more active. So in the end, not much real new insight comes out of this.That is about it: a few viewpoints of the differences of modern world compared to traditional world, backed up by copious, very detailed notes. Diamond remains one of the most important people to read, but not for this book."
14,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,3,"I am always angered by scientists and pseudo-scientists who take it for granted that the study of 'primitive' societies of today, or of several decades ago, provides a good insight into the life of the hunter-gatherers of 100,000 years ago, when the human species only consisted of that kind of people. It is a mistake that is very often made to see these 'primitive' societies as a kind of living fossiles, reflecting almost perfectly the life of so many years ago. This view ignores the fact that these societies kept on evolving on their own, and immediately adapted their way of life, even after the faintest contact with western people. I am not claiming that Diamond is committing the same mistake, at least not systematically, but several passages in this book implicitly take the faulty point of view for granted. Take the main title of this book, ""the world until yesterday"": even though 'yesterday' is not to be taken literally, this is absolutely wrong. In that respect, the subtitle: ""What we can learn from traditional societies"" covers the content much better. Because Diamond rightly points out that the classical social sciences give a completely distorted view of human reality: they only focus on people in the 'Weird' societies (Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic), and often only the US. He’s absolutely right that traditional societies must be seen as much more diverse experiments in human society and thus provide a broader and more accurate picture of what mankind really is. Seen from that angle, and despite its shortcomings, this is a valuable book that develops a number of creditable hypotheses. And fortunately, Diamond uses the term ‘traditional communities’ and not the odious ‘primitive’."

I found the chapters on child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and nutrition most informative and while not idealizing traditional societies, the author makes the case that there is, indeed, much we can learn from them."

Exploring how tribal peoples approach essential human problems, from childrearing to old age to conflict resolution to health, Diamond reminds us that the West achieved global dominance due to specific environmental and technological advantages, but Westerners do not necessarily have superior ideas about how to live well.Read by Crawford Logan.Abridged by Robin Brooks.Produced by Kirsteen Cameron.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r..."
17,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Within a relatively short timeframe humans have gone from living as hunter/gatherers in small tribes of a few hundred individuals, to agrarian communities comprised of thousands, to city-states of many millions with a broad division of labor and a representative form of government. This change in the structure of society has resulted in a dramatic alterations in lifestyle. While many of these changes have been positive (we live longer, are subject to less violence and have access to many goods and services that were unavailable to our ancestors), some of them are less so (epidemics of obesity and diabetes, and incidents of isolation). In The World Until Yesterday Jared Diamond examines traditional societies and the ways in which we may be able to learn from them in our era of sedentary desk jobs and virtual, on-line lives. Diamond examines such topics as: trade, conflict resolution, treatment of children and the elderly, risk, religion, language and diet. Although not an anthropologist by training, Diamond is known as a polymath and has spent quite a bit of time with tribes in New Guinea. His experiences lend anecdotal support to the conclusions he draws from anthropological research. Are there some overarching themes as to what we might learn from studies of tradition people? Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Traditional lifestyles tend to be both dangerous and violent. Inter-tribal conflicts result in a higher proportion of violent death (relative to population size) than is found in state-run societies and the incidence of genocide and infanticide are more prevalent. Traditional societies are generally unfamiliar with the scientific method and instead form supernatural explanations of natural events (yes .. we have Pat Robertson, but rational individuals look to science for answers). Finally, many of the activities that surround their daily life are dictated by fear. Whether it’s the lion that may be lurking in the grass or a shift in alliances that make interactions with the tribe next door uncertain, life is stressful and requires one to adopt a paranoid mindset (Diamond refers to this as “constructive paranoia”) in order to survive. With that said, there are some aspects of these cultures that we could learn from. In traditional societies, conflict resolution is often performed through a mediator whose goal may include both compensation and emotional closure for the victim. States resolve conflict through a court system which often provides little consolation for those that were harmed. Another area is in our treatment of children and the elderly. Some traditional groups give their children considerable freedom and revere their elders for their experience and knowledge. In state societies these demographics tend to be segregated from the larger population by age, leading to social isolation and little inter-generational learning. Finally, a quick glance at a cross section of our general population makes it abundantly clear that we have become soft, fat and unhealthy. Traditional populations had to work to survive and they only ate what they were able to collect, catch or grow. A sedentary lifestyle coupled with a diet high in fat, salt and sugar has led to a rise in heart disease, stroke and cancer. A return to a diet and active lifestyle that more closely resembles that of our ancestors could result in significant improvements in health. One area where I take issue with Diamond is with regards to language. There are currently in the neighborhood of 7,000 languages in the world and Diamond predicts that most will have vanished or be well on their way to having become so by the year 2100. He bemoans this loss and urges that heroic measures be taken to preserve them. While I agree with Diamond that language can help preserve a groups cultural identity in the face of the homogenizing influence exerted by the state, I just don’t see the loss of a language as a particularly tragic event. It is certainly a people’s right to keep their native language alive, and failing that, linguists are certainly welcome to do their best to preserve them if they so choose, but the fact is that most are fading through simple neglect. Young people don’t want to learn them and old people that retain these skills are dying. Perhaps it’s my lack of sentimentality, but I do not believe it’s a tragedy to let nature run its course. All languages change over time. It is active, engaged bodies that keep a language vibrant and alive. A language on life-support that people have forgotten how to speak is not a language at all but a museum piece. Diamond is one of the few scientists who can write well and explain his subject matter to a lay audience in an way that is interesting. Although the lessons he draws aren’t particularly novel or surprising (in fact, most are banal) the information about the various cultures he examines is interesting. Many of the conclusions regarding violence also dovetail nicely with those drawn by Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature. It was a happy coincidence that I read them back to back. I will say, however, that the book went on rather too long and becomes overly repetitive towards the end (I get it, our western diet sucks and we should eat more broccoli … thanks mom). "
18,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14830170-laurie-bryce,3,"I was underwhelmed by this book. Diamond keeps asking, ""What ideas and practices can we learn and adopt from traditional societies?"" and by the end of this very long book, I was thinking, ""Not much."" There's an interesting chapter on diet -- heart disease and diabetes and similar Western world causes of death are unheard of in hunter-gatherer societies -- and that really brings home how we are literally killing ourselves with our food choices. I can see what the ""Paleolithic diet"" boosters are getting at!So we can learn how to eat from our hunter-gatherer ancestors ... but what else? Across a wide range of traditional societies both in the past and in the few still existing in the present, their lives are apparently all too often brutally short and full of violence and suffering while they're alive. What's to emulate there?!The part that stayed with me -- and there's been a lot of press about this section -- is when he describes a traditional society, in the present day, that does not believe in protecting children from harm. They treat children basically as tiny adults, and make no attempt to stop an infant from crawling into a fire, for example, or to take a machete away from a toddler. Needless to say, the adults in this tribe are usually horribly scarred from burns and cuts suffered in childhood. I couldn't sleep after reading that part of the book. How could any human being, anywhere in the world, at any time in history, watch a baby crawl into a fire and do nothing to intervene? Maybe I was so shaken by this one image that I am unable to follow Diamond's suggestion to appreciate other aspects of traditional life that might be valuable to emulate. I mostly just felt grateful that we have things like safe food, hospitals, medicine and so on!"
19,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906389-hans-g,3,"Jared Diamond is quite famous for his well-argued ""geographical hypothesis"" for helping to explain global (continental) inequality (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies). This can be contrasted with the ""cultural hypothesis"" which relies more heavily on the role culture plays in explaining the social evolution and dissemination of technology (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)). These positions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but can be complementary. Indeed Diamond has argued for long-term periods and concerning ""continental"" trends the ""geographical hypothesis"" is more important, while for short-term periods and sub-continental or regional trends the ""cultural hypothesis"" takes precedence.Thus, according to Diamond if Historian's fail to explain the broadest patterns and exclusively focuses on cultural aspects, there is a large moral gap in our understanding of human society and social being. Likewise if there is an over focus on geography and technology, then there is a large moral gap in our anthropological understanding of day-to-day existence.In ""The World Until Yesterday"" Diamond attempts a greater synthesis than he has in his previous two books.This book will be a very interesting antidote toward Ian Morris's (The Measure of Civilization: How Social Development Decides the Fate of Nations) to be released in January 2013. I have also read an advanced copy of Morris's book, very little new in his book from his (Why the West Rules--for Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future). In Diamond's new book there is much new material, not necessarily in full agreement with his ""geographical hypothesis.""In this new book ""The World Until Yesterday"" the focus is on so-called tribal societies. Clearly, much more than in his recent work his focus is honed in on cultural factors. Diamond believes traditional societies have much to offer civil societies of modernity. Cultures of tribal society are capable of enriching our culture and lives today.Diamond maintains the watershed moment is the rise of state government and systems of law and courts.In tribal society a dispute would have to be solved face-to-face between members. Diamond does not argue the face-to-face interaction is necessarily better than legal court systems for resolving disputes, but to point out the difference are important and certain advantages do exists for tribal organization.Likewise Diamond is interested in how individuals in tribal society bring up their children, how elderly are cared-for, the role of religion, health, how we deal of danger and treats, etc. Again Diamond emphasizes there are strong differences between tribal and modern societies, some good some bad.Diamond is famous for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies."" In it he develops and defends a version of environmental determinism, attempting to explain why Europeans were able to conquer and colonize other nations around the world. His thesis argued Europe had an environmental advantage of plentiful plants and animals. The environmental advantage was the basis of disease immunity, greater health, etc, stimulating technological innovation and political organization and offering tremendous economic advantage.The `negation' of ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" is taken up in his next book ""Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"" (Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition). The thesis in ""Collapse"" is how environmental misfortunes and catastrophes help to explain the extinction of cultures and civilizations.""The World Until Yesterday"" makes Diamond's three books a true trilogy. Here he is arguing that societies of the past don't only collapse, but offer us insights into how to organize our own civilization to avoid collapse and extinction ourselves. For example he argues multilingualism has benefits. That certain dietary practices (e.g. too much salt and sugar) are bad for the individual, but also for the survival of civilization.As alluded above, Diamond is also interested in how treating our elderly and our infants and toddlers, young children more generally contribute to survival or collapse of civilization. Thus, bad parenting is not merely an individual event, but has consequences for civilization itself. Diamond also analyzes institutions of religion and their function in the successful reproduction of society.As in his previous books, Diamond is impressive in his synthesis of anthropology, evolutionary biology, sociology, human nutrition and physiology, economics, and linguistics. This is arguably the best book of the three. Although Diamond is rather elusive with conclusions, normative pronouncements are abundant. He clearly finds great merit in ""traditional"" practices of previous and current societies. At the same time his environmental/technology determinism shine through to remind us ""progress"" happens for a reason. Thus, his normative pronouncement are rather circumvented to suggest traditional practices may be able to reduce warfare, take better care of children and youth, and provide better care and empathy for the elderly and downtrodden.Diamond is always a fascinating and fun read. This book seems less of the environmental/technology determinism of his ""geographical hypothesis"" as argued strongly in his previous work.It provides much more room for culture. This is important, it is a major contribution to post-formalist anthropology. Five stars for what Diamond writes and develops. Two stars for what he fails to develop. What we can see from studying anthropology is limited. Diamond is groping to bring in culture, but in a far too limiting way. It is remarkably disappointing to discovery that what we have to learn from traditional societies (the very subtitle of the book) is to take better care of our children and elderly, to practice better nutrition, and to be kinder to one another. David Graeber's anthropology (Debt) is far more relevant to contemporary society, specifically written to understand power-relations and hegemonic movement of one culture to another. From Graeber we learn how power, debt and money have been used to conquer and control. From Diamond we learn how people should eat more nutritiously and be kinder to one another. Graeber, for me, is far more important and relevant for understanding contemporary society. "
20,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3808180-karmologyclinic,2,"Subpar for Jared Diamond, the feeling was more of unedited ramblings and an old man's memories, than anything consistent. Not that I necessarily disagree with his reasoning on many things but as a book, meh, no."
21,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2525024-lesley,4,Fascinating book comparing the world of hunter-gatherers with our own. In many ways the hunter-gatherers seem to have a better life!

22,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334225-steve,2,"First, to be honest: I didn't finish the book. After three weeks on loan from the library, I finally accepted that I just wasn't engaged enough to finish the book. The rest of this review covers why.I've always greatly enjoyed Jared Diamond's books and grabbed a copy of each one that I've run across. He does an excellent job of conveying a lot of information in an easy-to-read format and is normally fabulous at bringing together lots of information to make his case.But The World Until Yesterday lacks that Jared Diamond spark. It could be me; its focus on comparative aspects of human societies may just not float my boat (certainly it's not a must-grab topic for me). However, it seemed that the book wavered between two very different styles; one is that of an introductory textbook trying to cram lots of fact-based details in (talking about how different societies do things) and one is that of Diamond's own experiences (sometimes those of people he knows), which are sometimes revealing but more often come across as anecdotal and thus interesting but hard to generalize. At its most interesting, such as the health chapter, Diamond marshalls an array of facts while stepping out maybe a bit too far (his theory as to why European-descended populations have relatively low rates of diabetes given a Western diet is intriguing but the presented evidence is a bit flimsy). But the child-care and elder-care chapters were, to me, a tedious recitation of many differences that I had trouble keeping track of.His discussion of New Guinean ""constructive paranoia"" is very anecdotal and, while interesting, left me with very little of a takeaway beyond ""pay attention to your surroundings."" Which my mother tried to teach me, thank you. And she's a Westerner.In short, this book probably deserves more attention than I gave it. But for once, Diamond has not succeeded in earning that attention."
23,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531146-jan,1,"The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies? by Jared DiamondI was initially excited to read this book as the subject interests me. The premise is to understand how humans lived before modern civilization and to compare that to our lives now. Should we try to be more like ""traditional"" people in order to solve some of our problems?However, the more I read, the more irritated I became with the author's liberal attitude and sweeping claims. Many of the so-called 'facts' he stated were simply false, and for an author with Diamond's apparent reputation, that is deplorable. He concentrates on the people of New Guinea because that is where he did his own research, and also because those ""traditional"" peoples have been most recently introduced to what we call modern civilization. He does mention several other groups around the world that were, until quite recently, isolated and therefore ""traditional."" However, when comparing them to the societies of today, he often doesn't take into consideration major game-changers like religion or literature that have shaped every 'modern' civilization on Earth. I was very disappointed and could not finish this book. I cannot recommend it, unless of course you are an academic; in that case, you've probably already read it and loved it."
24,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4," This was the book I wanted ""Beyond Civilization"" to be. But I knew I wasn't getting that from Daniel Quinn. I'd not read Jared Diamond before, so wasn't sure what to expect. As interesting as nonfiction can be, I have such a hard time getting through it...they are seldom page turners. So while I liked this one, it did take me a long time to finish. The war and peace topics were alright...the question of how to interact with strangers in various societies and the strategies of state government vs tribal groups in their handling of justice were thought provoking. But the family and social aspects of raising children and aging were more along the lines I was wanting to read. The last chapters on religion, language and health were not what I was expecting for some reason, but make total sense in showing the contrasts between the modern and tribal ways of life. I feel like I need a rehash of some of the facts I read, to further consider them...but I just don't want to put the time into going back and rereading sections now (it's already overdue at the library, plus I have several fiction books waiting that will be quick reads!). But this is one I may have to revisit later. "
25,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3962628-sarah,4,"This is a long book. At times a bit boring, at others very interesting. Long winded but thorough. But the interesting parts are worth the short wade through the boring bits. The author discusses the major differences between modern living and tribal societies. He takes a very frank look at both and analyzes the pros and cons of each. Among these was the best discussion of social justice I have ever heard. And some very good points about how diet contributes to diabetes, with research among tribes who have gone from tribal to western-style-eating diabetics within one generation. Another note I found interesting was that some tribal cultures commit infanticide when babies are born too close together, because a mother cannot produce enough milk to feed two children. This is the first time I'd heard of such a reason for the practice, and shines a new light on it.The novel is centered much around New Guinea and the author's efforts to catalog new bird species there with the help of natives, so this will be an interesting read for anyone who is a fan of these topics.I'll be checking out more books by this author, whose won many writing and science awards for his works. "
26,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300439-paula,3,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Diamond's previous book Guns, Germs and Steel, I expected to like this one, and I did. However, the findings in this book pale in comparison to the previous one. There is little originality in his overriding conclusion that western civilization has traded community for convenience. His attempt to explain the origins of religious experience seems naive at best. He obviously has never experienced what he is trying to explain away. What I did like were the smaller insights like the mental benefits of being multi-lingual, and the connection between native diets and health. It was worth the read, but nowhere nearly as insightful as Guns, Germs and Steel. "
27,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171605-susan,4,"This is a fun read and the author an engaging, creative personality, up until he gets to the chapter on religion, when he gets somewhat disdainful. Is it really possible to dismiss God in a chapter? "
28,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,3,"Diamond ranges far and wide in looking at primitive societies and it is hard to not feel like he is picking and choosing so he can spend fifty pages ranting on talking about issues of his choice. Bilingualism? Check. Raising kids? Check. Religion? Check. Salt and sugar in our diets? Check.That isn't to say his rants aren't occasionally enjoyable and often enlightening, nor did I get the sense that he is purposefully pushing an agenda. The end result was a book that just as it started to get too irritating, the topic would shift or there would be a great anecdote and I got pulled back in. The best part is certainly bringing divergent ways of looking at how we should live as humans, but how to incorporate those into modern life is more complex than simply knowing what a New Guinea tribe would do in certain situations."
29,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75509692-akreid,2,"I didn't find this as compelling as Guns, Germs and Steel. It offers interesting facts about traditional societies but could probably do so in far fewer pages."
30,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11309590-brent-ranalli,4,"Jared Diamond's first blockbuster, Guns, Germs & Steel, was a tour de force marred by one serious flaw: In an excessive fit of political correctness, Diamond argued that the evidence he had marshaled about the influence of geography on the grand course of civilization not only made it unnecessary to hypothesize cultural superiority as the cause of the global dominance of Eurasian civilization, but also proved that all cultures are somehow ""equal"" (adaptively, morally). That conclusion doesn't follow from the evidence, and in fact the claim is absurd. Rome didn't come to dominate the Mediterranean, rather than some other city-state, because the Tiber river valley had a different geography than the Po. Rome dominated because it was warlike. And while any attempt to rank cultures on a moral basis would be fraught, few can doubt that modern Scandinavia and the Aztec empire, say, are leagues apart.The World Until Yesterday compensates for those errors, in more than one way. First, Diamond confronts cultural diversity head-on. It is a major theme of the book, and to the extent he generalizes about traditional cultures, he does so with appropriate hedges and caveats. Second, Diamond is much more careful about circumscribing what conclusions he draws and what interpretations his evidence supports, even to the point of being somewhat banal and pedantic.The great strength of the book is the personal anecdotes from Diamond's decades of travel and fieldwork in New Guinea and elsewhere. In many traditional societies, we learn, elders are a valuable resources on account of their accumulated stock of knowledge and wisdom. We get the sense that Jared Diamond, too, is an elder with a great deal of knowledge and accumulated wisdom to impart, and we have the good fortune to receive it.The book has been criticized by some anthropologists for painting an overly bleak view of warfare and violence in traditional societies and exaggerating the willingness of traditional peoples to ""choose"" to join state societies for the material and personal security it supposedly offers--and thus serving as an apologist for enemies of indigenous peoples' rights to autonomy. Diamond perhaps could have done more to illustrate the violence, substance abuse, and other psychic dislocations that often go along with the (often involuntary) transition into state societies. But on the whole, the points he makes are valid. If he is not an activist for indigenous political rights, he is neither a true opponent; he just takes a realist's view that everyone will come into the orbit of state society sooner or later.While Diamond's conclusions are generally sound, his arguments are not always. On the subject of taking risks, he carries on far too long a metaphor about taking shots in hockey. Professor Diamond, one does not take extra risks in a traditional society because one anticipates a short life span. One takes risks because one needs to eat! The chapter on religion too, though spot on in its main conclusions, offers several cringeworthy arguments.On the other hand, some of the pedantry can be forgiven. One might suppose that the value of language diversity is axiomatic and hardly requires discussion. Is it really necessary to rehearse arguments for multilingualism and language preservation? Well, apparently it is. The BBC has listeners who write in and say that minority languages should be actively suppressed, and Diamond quotes them. Well, then! Professor Diamond, go right ahead and we will admire and be entertained as you tear those asinine propositions, and the feeble arguments offered in support of them, to tiny shreds. (Starting with the point that English itself is technically a minority language. Shall we all switch over to Mandarin?)Ultimately, one might say the book is written for a high school reading level. It doesn't assume much sophistication about the ways of the world, but gently leads the reader through every point. I listened to the recorded version of the book, and in that medium the repetitiveness and long-windedness didn't bother me as much as it appears to have bothered some other reviewers."
31,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7855901-ryan,3,"The World Until YesterdayJared DiamondRead it in Hardback at 512 pages.Jared Diamond, you are a man of many talents and educational degrees who has travelled the world for a variety of reasons and are able to take many interesting conjectures from so many different points and spin them into a comprehensive and unique vantage point that dissect human history and aim to improve the human experience. This is why I read your books, despite the handy-cap of an unequal margin of intelligence. Last year I read Mr. Diamonds book titled Collapse and was intrigued and educated throughout its pages. This year as I was stumbling through Costco I decided to rummage past the book and media isle, something I usually try to actively not do, and saw this. Into the oversized cart it went.The World Until Yesterday takes a magnifying glass to what Diamond labels as Traditional societies compared to its modern counterparts and what we can learn from our roots. The broad parent topics include:1: Setting the Stage by Dividing Space - This section details out how modern and traditional societies handle their citizens, the threat of transients and unknowns, and also how we both decipher their intentions and deal with subsequent enemy menace. 2: Peace and War - The states of any society and how they handle these unsure topics. How societies treat their neighbors and how they war with their enemies. Both Traditional and Modern societies handle this interestingly and have different fallouts because of it.3: Young and Old - A common problem no matter what society you are part of is the fact that everyone gets old, but how does everyone deal with their elderly?4: Danger and Response - You think you may know what kind of dangers befall a traditional society but there is some really eye opening things in this heading about our westernized society.5: Region, Language, and Health: The bits about Health are scary, really scary, at least the implications of modernizing the world.The overall criticism of Diamonds writing is that it is too opinionated or that he pushes a conclusion and that his opinion is the only available logical conjunction. As each of his books come out I see less and less of this in his writing, except on the topics that are no brainers, and I don't know if that's in response to these criticisms or if the subject matter provides less opportunities to readily say which is the right way. Throughout reading The World Until Yesterday I was waiting for Mr. Diamond to tell me which was the right way but he rarely takes sides, except on the easily apparent, which I appreciated.3.5 rounding down for Goodreads."
32,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104746332-andreas-haraldstad,3,"This book provides an interesting exploration of human society as it existed until quite recently. It explores what Diamond labels ""traditional societies"", meaning societies existing in tribes or chiefdoms. Until very recently, about 11000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatheres, which we had done for hundred of thousands of years. This means, that agriculture and proceeding modern civilization is extremely recent. This could be taken even further. Modern industrial society is perhaps about 150-200 years old and in many regions, industrialization happened much later. Diamond exemplifies this by pointing at New-Guinea (an area in which he has lived and worked for decades) where the existence of large populations of hunter-gatheres and garden-farmers was revealed as late as in the 1930s. Having established how recent so called WEIRD (Wealthy, Educated, Rich, Industrialized and Democratic)-societies actually are. Diamond goes ahead describing 11 areas in which life in traditonal societies differ widely from modern societies. By providing plenty of anecdotes and examples, primarily from New-Guinea, but also from other traditional societies, he aims to show the benefits of modern state-societies, but also areas in which we have much to learn from traditional societies. Some downsides of traditional societies he shows are: constant violence, short lifespans, high mortality etc. While benefits of these kinds of societies are: healthy lifestyles, tight social bonds, some good child rearing practices ""justice systems"" providing closure for the victims etc. In general, this is an interesting book, but it falls short of his previous works such as ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse"". While this book is interesting, for me atleast, it provided very little new knowledge or new perspectives. The health benefits of traditional lifestyles and the benefits of state societies were already apparent to me, and probably will be for the majority of this books readers. However, I would still recommend it. If you enjoyed Diamond's previous books you will enjoy this one as well, and if you are not already somewhat familiar with the differences between traditional and state-societies, then this book will surely open your eyes to fascinating perspectives.

This book can be said to explore this myth with more details to determine where traditional living has an advantage and where modern aspects of our lives we would not do without. Diamond makes a slightly stronger point; by comparing traditional societies and modern ones we can uncover important features of human psychology.The problem remains that observations of traditional society are scant and sporadic. Diamond focuses almost exclusively on the Piraha indians, the !kung and the Papua New Guinea Highlanders because we know slightly more about those societies. Still it is very hard to conclude anything about benifits of certain differences; for instance traditional societies dont let their babies cry, does that make them more or less independent? Impossible to say without an exhaustive study to discern correlation from causation. There are a few cases where the traditional societies offer a counter example that shows how, for instance, the urge to outperform others is not an intrinsic human feature but a value of some societies. Another example is the possibility to meet a stranger without fearing for one's life. There are a few other instructive examples, but for the remainder of this large book we are left with nothing more than our first intuitions. Yes there are plenty of colorful anectodal situations, but they fail to bring a strong point such as in Collapse. Also, I did not find any particularly original hypotheses such as in Guns Germs and Steel. No, after 500 pages I can only say what I said at the beginning: everyone likes to say how much better it was in the good old days and this is only partially true."

The author reminds us that until very recently in human history most human beings lived in traditional cultures; hence, the title. My manager, who lent me this book, said he thought Diamond romanticized primitive cultures a little, but the book didn't read that way to me. Diamond definitely makes the point that we could learn some things about successful living from the way human beings lived for most of our history, but he is under no illusions about the benefits of good medical care, the rule of law, etc. He does point out how we are not evolved for our modern diet, which leads to obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. And he points out how crazy it is that our kids have so many toys that probably stunt their imaginations. So, yes, we can learn a something from more primitive cultures. But infanticide, elder abandonment, death from parasitic disease and vengeance killings? Good riddance! There are many good reasons why primitive people tend to abandon their way of live when they are exposed to the WEIRD way of life: Overall, our way is better. But it is still interesting to know how our not-so-distant-in-the-big-picture ancestors lived. "

In this book he uses his knowledge of ""primitive"" contemporary societies to demonstrate what life was like before the advent of civilisation as we know it.Some good insights but it dragged a little for me and I would recommend his books collapse and guns germs and steel ahead of this oneCollapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or SucceedGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies"
36,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30364304-arkadi-cloud,2,"After being mightily impressed with Jared Diamond's book ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"", I am disappointed with this one. Some interesting information in here but doesn't feel like a cohesive book. His information about New Guinea is the most interesting. Some chapters were really difficult to get through as they were as dry as a Wikipedia page. A lot of what's in the book doesn't feel well researched, seems more like his thoughts and impressions. He probably should've written a book just about New Guinea life, and there's no way this book needed to be 400+ pages. I hope his book ""Collapse"" which is sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read is more thrilling than this one."

""Guns, Germs and Steel"" modified my world-view drastically. ""The world until yesterday"" is a very personal work with plenty of anectodes from Mr. Diamond's own experience in the New Guinea. Sure there are some interesting tidbits of information, but there weren't many enough and the book lacked coherence. There isn't much discussion of what we can actually learn.

38,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies? by Jared Diamond""The World Until Yesterday"" is an informative book that illustrates a spectrum of ways in which we can use our understanding of traditional societies. It’s a study of all aspects of human culture of all peoples around the world, for the last 11,000 years. Pulitzer Prize-winning author of his magnum opus “Guns, Germs, and Steel” and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and too many achievements to list here, Dr. Jared Diamond provides the readers with insight into traditional societies on how they are similar and unlike us. This illuminating 513-page book contains eleven chapters grouped into five parts: 1. Setting the Stage by Diving Space, 2. Peace and War, 3. Young and Old, 4. Danger and Response, and 5. Religion, Language, and Health.Positives:1.	Always expect high-quality work from Dr. Diamond. Lucid, accessible writing, and superb research.2.	A fascinating topic, a look at traditional societies and what we can learn from them.3.	Excellent format. The book is grouped logically and he prepares the readers on what to expect of each chapter.4.	Explains how traditional societies divide space and its implications. It helps set the stage for understanding the topics of the rest of this book. “All those restrictions on free movement cause members of small-scale societies to divide people into three categories: friends, enemies, and strangers.” 5.	Explains how traditional societies handle disputes. Recounts a tragic story that illustrates how traditional New Guinea people can deal peacefully with a loss suffered at the hands of others. He also provides peaceful dispute resolution in five different non-state societies. 6.	There is wisdom to be found in traditional societies. “Reestablishing relationships counts for everything in traditional New Guinea, and establishing guilt or negligence or punishment according to Western concepts is not the main issue.”7.	Throughout the book Diamond shows differences between traditional societies and modern ones. “Even children’s games in the U.S. commonly are contests of winning and losing. That isn’t so in traditional New Guinea society, where children’s play involves cooperation rather than winning and losing.”8.	Interesting look at justice. “American society instead emphasizes individual responsibility over collective responsibility.” “Deterrence is an explicit goal of our criminal justice system.” “State criminal justice systems exist primarily to promote goals of the state: to reduce private violence, to foster obedience to the state’s laws, to protect the public as a whole, to rehabilitate criminals, and to punish and deter crimes.”9.	A look at traditional warfare by describing an admittedly tiny war among the Dani people of the western New Guinea Highlands. “Many features of Dani warfare that turn out to be shared with wars in many other traditional societies.”10.	A look at war and what it really is. The similarities and differences between traditional and modern societies. “One of the two biggest differences between traditional and state warfare involves the distinction between total war and limited war.” A paragraph worth noting: “I sympathize with scholars outraged by the mistreatment of indigenous peoples. But denying the reality of traditional warfare because of political misuse of its reality is a bad strategy, for the same reason that denying any other reality for any other laudable political goal is a bad strategy. The reason not to mistreat indigenous people is not that they are falsely accused of being warlike, but that it’s unjust to mistreat them. The facts about traditional warfare, just like the facts about any other controversial phenomenon that can be observed and studied, are likely eventually to come out. When they do come out, if scholars have been denying traditional warfare’s reality for laudable political reasons, the discovery of the facts will undermine the laudable political goals. The rights of indigenous people should be asserted on moral grounds, not by making untrue claims susceptible to refutation.” 11.	A look at aggression. “The normal range of aggressive behavior, like the normal range of body height, is influenced by many different genes and by environmental and social factors (like effects of childhood nutrition on adult height).” More wisdom, “It is equally fruitless to debate whether humans are intrinsically violent or else intrinsically cooperative. All human societies practice both violence and cooperation; which trait appears to predominate depends on the circumstances.”12.	An interesting look at childhood. “The hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have fewer valuable possessions that a child could damage than do farmers and herders. Both of those considerations may contribute to hunter-gatherer children enjoying greater freedom to explore.”13.	A fascinating look at the treatment of old people. A revelation, “Among the Kaulong people of southwestern New Britain, strangling of a widow by her brothers or son immediately after her husband’s death was routine until the 1950s.” “Looming behind this increasing social isolation of the modern elderly is that they are perceived as less useful than were old people in the past, for three reasons: modern literacy, formal education, and rapid technological change.”14.	Explains how traditional societies respond to dangers. He discusses the four main groups of dangers. “How do traditional peoples respond to dangers? I shall discuss what seem to me to be the four main groups of dangers faced by traditional peoples: environmental hazards, human violence, infectious and parasitic diseases, and starvation.” Great stuff.15.	A fascinating look at religion. So many profound questions asked in this section. “We tend to associate religion with humanity’s noble side, not with its evil side: why, then, does religion sometimes preach murder and suicide?”16.	The components of religion. “The components commonly attributed to religions fall into five sets: belief in the supernatural, shared membership in a social movement, costly and visible proofs of commitment, practical rules for one’s behavior (i.e., “morality”), and belief that supernatural beings and forces can be induced (e.g., by prayer) to intervene in worldly life.” “In short, what we now term religion may have arisen as a by-product of the human brain’s increasing sophistication at identifying causal explanations and at making predictions.”17.	An interesting look at languages. “The four closest ecological correlations of language diversity are with latitude, climate variability, biological productivity, and local ecological diversity.” In defense of languages.18.	A look at non-communicable diseases. A look at hypertension, diabetes and its causes. The impact on traditional societies. 19.	The epilogue ties a neat ribbon around the topics presented in the book.20.	A helpful further reading section.Negatives:1.	At over 500 pages it requires an investment of your time. The book could have been condensed to a hundred fewer pages without losing its essence.2.	Overemphasis on his experiences in New Guinea. The good doctor keeps going back to his comfort zone almost to a fault.3.	There is redundancy and verbosity. 4.	It’s hard to be fair to Dr. Diamond and expect this book to be the grand revelation that was “Guns, Germs, and Steel”. It’s a very solid book but it’s not the seminal book the GGS was. This is more like a very good academic study versus the masterpiece of GSS.5.	I’m skeptical a big claims such as the degree of violence between societies.6.	The book feels uneven. It’s almost as if some chapters were written as separate essays that were added later on. In summary, Jarod Diamond has produced another high-quality effort here. It’s very hard to live up to the grand expectations of “Guns, Germs, and Steel”, on its own this is a very solid and informative and yes ambitious book. It’s amazing how Diamond is able to converge his knowledge in anthropology, sociology, evolutionary biology, and even nutrition into the mix and does so successfully. I highly recommend this book with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel” and “Collapse” by Jared Diamond, “The Better Angels of our Nature” and “Language, Cognition, and Human Nature” by Steven Pinker, “The Unfolding of Language” by Guy Deutscher, “Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World” by Jack Weatherford, and “Salt: A World History” by Mark Kurlansky."
39,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21478808-sam,4,"Jared Diamond argues that the wisdom of traditional societies's (nonindustrial societies) customs offer valuable insights into alternative resolutions of social issues for industrial and postindustrial societies. Using personal research anecdotes and other published scholarly social science research, the author synthesizes social science research to model case studies of how different cultures resolve different social issues, including conflict resolution, elderly care, childraising, multilingualism, and diet. As a broad survey of personal experience and research, this approach favors the author's observations over the referenced cultures's observations, which some readers may criticize for not including other perspectives. This work also includes reference to unilineal cultural evolution theory which some readers might criticize for (intentionally or unintentionally) promoting an invalidated social science theory of the 1800s. This book is valuable as an advanced introduction to cross-cultural research and thinking. Potential readers of this book might include first-year college students, public science readers, and those interested in traditional societies of Africa and the Pacific Islands; although, the breadth of material might be overwhelming for some readers. This work might have been easier to read, for wider readership, if it were written as a chronological memoir of ""lessons learned"" during decades of research in New Guinea, rather than as a scholarly tome--as thoughtful as the arguments and book's organization are in their current form."
40,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,3,"Basically an analysis of aspects within hunter/gatherer societies and the comparison with our own Western ones. There were some very interesting sections discussed, such as widow strangling, awareness of dangers, and infanticides. While he did delve into religion and dietary differences, these topics diverged from the way he talked about the other aspects and I felt he veered off of primarily describing what other societies do and got a little preachy.Some takeaways are that almost anything can be made to be socially acceptable, even strangling your own mother. Knowing what kills people is important. Hunter/gatherer societies tend to have that figured out. Trees (falling out of them and them falling on you) and other tribes. In modern society we seem to be terrible at statistics. We worry about plane crashes while ignoring car crashes and heart disease.My favorite quotes:Life in Africa is materially poor and socially emotionally rich. While U.S. life is materially rich and socially emotionally poor.Like women, pigs are prone to wander and desert their owners, are easily stolen, and thus provoke endless disputes."

He especially focuses on New Guinea for his comparisons. He compares legal systems, war, childcare, relationships to the elderly, perception of dangers, religion, number and uses of languages, and diet. I found the childcare part particularly interesting, but since it mostly focuses on babies and young children, the information is mostly superfluous to me now because my kids are older. I think the book is pretty entertaining, and sometimes thought-provoking, but not especially educational."

44,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The World Until Yesterday’ is an impressive synthesis of Diamond’s experiences and research into traditional modes of life, especially those practised in New Guinea. It is a measured, thoughtful, and well-structured book, highly readable and thought-provoking. Diamond begins by making a point that often bothers me - the perceived universality of conclusions from research on WEIRD (Western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) societies. This is especially irritating in psychology and behavioural economics, in which experiments on conveniently available students are treated as representative of all humanity’s behaviour. Surely not. This book aims to explain a range of experiments in living undertaken by people subsisting in small groups around the world, providing insight into how our ancestors lived and how urbanisation and industrialisation impact on societies.The scope of the book is thus very wide, but Diamond is careful to avoid undue generalisation and to support his statements with what quantitative and qualitative evidence is available. I was especially interested by the chapter about war, which explained how a cycle of revenge may take over when there is no higher state authority to prevent it. Conversely, I found the chapter on religion a little disappointing, as it discussed the reasons for religion to exist without giving many details of how religious practises differ across traditional societies. I suppose that topic in itself merits a huge pile of books. The chapter on languages intrigued me considerably. The density of linguistic variation within New Guinea is such that people living in traditional societies there speak five to ten different languages, some as many as fifteen! The majority of these and other traditional languages are at risk of dying out, however, as the hegemony of the nine most popular (Mandarin, Spanish, English, etc) advances. The book explains why this loss would be a significant one, as well as recounting the advantages of being multilingual. This was preaching to the choir as far as I’m concerned, but I gather in America it is much rarer to be taught additional languages at school or indeed at home. Indeed, it seems that being bilingual is discouraged in the US on grounds of cultural assimilation. That seems tragic to me, as studying other languages is fascinating and very useful. As well as promoting linguistic variety, the book draws other lessons from the ways of life followed by hunter gatherers and other traditional societies. Diamond repeatedly cautions against romanticising such societies, as the fact is that their lifestyles are dangerous and subsistence-level, involving life expectancies below those in the developed world. (On the other hand, it is also noted that the shift from hunter gatherer to agricultural modes of life in past millennia involved a fall in average life expectancy, as did the initial rapid urbanisation of the Industrial Revolution. Factory workers in 19th century British cities had shockingly low life expectancies and appalling levels of infant mortality.) Nonetheless, Diamond demonstrates that there are lessons to be taken from traditional ways of life, which if nothing else demonstrate a diversity that is generally ignored in the West. Approaches to child-rearing, looking after the elderly, and health are covered, as is attitude to risk. To my mind, though, the former three areas of discussion were rather lacking the obvious explanation for problematic Western practises: neoliberal capitalism. The suggestions that Diamond makes for better child-rearing, for example, mainly involve spending less money on and more time with infants. In terms of health, the non-communicable diseases he recounts are all diseases of (relative) affluence, part of a lifestyle heavily advertised in the West involving processed food, alcohol, cigarettes, and car dependence. The discussion of risk assessment is striking as Diamond comments that inaccurate estimations of risk in the Western world appear influenced by the media, whereas traditional societies estimate risks from their own experience and constant discussion with their peers. Thus in the Western world we have inflated fears of big disasters like nuclear meltdowns, whilst taking a relaxed attitude to the exponentially higher daily risk of car accidents. Awareness of this does not necessarily lend itself to obvious methods for improving realism about risks, but is interesting nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed this book and found its conclusions convincing, albeit a little naive. It’s all very well to place responsibility on individuals to eat more healthily and avoid diabetes, but that ignores structural problems with the sugar-peddling global food industry. Still, the aim of the book is not to provide fixes for Western problems so much as reflect on life in traditional societies. I certainly feel more well-informed on that front for reading it."
45,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3276408-chantelle,4,"The first 150 pages are dense and slow and hard to get through. I put it aside and despaired that I would ever finish it. Meanwhile I read a different Jared Diamond book, The Third Chimpanzee. After finishing that book I was able to come back to this one and quickly finish it. The first section on social justice seem to me abstract and dry. However, after getting over that hump the other sections are much more interesting and relevant. Jared Diamond has a unique approach to viewing the world that comes from his extensive scientific, linguistic, geographic, biological, and historical specialties. All of these different views allow him to combine his perspective into a unique way of viewing the world, both ancient and modern."
46,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1731016-jeremy,2,"A little long, tedious in places, but overall a good, balanced take on what we can learn from traditional societies (mostly hunter-gatherers but also farming and herding groups). If you want the whole book in one quote, here it is:“Traditional societies in effect represent thousands of natural experiments in how to construct a human society. They have come up with thousands of solutions to human problems, solutions different from those adopted by our own WEIRD modern societies. We shall see that some of those solutions—for instance, some of the ways in which traditional societies raise their children, treat their elderly, remain healthy, talk, spend their leisure time, and settle disputes—may strike you, as they do me, as superior to normal practices in the First World. Perhaps we could benefit by selectively adopting some of those traditional practices. Some of us already do so, with demonstrated benefits to our health and happiness. In some respects we moderns are misfits; our bodies and our practices now face conditions different from those under which they evolved, and to which they became adapted. But we should also not go to the opposite extreme of romanticizing the past and longing for simpler times. Many traditional practices are ones that we can consider ourselves blessed to have discarded—such as infanticide, abandoning or killing elderly people, facing periodic risk of starvation, being at heightened risk from environmental dangers and infectious diseases, often seeing one’s children die, and living in constant fear of being attacked. Traditional societies may not only suggest to us some better living practices, but may also help us appreciate some advantages of our own society that we take for granted.”Big Ideas:+ Elman Service’s division of human societies into four categories of increasing population size, political centralization, and social stratification:BandTribeChiefdomState + State governments are a result of community size and only arose after the agricultural revolution- “No hunter-gatherer society has ever been able to feed a sufficiently dense population to support a state government”- “That need for police and laws and moral commandments to be nice to strangers doesn’t arise in tiny societies, in which everyone knows everyone else”+ Not even state governments can eliminate inequality- “All idealistic efforts to minimize inequality within states—e.g., Karl Marx’s formulation of the communist ideal ‘From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs’—have failed”- “Social stratification increases, from the relative egalitarianism of small hunter-gatherer groups to the inequality between people in large centralized societies”+ Environmental differences explain why some societies developed differently and industrialized more rapidly than others- “A formerly prevalent belief, still held by many individuals today, is that those regionally different outcomes reflect innate differences in human intelligence, biological modernity, and work ethic. Supposedly, according to that belief, Europeans are more intelligent, biologically advanced, and hard-working, while Aboriginal Australians and New Guineans and other modern band and tribal peoples are less intelligent, more primitive, and less ambitious. However, there is no evidence of those postulated biological differences, except for the circular reasoning that modern band and tribal peoples did continue to use more primitive technologies, political organizations, and subsistence modes and were therefore assumed to be biologically more primitive”- “The explanation for the differences in types of societies coexisting in the modern world depends on environmental differences. Increases in political centralization and social stratification were driven by increases in human population densities, driven in turn by the rise and intensification of food production (agriculture and herding). But surprisingly few wild plant and animal species are suitable for domestication to become crops and livestock. Those few wild species were concentrated in only about a dozen small areas of the world, whose human societies consequently enjoyed a decisive head start in developing food production, food surpluses, expanding populations, advanced technology, and state government. As I discussed in detail in my earlier book Guns, Germs, and Steel, those differences explain why Europeans, living near the world region (the Fertile Crescent) with the most valuable domesticable wild plant and animal species, ended up expanding over the world, while the !Kung and Aboriginal Australians did not”+ Environmental circumstances also explain different rates of violence- “It could not be claimed that some societies are inherently or genetically peaceful, while others are inherently warlike. Instead, it appears that societies do or don’t resort to war, depending on whether it might be profitable for them to initiate war and/or necessary for them to defend themselves against wars initiated by others… It is equally fruitless to debate whether humans are intrinsically violent or else intrinsically cooperative. All human societies practise both violence and cooperation; which trait appears to predominate depends on the circumstances… Slavery was practised on a large scale by many or perhaps most state societies, including ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, China, the Ottoman Empire, and European colonies in the New World”+ Traditional views of other humans- “Traditional peoples tend to view other people as split into three types: known individuals who are friends, other known individuals who are enemies, and unknown strangers who must be considered as likely enemies”- “Missionaries usually adopt the precaution of sending an emissary from a contacted neighboring group to ask whether a missionary would be welcomed, rather than expose themselves to the danger of walking in unannounced”- “First contact with previously uncontacted tribal peoples is terrifying. Neither side knows what the other side wants or will do. It is difficult or impossible to communicate peaceful intent by sign language to previously uncontacted people whose language one does not know, even if they wait long enough to let you try to communicate. The risk is that they won’t wait; they may be terrified or furious, panic, and immediately start shooting with bows and arrows”+ Problems in modern society- Disease: “Most of us citizens of modern states will die of non-communicable diseases—diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, various cancers, and others—that are rare or unknown among traditional peoples, who nevertheless often proceed to acquire these diseases within a decade or two of adopting a Westernized lifestyle. Evidently, something about the Westernized lifestyle brings on these diseases, and we could minimize our risk of dying of these commonest causes… The crowd diseases could not have existed before the origins of agriculture around 11,000 years ago. Only with the explosive population growth made possible by agriculture did human populations reach the high numbers required to sustain our crowd diseases.”- Food and sex: “The significance of sex and food is reversed between the Siriono and us Westerners: the Sirionos’ strongest anxieties are about food, they have sex virtually whenever they want, and sex compensates for food hunger, while our strongest anxieties are about sex, we have food virtually whenever we want, and eating compensates for sexual frustration”- Rough transition through agriculture: “Archaeological and ethnographic evidence shows that life really did become harder as hunter-gatherers became farmers and assembled in larger societies. With the transition to agriculture, the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened”- Decreasing diversity: “Languages are disappearing so rapidly (about one every nine days), and there are so few linguists studying them, that time is running out even to describe and record most languages before they disappear”- Etc: “Other frequent observations are the greater time pressures, scheduling constraints, stress levels, and competitiveness in Western societies than in traditional societies”+ Benefits of modern society- Less lethal war: “Average values for modern states are about one-tenth of average traditional values. It may astonish you readers, as it initially astonished me, to learn that trench warfare, machine guns, napalm, atomic bombs, artillery, and submarine torpedoes produce time-averaged war-related death tolls so much lower than those from spears, arrows, and clubs… State warfare is an intermittent exceptional condition, while tribal warfare is virtually continuous… In state warfare soldiers who surrender or are captured are normally permitted to survive, whereas in traditional warfare all are routinely killed… The biggest advantage of state government: the bringing of peace”- “We Westerners, despite having traded our set of traditional human illnesses for a new set of modern illnesses, enjoy on the average better health and longer lives”+ Religion serves several functions in society- Social cohesion: “if you insist, despite all evidence to the contrary, that he was born of a virgin birth, and nobody has been able to shake you of that irrational belief after many decades of your life, then your fellow believers will feel much more confident that you’ll persist in your belief and can be trusted not to abandon your group”- A way to understand the world- Comfort in times of distress+ Evolved traits that seem like too great a leap may have served intermediate functions along the way- Ex: Electric eels may have evolved their shocks as a form of communication and eventually the shocks became powerful enough to stun prey, conferring a further evolutionary advantage + Things we can learn from traditional societies- More frequent nursing of infants could reduce the chance of conception while nursing: “Sexually active nursing mothers in modern Western industrial societies, unlike their hunter-gatherer counterparts, may still conceive (to their surprise) for either or both of two reasons: their nursing frequency is much too low for hormonally induced lactational amenorrhea; and they are sufficiently well nourished that their body fat levels remain above the critical threshold for ovulation, even despite the caloric expenditure of lactation”- Co-sleeping is not as detrimental as some think: “Virtually all infants in human history until the last few thousand years did sleep in the same bed with the mother and usually also with the father, without widespread reports of the dire consequences feared by pediatricians. That may be because hunter-gatherers sleep on the hard ground or on hard mats; a parent is more likely to roll over onto an infant in our modern soft beds”- How we carry infants can affect their development: “The constant contact even when the caretaker is walking, the constant sharing of the caregiver’s field of view, and transport in the vertical position may contribute to !Kung infants being advanced (compared to American infants) in some aspects of their neuromotor development”- Other child-care ideas: “A period of on-demand nursing insofar as it’s practical, late weaning, maintaining physical contact between the infant and some adult, co-sleeping (get a firm mattress or a crib in your bedroom, and discuss it with your pediatrician!), transporting infants vertically and facing forwards, much allo-parenting, responding quickly to a child’s crying, avoiding physical punishment, giving your child freedom to explore (appropriately monitored!), multi-age playgroups (valuable for both the younger and the older children), and helping your kids learn to entertain themselves rather than stifling them with manufactured ‘educational toys’ and video games and other pre-packaged entertainment”- Become more constructively paranoid about things that are truly risky, like driving a car: “If there is some act that carries a low risk each time, but if you’re going to do it frequently, you had better learn to be consistently careful if you don’t want to die or become crippled at a young age”- We should value social relationships: “Loneliness is not a problem in traditional societies”- Raise our children bilingually or multilingually- Incorporate more restorative justice and mediationPotent Quotables:Being in New Guinea is like seeing the world briefly in vivid colors, when by comparison the world elsewhere is gray.* The societies to which most readers of this book belong represent a narrow slice of human cultural diversity. Societies from that slice achieved world dominance not because of a general superiority, but for specific reasons: their technological, political, and military advantages derived from their early origins of agriculture, due in turn to their productive local wild domesticable plant and animal species. Despite those particular advantages, modern industrial societies didn’t also develop superior approaches to raising children, treating the elderly, settling disputes, avoiding non-communicable diseases, and other societal problems. Thousands of traditional societies developed a wide array of different approaches to those problems."

He means something more like the hunter-gatherers of New Guinea or the Amazon, or the !Kung (don't ask me how that's pronounced) of sub-saharan Africa. While they are almost certainly not identical in their lifestyle or culture to their (and our) ancestors of 10,000 years ago, there's also no question theirs is a more time-tested way of life than what we have in the wealthiest countries (U.S., western Europe, Japan, etc.).The first thing Diamond is at pains to do, after explaining just what he means by ""traditional"", and just how very different their way of life is from ours, is to point out a few of the reasons why we can be glad we weren't born into their culture instead of ours. His principal example is the rate of violent death. Here, he cites some of the same evidence as Steven Pinker in ""Better Angels of Our Nature"", although given his background Diamond is able to add to the survey of the studies of others, his own personal experience of several decades doing field work in New Guinea. For example, the rate of war-related death in Germany and Russia during the 20th century (among the highest of any nations in modern times) are about 1/3rd the AVERAGE for traditional small-scale societies (averaged over similarly long periods of time). Because their populations are small, their wars are small, but the chance of dying a violent death at a young age is far, far greater.Having thus explained that we shouldn't be considering trading in our office cube and modern clothes for a loincloth in the rain forest, he goes on to ask a more nuanced question. Given that we have gotten a few big things right in technological societies (lower rates of violence, better health care for infectious disease or accidental injury), is there anything not quite as big and important that we do worse at? In other words, what could we be learning from them?Without attempting to summarize his arguments on each point, I'll just list the topics he covers in some depth:1) our attitude towards dangers to be feared (real or imagined)2) how children are raised3) what role we assign to old people4) diet5) physical exercise (most of us could have guessed at this one ourselves)In each case, Diamond tries to correct his New Guinea-centric personal knowledge with a variety of other sources from many different societies. Not all small-scale traditional societies are the same, of course. For example, most of them may have a more engaging and productive role for their old people than we do, but there are some where old people are left to die or even killed. But if there is a distribution, from revered to discarded, that human societies lie along in their treatment of old people, Diamond thinks modern western societies lie closer to the ""discarded"" end of the spectrum. Perhaps he has a little different thinking on this point than when he was thirty years younger?So, having read Diamond's latest weighty tome, it is time to ask, is it any good? Well, I can't judge the accuracy, having never spent any time among hunter-gatherers or other small-scale traditional societies; Diamond certainly has a plethora of other researchers' work cited in the course of his survey.What I can say, though, is that he does a good job of using non-Westernized lifestyles as a way of throwing a spotlight on our own. Whether or not you agree with his opinions on how child-rearing ought to be different, I think it's indisputable that he gives us a useful perspective from which to think about it. The same is true for just about every other topic he addresses.I think it is not too controversial to say that the westernized lifestyle could use some improving (see diabetes, lung cancer, obesity, hypertension). Most of the time, when people discuss how things could or should be different, they are using mostly only their imagination (or that of others whose opinions they have read) to say what could or should be changed. Unlike 50 years ago, though, we now have a wealth of information from anthropologists and others about what has worked (and not worked), and how and sometimes why, in other societies made of real people, not some imaginary ideal of what people are like. Diamond's book, and the ideas in it, shouldn't be accepted uncritically. But the question in the subtitle is a good one, and Diamond's attempt at an answer is an enjoyable first survey of what the answers might be."
48,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22264988-tjacksonrichards,3,"A really phenomenal premise executed with Diamond's generous explanatory gifts, tho unfortunately he neglects a number of seemingly crucial topics of comparison between state and non-state societies (economic disparity resolution; resolving ethnic, gender and mental-health diversity; etc). In place of these more pressing concerns, Diamond offers fluffy chapters about 'Danger and Response' and an insightful but again overstuffed section about the treatment of elderly which is only slightly less boring than his TED talk presentation of said chapter: https://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamo..."
49,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2070884-self-propelled,3,"I had a mixed response to this. Two of Diamond's earlier books ('The Third Chimpanzee' and 'Guns, Germs and Steel') are two of my favourite books for their fascinating sense of intellectual adventure. Reading them years ago, I had that rare sense of coming to understand more of how the world really works. This work is not nearly so revelatory, and far more flawed.First though, the positive: Diamond's central point is an extremely important one: that we should not assume that our Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) modes of living are the only ones available; nor are they necessarily the best. He suggests we look to traditional societies in order to broaden our horizons, and the best of the book are his often gripping first-hand accounts of life among such societies on the island of New Guinea, which are supplemented by anthropological accounts from elsewhere.Too often though, the conclusions to be drawn from these vignettes are commonplace: eat less and exercise more; don't abandon your parents; it's probably good to be bi- or multilingual; religion evolved to fulfil various social functions; and so on. The sections on restorative justice and childrearing are more interesting for their practical suggestions. There are absorbing digressions in each chapter, but these are sometimes lost amongst Diamond's efforts to categorise and catalogue all the vast reams of data he's devoured in writing the book, much of which might have been relegated to appendixes or edited into a tighter form. Strangely, Diamond omits any mention of a central feature of traditional life: that of depending on the natural world, living amongst it, and building one's culture around it. Nowhere does he suggest that we might learn something from traditional societies' reverence for and understanding of their own environment.Far more troubling, though, is Diamond's characterisation of the process whereby traditional societies come to be part of modern states:""traditional people so willingly abandon their jungle lifestyle, admired in the abstract by Westerners, who don’t have to live that lifestyle themselves. For instance, those differences help explain why so many Ache Indians give up the freedom of their lives as forest hunters and settle on reservations, degrading as that may seem to outsiders. Similarly, an American friend of mine traveled halfway around the world to meet a recently discovered band of New Guinea forest hunter-gatherers, only to discover that half of them had already chosen to move to an Indonesian village and put on T-shirts, because life there was safer and more comfortable. “Rice to eat, and no more mosquitoes!” was their short explanation.""A true anecdote, no doubt, but is this an accurate generalisation? To my mind, it comes perilously close to the justifications given by government officials down the years in justifying the kinds of brutal policies often imposed by states on indigenous peoples: forced settlements, land-grabs and marginalization, even murder and explicit attempts at extermination. Any account of life in New Guinea ought to at least mention the tens of thousands murdered following Indonesia's annexation of the western half of the island in 1963, but Diamond does not; nor does he dwell on the countless other examples of this sort, from the Amazon to Alaska.Like Steven Pinker, he appears to think that violence against other groups is a predominantly tribal phenomenon, and that the supposed violent tendencies of traditional societies are best eliminated by assimilation into modern states. This is the classic enlightenment journey from the Hobbesian state of nature to the enlightened constitutional state: a post-hoc rationalisation that works backwards from the privileged position we WEIRD citizens currently enjoy, but that fails to reflect actual historical experience.There is much to enjoy in Diamond's book if one ignores his position in this respect, and it is obvious that he has a very great deal of respect and admiration for traditional societies both in the abstract and in person. That said, it remains troubling that in a book so preoccupied with the lessons 'we' can learn from traditional societies, any lesson about how 'we' might treat 'them' is not even considered."
50,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Jared Diamond’s The World Before Yesterday is Ok. Diamond struck gold with Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Editionwhich was better than his Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies] but here he has lost his mojo.The World Before Yesterday may pass as a backup read to go with a better undergraduate text in a real anthropology class or as a discussion starter for non-anthropologists but otherwise I am not sure who is the best audience for this book. Diamond makes a few good points, especially towards the end when he discusses how we in the modern or as he phases it the WIERD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) world might improve our diet to avoid modern world non-contagious diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Otherwise this is a collection of more or less well documented observations about how he thinks human society used to work before the centralized state.It is good to know that in the WEIRD world we are less likely to kill each other, no matter how industrialized and deadly modern warfare has become. Then again he was writing without considering the new cycles of killing in modern killing growing from the asymmetric warfare based on revenge killing motivated by religious hatreds. A failing in this regard is a failing to redo some of his observations by cross tabbing analysis between societies given to ancient cycles of warfare and ancient attitudes towards strangers and traders.A personal measure of my reaction to Yesterday is the fact that I had originally read it when it was first published about 5 years ago. I hat entirely forgotten reading it and was well into re reading it when I remembered anything from the first read. That is it is mostly a forgettable book.His advice about adopting the Paleolithic diet or the Mediterranean diet or at least the Italian habit of eating slowly may still have the support of qualified medical opinion, but as a taint of food fad about it. Certainly it is no long out of the box thinking that in the modern diet we eat too much sugar and too much processed food. Though in the case of processed food, we may just need a better set of definitions. In the case of so called organic food, a term Diamond wisely avoids, one cannot be certain what it means other than expensive.Against the criticism from the world of anthropology that Diamond gives too much weight to differences in climate. Diamond’s argument reads like the same economics argued by the folks behind Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. Look at the win loss analysis for a given type of cultural response and that is how that culture will develop, Diamond argues the math behind the cultivation of widely separate plots of land against eh obvious efficiency of working one large plot. The inefficient scattered plots pay off better in the case of crop failure and so that strategy wins.I do not dislike The World Before Yesterday, much of Diamonds thoughts are well argued. Mostly it lacks the clarity of purpose in the two earlier works. For all of its deliberate organization and systematic class room lecture style, it rambles and seems to be at cross purposes. Pre-state subsistence societies do have something to teach modern societies. Humans can learn from predator animals and flowering plants and the stars in the sky and from almost anything. I am not sure I can recommend all of those implied books or get too excited about this one."
51,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,2,"Interesting but long-winded. Probably could be half the length and I would have learnt the same amount.______Bureaucrats are necessary to administer states once their size grows beyond that at which everyone can know everyone else (a couple hundred)In modern societies with a vast array of choices and more frequent geographical moves, give us more scope (and need) for relationships based on personal bonds of friendship rather than kinship or marriage or the geographical accident of proximity in childhood. It is also perfectly normal for strangers to meet each other without ill intent or consequence.The overriding goal of state justice is to provide a mandatory alternative to DIY justice. Failure to do so invites retaliation to violence which locks societies or groups into cycles of revenge-based violence.All state governments have a long-term aim of decreasing violence, because it interferes with the administration of the region.All human societies practice violence and cooperation, whichever dominates depends on circumstances.Small scale societies offer a vast library of experiments on child-rearing practices in a natural environment.Rich allo-parental (i.e. non-parental adult) relationships seem to be linked with increased social skills.Multi-age playgroups allow the older children to learn how to care for younger children, while the younger children are socialised by their older peers.The degree to which physical punishment is used on children seems to coincide with the degree of harm that may result from a child's misbehaviour.Older people in traditional societies serve as repositories of accumulated knowledge (e.g. what foods are edible in the event of a natural disaster wiping out the harvest)Many tribal cultures don't consider individual privacy a primary concern.If older people keep working, they prevent the younger generations from getting jobs, if they retire they increase the financial burden on the same generations.Grandparents make ideal babysitters because they are invested in raising their offspring's offspring and are able to give their undivided attention to raising the child. The main caveat is that with couples waiting till their 30s to have children, their parents might lack the physical stamina to keep up with the children.Useful attributes that tend to increase with age include understanding of people and relationships, ability to help other people without ego getting in the way, and powers of synthetic interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex problems.On constructive paranoia: If there is some act that carries a low risk each time, but if you're going to do it frequently, you had better learn to be consistently careful if you don't want to die or become crippled at a young age.Choose to ensure yields never drop below a critical (starvation for farmers) level rather than aim for maximum time-averaged returns if you're actually living off those yields (like farmers).Language serves as a badge of identity in a multi-group region. People who speak your language are your people. (especially in a foreign land)Anonymity means the freedom to step away from the social bonds that make life in New Guinea emotionally full, but also confining. It includes the freedom to be alone, to walk alone, to have privacy, to express oneself, to debate openly, to hold unconventional views, to be more immune to peer pressures, and to not have one's every action scrutinised and discussed."
52,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8542948-ben-lever,3,"The World Until Yesterday is ostensibly an attempt to provide some insight into how we can improve our own societies by looking at more traditional societies - societies like those in the highlands of New Guinea, some of which still live essentially as they did millennia ago. Diamond covers war, child-rearing, old age, everyday dangers, religion, language and health, but he seems to be using these more as jumping-off points for his stories than the other way around.Diamond has an incredible wealth of knowledge to share, having studied a wide range of cultures in his long career, and it seems to me like this was more the point of the book. It is, by and large, an excuse to tell the stories of the New Guinean societies Diamond has spent so much of his career with. They are often very engaging stories, but their utility to the problems of our society is, at times, minimal.While Diamond spends less time dealing with the book’s stated purpose than I would like, when he does he is quite insightful - if not always entirely original. For example, he points out the ways in which the traditional New Guinean means of resolving conflicts, by addressing the emotional needs of the participants and by engaging the whole community, is superior to the zealously litigious, slow, and punitive American justice system. He then reveals that many of his suggestions - allowing for arbitration before a dispute reaches court, making the wrongdoer pay legal costs to the victim so as to not favour the rich, and so on - are already being implemented in many Western jurisdictions. The ideas certainly have merit - they have generally proved very successful where they have been implemented - but clearly the link to New Guinean society is one of convenience to Diamond.One thing I do commend Diamond for, though, is being immensely practical about his suggestions. At no point does he seek to diminish the ways in which Western society is superior, nor to sweep the worse parts of traditional societies under the rug, as some scholars would - at all times it is clear that he simply wishes to have the best of both worlds, but is aware that this is easier said than done. He explicitly notes at many stages that the answers to Western society’s problems would not be solved by abandoning our cities and living traditionally in the forest - it would merely be trading one set of problems for another - but he seeks to cherry-pick the best parts, such that we can have our cake and eat it too.This level of nuance is rare, but characteristic of Diamond, whose earlier book Guns Germs and Steel exemplifies the dispassionate eye of the true cosmopolitan. When you compare The World Until Yesterday with Alain de Botton’s recent book Religion For Atheists, which has similar aims, The World Until Yesterday demonstrates Diamond’s deep understanding of the complexity of both the problems and the solutions - a depth Religion For Atheists simply lacked.While not as good as Guns Germs and Steel, The World Until Yesterday was quite an enjoyable read. It’s worth a look for the stories of traditional societies alone - but for my money, it doesn’t really do what it set out to do, and thus left me a little apathetic."
53,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53484257-sandro-eich,1,"My second book to not finish this year. I was so excited to read this as I generally agree with the prospect that we can generally learn something from traditional societies. Yet the book only made use of long-winded lists that cover common sense knowledge. From someone who teaches geography at a big and well-known university, I would have expected more depth and detail. Especially concerning how different aspects interrelate such as compensation (for damages) and war/peace. "
54,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8194961-max-carmichael,1,"Sigh. Jared Diamond is such a frustrating character. He's a lion of our public discourse, where he monopolizes his broad, sweeping subject matter. But the actual experience and grasp that he brings to the discourse is woefully limited. Like other specialists who've leveraged their original credentials to overstep the boundaries of their expertise - Noam Chomsky, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker - Diamond pedantically and patronizingly makes general, authoritative, and absolute statements about subjects he's only read about at second- or third-hand.Like his other best-selling, prize-winning volumes, this book suffers from the utter lack of a logical, over-arching context or model. Every chapter is a like a different version of the blind man and the elephant; Diamond is a plodding, pedestrian thinker who has no idea how it could all be interrelated. As he taps into various fields outside his personal experience, he tries to adopt the various haphazard cognitive frameworks that have evolved historically within those academic disciplines, but without adequate understanding, and inconsistencies and contradictions accumulate between his themes of territorialism, war, childcare, religion, etc.Diamond's peer-reviewed academic studies have apparently been limited to the inward-looking science of physiology and only secondarily to ecology. His fieldwork has likewise been limited to ornithology and ecology, primarily in New Guinea, which forms the basis for this supposedly definitive survey of worldwide traditional cultures. Diamond just doesn't have the experience to write about his subjects of sociology and anthropology definitively. His opening chapters on territorialism, insularity and warfare have a particularly specious ring, as if he were trying to defend himself from potential criticism by painting traditional societies as uniformly ignorant, paranoid and bloodthirsty. In fact, New Guinea appears to be a very special case of social and cultural evolution, an island with an extremely long history of extreme isolation in which unique forms of dynamic social stability evolved. Diamond provides no archaeological insight into the evolution of these behaviors - he appears to assume they've always been like that - whereas other recent writers have uncovered rich histories of social evolution in traditional societies. Diamond seems drunk on his own celebrity, mistaking his limited experience for universality.The World Until Yesterday begins as another piece of First World propaganda defending unsustainable large-scale societies, on the time-worn basis that they pacify man's savage nature. It ends with the suggestion that there's much more that we ""superior"" civilized folks can appropriate from the traditional people we've already oppressed and exploited on a massive scale. Of all the historical and anthropological surveys I've read, Diamond's book is the least enlightening and the most misleading."
55,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34442147-nuno-r,5,"This is popular science. And as such has its limitations. Jared Diamond has been attacked, even if he seems the least likely candidate for spawning controversy. But, in some issues, he is in good company. Sephen Pinker has also been attacked by defenders of a certain view of native peoples.This issue is even more interesting (to me) than the themes in the books. In this era of disillusion with (modern) civilization we go back to idealized primitivism - like the one Melville gave the world in his travell literature (remember the noble savage idea?). One of the things we do is to internalize an idea of an Eden (which always seems to me very christian and eurocentric) when humans were in harmony with nature and one another. And it's our current civilization that ruined paradise. That makes us condescendent and even infantilizes other cultures, that have a different path or have not fully adopted western civilization. This is probably reinforced by our stereotype of first encounters. We dream of groups of people still ""untouched"" by our corruption. So the ones we idealize we think of them as children of the earth, that we should not contaminate, as dirty adults. This is very preverse.Our hatred of our own shared culture and history (and sometimes even gimples of nihilism and misantropy) prepares the stage for this myth: a period when we (our ancestors) did no wrong. So when scientific ideas talk about (for instance) the extinction of the megaphauna, or how some native peoples drove a certain species to extinction, it does not compute with the noble navage myth. The worse reactions, usually, are when an author talks about the violence in an indigenous culture. Sadly, some defense groups have adopted this view (created by our western colonial condescending culture). And some indigenous survivors (of our actual violence) have added the western version of paradise to their ancient myths. It was the modern human, the modern civilization that ruined all, before there was abundance and peacefull coexistance.This book is probably a response, a long and generous one, to some harsh criticism that Jared Diamond had faced. A warning: it does not fall in the trap of stereotyping primitive cultures as wise and sin free and our culture as corrupt and hopeless. It makes a comparison and tries to understand what drives certain choices and what can both existing cultures truly learn from one another. It's a great book, even if we cannot say it's an academic paper. It's, to oversimplify, an opinion, an educated body of opinions and personal experiences. And a very good reading."
56,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"I'm currently reading Jared Diamond's ""The World Until Yesterday."" Having read other Diamond, and critiques of him, I know that he is somewhat a ""determinist,"" that is, one who gives more weight to outside ""nature"" events rather than inside ""nurture"" ones. However, I think this is overblown, and that he's attacked in part because his academic background isn't cultural anthropology, and also because he's not afraid of saying things like pointing out that cultural anthropologists often get attached to ""their"" tribe, etc., especially re issues such as minimizing tribal level/pre-state violence.Beyond that, Diamond carefully nuances many of his findings. For instance, on treatment of the elderly, he notes that some pre-state societies do better to much better than modern America, some about the same, and some a lot “worse.”I've also had one good takeaway from the book, among several decent ones, and that is just how utilitarian tribal religions are, vs. the more universal ones that didn't arise until after the formation of city-state and nation-state societies. Sometimes, we in the modern West, especially if influenced by one of those nation-state religions, may call certain such utilitarian beliefs, let alone actions, ""bad,"" ... like euthanasia of the elderly ... but Diamond does a good job of pointing out ""it is what it is."" Also, contra his cultural anthropology critics, he does this in a context of individual clans, tribes, chiefdoms, etc.That relates to what I said above about treatment of the elderly. He shows that ethics, as well as religion, of pre-state societies is often highly utilitarian. We might call it “wrong” to abandon the elderly, but, for such societies, the only real choice to abandoning or even euthanizing them is the potential death of multiple other, younger, more productive people.Diamond has a good chapter near the end on trying to define religion in general. He leans on Scott Atran and Pascal Boyer, among others, and while I don’t find his definition perfect, I think it contributes something to the dialogue.Finally, though not his goal in this book, one can read this and see that Diamond shows science still needs philosophy to “inform” it at times.Ideally, I'd 4.5 star this book. But, because of some of the bad press Diamond has gotten, I give it the bump.I also do that because it's a small bit quasi-biographical."
57,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489347-kristin,4,"The scope of this book is insanely huge, covering war, language, religion, child-rearing, and diet, among other topics. For that reason, I was expecting it to be moderately interesting but lacking in a profound unifying theme (such as the type of argument Diamond makes in Guns, Germs, and Steel). I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong: the inarguable theme of this book is one of subverting a black-and-white scheme of looking at human history. This goes two ways, undermining the Hobbesian modern view of progress, in which the lives of pre-state societies are viewed as ""nasty, brutish and short"" as well as the Romantic Rousseauian notion of ""the noble savage"". For the purposes of this book, Diamond views pre-state bands, tribes, and chiefdoms (both ancient and current) as million-year-old evolutionary experiments from which modern states can learn much. Diamond refrains from glorifying or demonizing any of the practices he discusses, always attempting to give contextual reasons (eg. infanticide as a survival mechanism for constantly-moving nomads, or modern bureaucracy as a necessary layer of organization for huge populations). Most of the insights he focuses on are small things that can be adopted individually. A good example is ""constructive paranoia"", a lesson in mitigating common dangers that we can adopt from people who live with a much higher vulnerability to environmental danger. While a New Guinean highlander dwelling in the jungle is paranoid of sleeping under dead trees (a statistically slim chance of danger in one instance, but when multiplied over an entire lifetime adds up to a very real danger), an urban-dwelling citizen of a modern state can apply the same paranoia to cars, or stepladders.This is recommended reading for anyone interested in or followed a ""Paleolithic"" diet. The final chapter offers a lot of evidence in favor of mimicking a traditional hunter-gatherer diet (which varies hugely). But combined with the rest of the chapters, I hope this book will deconstruct the overly-romanticized view of ""Grok"", the hypothetical hunter-gatherer Paleo-poster-boy, who is viewed as the pinnacle of human health and happiness in every way, contentedly wandering the primal forest with washboard abs and perfect teeth. I suggest we learn lessons from history/anthropology without invoking the tired fallacy of a Golden Age. "
58,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Up until a few tens of thousands years ago all humans lived in bands consisting of up to a few dussin people. Thus during almost our entire evolutionary past we lived in an environment very different from the one we live in today. To understand the evolutionary pressures that have shaped our behavior and our cognition we need to look at the way our ancestors lived. This is of course more or less impossible because written history did not appear until very recently. However, there are people alive today, who live in a manner we think is very similar to the way all humans used to live. This book is about these peoples. How do they live and think, what are the similarities and differences between us and them? What can we learn from the way they live?  This book shows that the life of our ancestors was not, as some people (especially Disney employees) like to think, all romantic and in harmony with nature etc. Personally I would never switch my life in a civilized western nation for a life in the jungles of New Guinea, and I think that any informed person would be inclined to make the same choice. The life expectancy is about half of what I have now. They are also much more likely to be murdered because crime rates in such societies is extremely high compared to any state nation. Also they have no Wi-Fi, and that would suck too. In short, life was not better before, it is better now, much better. With that said, there are many lessons to learn from traditional societies and lifestyles. Jared Diamond in “The world until yesterday” goes through many aspects of life, including but not limited to health, crime, diet, child rearing and care for the elderly. Consistently, there are things that we do better in modern western societies and to his credit Diamond points this out. However, there are also lessons to be learned from people living in traditional societies.The justice system is good example. Crimes in traditional societies are dealt with by the community. There are no absolute laws. For example, murder is sometimes seen as justified and therefore not punished. If someone accidentally causes the death of another person then it may be sufficient for the perpetrator to pay sorrow money to the victims family. Western societies on the other hand see crimes as committed against the community and a perpetrator cannot walk away even if the victim forgives him (yes it is usually “hims”). What lessons can we derive from this. It is probably the case that we can learn things from traditional societies about finding common ground between perpetrator and victim. Grudges are usually resolved one way or another. However, in traditional societies it is also much more common that people take justice into their own hands, which can and do have fatal outcomes.In some areas the conclusion that progress have been made is inescapable. One perhaps unexpected example of this is wars. The first time I heard about the relative casualty rates in traditional and modern “total” wars I was rather surprised. I had always thought that the second world war was the worst war in the history of mankind, however, if one compares the casualty rate in the second world war with the casualties in wars between traditional tribes it is actually much higher in the latter. In some traditional wars the casualty rate reaches one percent of the population annually whereas Germany and Russia (the two worst hit nations) saw casualty rates of about 0.16 percent annually during the second world war. In other words, you would be much more likely to die in a “traditional war” than in WW2… One factor here is also the fact that whereas children in western societies are taught that killing is wrong and often feel bad after having killed another person (even in wars), children in traditional societies are sometimes taught to feel pride upon killing an enemy. Taking into account wars as well as violence that occurs between wars, it is crystal clear that we are much better off in our modern world. As Jeff Niehaus, who was teaching developmental psychology at UCSB once said, downtown Chicago is actually really peaceful if you compare it to traditional societies.  I guess that it is clear to the reader that I feel quite fortunate that I live in a modern society and not in the jungles of New Guinea. In a few respects however the sometimes cannibalistic tribes outperform us. One obvious example is language. An average New Guinean knows five languages, which is rather impressive. I personally know only three and I think that is probably better than the average person in modern societies. Diamond argues that we should try and preserve languages which are otherwise bound to go extinct. I was not entirely convinced by his arguments. I accept that bilingualism is associated with performance on other types of tasks, delayed dementia etc, however, I also think that it would be desirable if communication between different peoples of the world was easier. Maybe there is a compromise between extinction of all languages except english (or chinese), and the ability of people to talk to each other (I’ll have to return to that topic).In one of the last chapters Jared Diamond compares the health of people in modern and traditional societies, with mixed conclusions. Once again it is absolutely clear that we live longer in western societies. This ought to be problematic to explain for those who like to claim that a “natural” lifestyle is preferable and more healthy in general. Even though we are using more and more “chemicals” (everythings is chemicals really), we also live longer and longer. If chemicals kill us, then why do we live longer? In some respects our modern lifestyle is not so good however. We do consume too much salt and sugar. Diabetes is pretty much unheard of in some traditional societies, and high blood pressure (which occur if we eat too much salt), is also extremely uncommon. So one lesson we can learn is to eat less sugar and salt.There are many more interesting topics in this book. One that I found particularly interesting was child rearing practices where people in traditional societies spend much more time which their kids and have much more skin to skin contact, an approach I personally do believe in to a certain extent. I also liked the discussion about treatment of the elderly which ranges from leaving them to die when they go dement (this was the practice of Swedish natives), or killing them when they are no longer of any use, to chewing their food for them when they have no teeth (yuk). Overall I liked this book. It was 20 hours well spent although I think Diamond could have excluded certain parts that were personal and not so interesting if you are not extremely interested in Diamonds personal life. However, I did learn a lot that I did not know before and it gave me some new perspectives and it even made me want to change a few things in my own life. Above all however, the book reminded me of the privileged life I live. I live in peace. I have a family that I love (and I am under the impression that they like me too). I have a stimulating job that I like, and I am able to explore the world in a way that would be completely unimaginable to 99.99% of all humans that have existed on this planet. I really did win the lottery in the most important sense. Lucky me =)"
59,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12906585-joshua,2,"This book was a real disappointment. Diamond is capable of some incredibly insightful analyses, however he has failed to use those talents with this book. Rather, and potentially because of the success of GGS & Collapse, The World Until Yesterday is very poorly thought out and uncritically edited. The book makes numerous generalizations about ""traditional societies"" as if they were a homogeneous group. And while he is careful to note, for instance, that humans did not descend from Chimpanzees, but rather that they shared a similar common ancestor, he draws no similar conclusions about human societies - often equating extant traditional societies and inferred ancestral societies.Moreover the diversity of traditional societies that Diamond draws from seems to be quite limited. He has first hand experience with several from PNG gathered from his years of ornithological field work. But just as an anthropologist may not be able to discern the subtile differences between mating behavior in birds, a membrane physiologist and ornithologist is probably not well trained to really characterize the sum of the society within which he was working. The real shame is not that he was not able to gather the necessary information from these people's societies to apply it to this book, rather the real shame is that he doesn't know what he does know is inadequate. A good scientist should know the limitations of their data set and Diamond grotesquely mischaracterizes indigenous PNG society based on his limited exposure. I'm not saying I could do better after my time doing field work in Fiji, however I know that I couldn't do better. That's the point I'm making. This book would never fly in a peer-review environment, and I feel like Diamond's powerful personality kept the editors from really gutting the sections that they should have. I did not finish reading this book, so there may be pearls in the later chapters, but from what I had read I realized the opportunity costs were too great to hear him finish."

Rubber was valuable to make slingshots. For a long time, I shared pieces of my valuable red inner tube with other kids for them to make slingshots. But in the U.S., if you acquire something valuable, you keep it for yourself and you don't share it. In addition, nobody in the U.S. would know what to do with an inner tube[/quote]Jared Diamond writes about the world as it has been in the recent (and not so recent past). He spends a great deal of time living among the people of New Guinea, observing, contrasting, comparing the way different cultures of the world do things.The book is broken up into topics, space, peace and war, young and old, danger and response, religion, language and health. Within each topic he investigates many cultures around the world and compares them, for better or worse, with our own.I have welcomed the knowledge in this book, and the way he tries to remain neutral, not romanticising the non-western cultures (as some books often do). The way the New Guineans war with each other is downright scary. I was very interested in the chapters devoted to birth, child rearing, and the care of the elderly. It is wonderful to see both sides of a story. In the birthing community we often dream wistfully of the way birthing used to be (back before obstetricians started taking over), but this book shows that for many cultures birth and child raising has always been full of difficulties. He talks of one night listening to a woman die while giving birth, powerless to help and shocked the tribes people left her alone in her agony.Jared Diamond is 75 years old, a Pulitzer prize winner, and a bestselling author. The man has some strong opinions and the book is full of his opinions and beliefs, though I suspect this was unintentional. Still it was a great incite and I would recommend this book."
61,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2224950-kathryn,5,"I loved reading this non-fiction book, which concerns itself with the differences between those few small-scale traditional societies that still exist in the world and the large-scale Westernized societies that most of us are familiar with (almost by definition, if you can read this review of the book at all, you are conversant with the computer age of today).Dr. Diamond is now a Professor of Geography; but during the 1950′s and 1960′s he was studying ornithology and ecology in New Guinea and other Micronesian islands, and became very well acquainted with the peoples who live in New Guinea and the way in which they lived. Since then he has been back to New Guinea several times, and has observed the differences which exposure to Western society has wrought on the islands. However, most of our history of human psychology is based on subjects who are WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic, which are usually the most available subjects hanging around any Western university campus.The author in this book, using a scale devised by Elman Service, divides human societies into four categories of increasing population size, political centralization, and social stratification: band, tribe, chiefdom, and state. In the book he considers the differences between these four categories in terms of determining who one considers to be a friend, enemy, stranger, or trader, how war is waged, how children are raised, how the elderly are treated, how one responds to danger, and the large questions of religion, language, and preventable health problems.While there are undoubted advantages to being in a modern state (having enough to eat, and having a computer and Internet access, rank highly on my personal list, not to mention having about a dozen bookcases filled to the brim with books), small scale societies can teach us different, if not better, ways to connect to other people and to use our minds much more creatively."
62,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576381-shauni,4,"I rarely buy books brand new, but I bought this one at a book signing after hearing Jared Diamond talk about it. A few weeks later, my son spilled water on it. Just my luck!The book is divided into chapters by topic--territories and trade, peace and war, treatment of young and old, danger and response, religion, language, and health. Rather than romanticizing traditional societies, in each category Diamond points to things that he's glad have gone the way of history, and other things that we might consider reviving in our own individual lives and in society as a whole. I learned a lot from each chapter of the book, but the chapter on religion gave the most pause. I love this (long) quote: Many of us go through difficult periods of life when we re-assess our religious beliefs. At such times, it's worth remembering that our choice of religion is a broader and more complex matter than just adopting metaphysical beliefs that we've decided are true, or rejecting beliefs that we've decided are false [...] The roles [of religion]include the search for satisfying explanations of ultimate questions about the physical world; dealing with anxiety and stressful situations; making sense of the death of a loved one, of the prospect of one's own death and of other painful events; justifying one's moral principles of behavior, and obedience or disobedience to authority; and identifying oneself as a member of a group whose ideals one shares. For those of us going through a period of religious turmoil, perhaps it might help clarify our thinking to remember that religion has meant different things to different societies, and to be honest with ourselves about what religion does or might mean specifically for us.Yet another interesting book from Jared Diamond!"
63,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16862354-dino-go,5,"I've always found Jared Diamond very insightful. I've always agreed with his views. This book, like his previous books, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse"", provides us a huge amount of information to learn about past societes and civilizations. Our present society, with all the available reources available, like technology, make our lives a lot easier to enjoy. Technology continues to make our lives convenient. We've become more productive as a result of technology. One clear or very simple example is to find ourselves sometimes being able to proceed to another meeting while engaged in another phone conference while driving on a busy street. Traditonal societies didn't have the conventience we have today, to watch the news in the comfort and privacy of our own homes. But instead news of past societies were relayed through daily interpersonal conversations. Of course, the reason is clear because they didn't have any other alternatives like we do today. Besides we're way busier than past societies. We have more responsibilities, more recreations and more commitments. But the point is, the evidence is quite clear. Traditional societies keep an eye on each other. They looked after each other. Their conflicts were significantly far less. Conflicts were easier to resolve. Because of their close interpersonal relationships, it was difficult to get angry with each other who knew each other so very well. People who knew each other often found it very hard to get angry with one another. They were much more tolerant and forgiving of each other. Minor infractions were often ignored and regarded only as nuisance. It was better to consume their energy into something that brought them together than apart. "
64,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6130070-natasha-hurley-walker,4,"Fascinating! I always knew we were a little WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) but it was very cool to see just how aberrant our society is compared to the vast majority of humans who have ever lived. It was also very interesting to get some idea of how this came to be, as hunter gathering tribes gave rise to chiefdoms, which gave rise to the first small farming states, and eventually to our enormous nation states. The book is well-structured, focussing on an aspect of society at a time (e.g. diet, religion, danger) and comparing a range of traditional societies with our modern world. I like that at the end he breaks down what we can do as individuals to live healthier, happier lives, based on information from traditional societies (e.g. cut down on salt and sugar), and what would require larger societal transformations (e.g. restorative vs. judgemental justice). I would have liked some personal anecdotes from other societies (especially the Australian Aborigines) because I very much enjoyed Diamond's occasional story of his travels in New Guinea, but I appreciate he needed to stick to what he has actually lived through. I think he just about got the balance right between fact and fun.I want to give this 4.5 stars, as I can't really see how it can be improved. But I reserve 5 stars for books which completely exploded my brain and changed how I see the world (e.g. Guns, Germs and Steel); this certainly deepens my knowledge but (probably just due to reading a lot of other non-fiction) wasn't world-view changing for me."
65,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1893320-ayman-fadel,5,"By comparing how modern and traditional societies handle war, raising of children, care of the elderly, health risks, religion, language and diet, The World Until Yesterday stretches our conception of the ranges of choices available to us in a matter similar to the best science fiction.By learning how other human societies have chosen particular paths and pondering the reasons why they chose them, perhaps we can come to see our own ""givens"" as choices which made sense (i.e. were ""functional."") Once we realize that a time-honored practice in our societies is not in fact universal or intrinsic to being human, we can begin asking whether it continues to fulfill necessary functions or if its continuation brings us harm.The chapter on religion is of particular interest. Professor Diamond identifies seven functions of religion (p. 367). Perhaps an analysis of our practice of religion according to these functions could reveal whether we're placing the proper emphasis on what we as individuals and societies need in a given era. For example, if ""supernatural explanation"" is a function of religion, do we use such explanations in a self-serving, misogynistic or ethnocentric way? Does our practice in religion simply buttress an oligarchical order? Perhaps we could examine our religious practices and emphasize those which work against the more problematic of these functions of religion.Another chapter of interest to many readers of this blog will be the chapter on the development of languages. In brief, the chapter promotes learning multiple languages, but read it to understand why."
66,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"Before this book, I read other works of the author, such as Guns, Germs and Steel, Collapse and The Third Chimpanzee. Of these three, Guns, Germs and Steel made the biggest impression.This book goes back to the core of what the author does: the study of traditional people, preferably as untainted by modern civilization as possible. The author compares the way those people live to our modern society. He picks out both the good and the bad. The author is obviously happy to be living in a society where the chances to be violently killed are reduced to a minimum, where children or the elderly do not have to be murdered and where one does not usually die of infectious diseases.On the other hand, there are a lot things being done right in traditional societies, things we have lost. The intimate way children are raised, how to deal with danger (maintain a 'constructive paranoid' approach), the composition of the diet, the peaceful side of conflict resolution (obviously, there are two sides to this coin, the other one being the path of war) and multi-lingualism and the associated benefits to the quality of their thinking.If nothing else, it is a book that teaches us some humility, not to look down on traditional people, but being able to appreciate the nuggets of wisdom that we could weave into our own lives. A powerful book that brings to live the world the author has explored extensively and loves deeply."
67,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"The latest from the superb Jared Diamond is an overview of the differences between modern society and the way humanity has lived for most of its history - as small, tribal groups. He uses examples of research into the various pre-modern tribes still extant, or recently so, including his own work of fifty years in New Guinea.This is in no way a rosy-eyed critique of modern society, yearning for some mythic past where everything was better; Diamond is too smart and too good a scientist for that. Even when he does hold examples of where tribal peoples have a better system that modern America (his home, so the example he most often uses for the modern world, of course), he gives a wonderfully balanced view. For example, on treatment of the elderly he initially compares the way many tribes value their elders as sources of wisdom with the increasing practice of shuffling American seniors off to care homes with occasional visits, but points out that many 'primitive' societies have been far worse - exposing or banishing or killing members of the tribe when they cost more resources than they produce (a requirement of survival in harsh conditions such as desert or Arctic tundra, without modern technology) - and also that the practice of 'care homes' has arisen due to pressures that are particular to out societies.As always, Diamond writes with an engaging, fluid clarity. The BBC reading was only five quarter-hour readings, so will have just skimmed the surface of his 500-odd page book and came across as not so much an abridgement as a taster. I think I'll have to put an order in at the library to get the full story."
68,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35683-shirley,4,"It's a big task to compare and contrast ""traditional"" societies (societies that are not state run and whose members consist mostly of smaller groups) and the societies that most of us live in now (large, state-run societies). The purview of the book may be huge, but if anyone is up to the job, Jared Diamond is. He draws from his many years of field research in Papua New Guinea, augmenting his personal knowledge with accounts from other traditional societies. Many of Jared Diamond's strengths are on display here: clear writing, a clear roadmap of where the book is going (if you are not up to reading the whole thing, just read the first and last chapters for a good summary), fascinating subjects (comparative anthropology and big topics like law, role of children/elderly, religion, language, war). I enjoyed this book, although perhaps not quite as much as Collapse or especially Guns, Germs, and Steel. There was no provocative hypothesis to be fleshed out, as in GG&S. However, I think Diamond succeeds in his goal, which is a very practical one: to introduce us to some advantages and disadvantages of ""traditional"" societies and to make us consider what aspects of traditional societies we might consider incorporating into our own. (Most of us would not condone infanticide, but we might consider how the elderly might play a more useful role in our societies. We might not rush to give our kids a machete or to play with fire, but we might encourage them to make their toys, instead of buying them all the toys they need.) "
69,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56457-william-shoemaker,3,"Way too long and doesn't stick closely enough to the point of the book (which is telling us what we can learn from traditional societies). Also, a lot of Diamond's key assertions (for example, that traditional societies allow children to play with fire and knives and that's why their children grow up to be more ""independent"" and ""creative"") appear to be based entirely on conjecture and are not in any way science. That's okay; we can still pick and choose from his many points and examples, but it would be nice if Diamond would organize his book so that we could find the important stuff easily without having to sort through a lot of off-topic padding that's not very interesting (i.e. the long-winded and poorly written bullet-point chapter about a few years of warring between two tribes in New Guinea).The most interesting part of the book is the chapter about the biological evolution of religion; it basically tells us how religion evolved and why it exists. I would have been willing to read a lot more about that. Instead, Diamond sees fit to provide dozens of different examples of points that don't really matter--i.e. giving endless examples of traditional societies that, when exposed to the Western lifestyle, quickly developed diabetes and hypertension. I've never read a book in which the author repeats himself so many times; this book would have been a great read if it were a third of its current length. "
70,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18503741-jared,1,"[I listened to the audio book - well, some of it.]Wow, what a let-down. I was really excited to pick up this book, but I became so disenchanted with listening to just a few hours of this audio book that I couldn't take hearing any more. The book started out with so much promise. Diamond started the book by talking about a time when he described the airport on his way to Papua New Guinea. I thought: ""Okay, this should be pretty engaging!""Boy, was I wrong. I have to say that I loved reading 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' and some of other Diamond's books. Those books were very thought-provoking and good reads. This book is by no means a 'Guns, Germs, and Steel'.Diamond can be drone on and on belaboring a simple point ad nauseum, which he is prone to do. He did it in his other books, so I kind of expected it. However, this book took beating a dead horse to a new level. In addition, Diamond's scholarship in the book is sub-par. I audibly laughed out loud when he used Encyclopedia Britanica - yes, the very book that you would expect a 6th grader to use in a book report - to define what 'war' is. At that point, he absolutely lost me.He also uses anecdotal stories and passes them off as evidence of proving a larger point. I was unconvinced.I would not recommend this book to any reader - novice or advanced - since it has very little merit.Wow, disappointing."
71,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/625444-diane,2,"I am fond of Jared Diamond, but this is simply not his best book. He examines how traditional societies do things differently – from waging war to raising babies. I found some of the topics very interesting – raising children and war were two that I enjoyed. One problem with the book for me was the premise that we can learn from traditional societies. I am sure that is true, but in most cases this did not work in the book and the suggestions came across as either obvious or strained. Some of the issues are presented from a personal point of view – for example, he uses a situation where he nearly drowns in a small boat to illustrate the need for caution. The example goes on for pages with nothing really unique about traditional society but more about Diamond himself. The last topic is on health changes in traditional society, specifically obesity and diabetes. This is a topic of interest for me, and I enjoyed much of the material, but I had read most of it before in articles by Diamond in Natural History. This made me wonder if other parts of the book were also reworked from previous articles. (This was an audiobook so there was no accompanying material that would give that information) There was a sense that this was Diamond’s last hurrah – a here-is-everything- I know” sort of book. It is long. I would skip it. Read Collapse instead."
72,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8934711-paola,4,"Most of the readers of this book will belong to WEIRD (Western Educated Industrialised Rich and Democratic) societies, or at any rate industrialised societies. Jared Diamond focuses instead on the myriad of (generally small or very small) traditional, pre-industrialised societies scattered all over the world, trying to distill useful lessons that we may draw to lead our own lives in a more satisfactory and fulfilling way. From justice to raising of children, religion and dealing with all age, Diamond analyses different solutions which he weaves into his final chapters of recommendations for a better life - this indeed is the chapter I find less compelling, a bit too preachy, as anyhow it is clear throughout the book where his heart lies.Nevertheless it is a very interesting book, the writing is discoursive and the narrative interspersed with anecdotes that make for easy reading. As this is a pop-science book aimed at a general audience, there are no footnotes at all - the ""Further reading"" section however does not include references for all of the chapters, which is disappointing. It does contain however some discussion of the problems anthropologists face when studying closed societies with no prior interaction with outsiders, when the interaction itself unavoidably interacts with the phenomenon it is supposed to observe. In short, a book to be read cover to cover."
73,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873780-michael,5,"Diamond's third book takes on the incredibly ambitious topic of the transition from traditional societies to modern societies and the implications of this for subsistance, trade, religion, language, justice mediation, social life and health. He draws on his experiences with the New Guinea highlanders who are impressive as a very large group of traditional peoples that have only encountered the modern world within less than a century... some of whom still remain very isolated from it.Diamond draws on the full wealth of knowledge of traditional societies to flesh out an understanding of our evolutionary and cultural heritage as a human species, having evolved within tradtional societies, by exploring traditional societies practices of political organization, trade, justice mediation and warfare, child rearing, elderly care, approach to dangers, religion, language, and incidence of illnesses (absense of modern illnesses).What we learn in the process of this is at times very suprising. Jared's book both debunks some of our idealized notions of traditional societies, while highlighting some of the important lessons we can learn (as individuals and as a society) from these societies.An absolute treasure trove of valuable insights and entertaining snippets from a lost world. Sometimes a bit academic but still rich and engaging. I enjoyed the audiobook format."
74,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975003-matthew,5,"Fascinating. There is a reason that I salivated when I heard there was a new Jared Diamond book out. If you love non-fiction, you must read several of his books, particularly Guns, Germs and Steel, and Collapse, and now I would add The World Until Yesterday to that list. To the point--this book doesn't contain as completely earth-shattering an hypothesis as GG&S, but it earns high marks for Diamond's first-hand understanding of its subject matter and his ability to relate it to readers who likely have no such thing. Diamond examines many traditional societies--people who live at the hunter-gatherer or subsistence agriculture stage that was the norm until very recently. He compares social, political and medical norms between these societies and ""modern"" societies, presenting a treasure trove of information from academic and historical sources, but, most importantly, from his own time in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, where he has conducted field research over the past 40 years--first as an ornithologist and later as an anthropologist. The world is fortunate that Dr. Diamond discovered his true calling and didn't just limit himself to the birds of New Guinea."
75,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223283-tanya,4,"Jared Diamond is my hero. Okay, that's maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but I so admire his life-long accumulation of knowledge and his ability to synthesize broad data. I always have this sense of mental euphoria when I read his work, like the synapses of my brain are snapping all over as I absorb his historical and anthropological connections. That being said, this book had a slow start for me. I was less interested in reading about war and conflict resolution in traditional societies, and somewhat bored by the analyses of these subjects in the WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) world. But I was fascinated by the sections on child care, status of the elderly, perceptions of danger, and disease. Diamond's insights into diabetes in populations such as the Australian Aborigines and the Pima Indians were particularly eye-opening. I will read anything Diamond publishes (actually, I just checked to see what else he wrote before his blockbuster Guns, Germs and Steel, and I am going to skip on Birds of Northern Melanesia: Speciation, Ecology & Biogeography), and I hope he keeps living, thinking, and writing for a long time to come."
76,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8259351-jim,4,"Jared Diamond writes of adventures experienced by him and a variety of peers in observing how traditional (non-Western) societies address many of life's mundane concerns. Can we learn from the tribe on Papua New Guinea about child care? Even within its culture, parents take different approaches to how to raise children. But traditional societies usually have an expected way of doing things within their tribes. Diamond describes and compares westernized cultures against cultures that have not had the many benefits we enjoy, and life is very rugged and unpredictable for the latter. A nomadic tribe will leave a handicapped elderly person to die without anyone around. Some cultures encourage the elderly to take their own lives rather than be a burden to the tribe. It seems like a pretty cold-hearted way of addressing the issue of death, but for nomadic tribes, they can't be burdened by carrying the feeble, especially when they are fleeing an enemy. Resolving conflicts in traditional societies requires the involvement of the whole tribe, rather than turning the issue of a crime over to the state or law enforcement. "
77,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"This book occasionally made interesting points in comparing ""traditional"" societies to modern Western ones. However, it often felt pedantic, rambling, and born of the stodgy conservatism old liberals gradually acquire while reassuring themselves that they're just dispensing plainspoken wisdom. In short, it was a lot like reading a book of pop anthropology written by Andy Rooney. I found it to be quite a disappointment coming from an author I otherwise like. It wasn't all bad, though. There were interesting snippets about blood feuds that reminded me of Girard. There are interesting accounts of different childrearing practices. However, there is also a lot of talk about ""states"" in an abstract, anthropomorphic way that seems imprecise and pretty unhelpful in ways. And the fact that the book basically ends on an exhortation to give a light touch to the salt shaker makes it feel like you just got a well-meaning lecture by your grandfather. Likely to be met with many good-natured eye-rolls. "
78,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926778-cynde-moya,4,"Like all of Diamond's books, this one is considered, balanced, intriguing, and fun and easy to read. Some of the things we can learn are about government, child rearing, and nutrition. For example, we may have a romantic notion of the benefits of tribal organization, but the tribal peoples themselves prefer the benefits of a centralized government such as imposed peace, better food and clothing, and the ability to travel more than 20 miles without fearing being killed as a stranger. Diamond prefers certain child-rearing techniques such raising children in extended families and encouraging multi-age playgroups. His advice about carrying children at eye-level rather than pushing them around backwards in a pram is a phenomenological eye-opener. His chapters on the explosion hypertension and diabetes, explained sociobiologically, are intriguing. He realizes his advice to exercise and to limit salt, fat and calorie intake is both banal and crucial. I really enjoyed this read, and am looking forward to dipping into his suggested readings."
79,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23136559-henry-kim,5,"This book was a page turner and as such I really recommend this book to anybody fascinated by traditional societies. I could not stop reading this book since he compares the everyday lifestyle of modern humans to that of more traditional tribal societies. I was satisfied at the ending since this book is not an encyclopedia but rather a well thought out review of common features of eating habits to resolving conflicts. I didn't really relate to the characters as they were too different, but I could see where their lifestyle was going and their motivations. Since this book was not meant to be entertaining, it was not suspenseful but the myriad of facts you will find are interesting. This does involve current issues such as the increase of old people and decrease of birth rates and as we discover more and more about these traditional societies we will understand how they struggle with everyday and widespread problems. Overall, this book is great, fun, and like all his other books, interesting."
80,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346363-matt-heavner,3,"The overall theme was quite good (""tradtional"" cultures have already ""done the experiment"" -- with a huge range of diet, child rearing, elder treatment, conflict resolution, etc.. and since we can't just run these in a scientific, controlled study, hypothesis driving manner, we should at least look back at all the experiments already run). The book did resonate strongly with this theme at several points, but it also lost the resonance too often. This was verbose (how can a book not be verbose? :). But sometimes this book turned into ""my travelogue"" with minimal tie to ""what we can learn."" (I remember a long story about finding the troubles of landing a helicopter and finding the right ""owners"" of land to ask permission, etc.. etc... etc... that didn't really add much to the theme of the book for me.) Collapse and Guns, Germs, Steel were much ""tighter"" books. This one was still quite interesting and had good stories, but wasn't as thematically tight."
81,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1590672-sandy-d,3,"This was interesting, but if you've had introductory anthropology, there's not a lot that will be eye-opening for most readers.Diamond covers a lot - too much, really, in my opinion. Each section - warfare and violence, justice, parenting and the elderly, danger and risk assessment, religion, language, and health - could easily have been a single book. Diamond has interesting insights into most of these areas, drawing on his fieldwork in New Guinea, but he is not the most gifted nonfiction writer out there, and several (loooong) sections are rather pedantic, plodding, or repetitive.It is still worth reading, even if you skim the sections you're not really interested in, and his critiques of both WEIRD (Western, education, industrialized, rich, and democratic) societies and different native cultures are cogent and perceptive."
82,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17613779-fraser-sherman,4,"Mercifully Diamond isn't telling us that the primitive lifestyle is best (or that there's only one such lifestyle) or that evolutionary pressure has molded us to do things one way which is why we're so screwed up. Instead he looks at a variety of primitive cultures and the different ways they tackle such matters as childcare, eldercare, hunting, trade, dealing with strangers and danger; the point isn't so much how the modern world should do things as that there are alternatives we may not even realize exist. Near the end of the book, though, the analysis becomes canned (nothing he says about traditional vs. modern diet is very new). And I'm puzzled that he has nothing about love/sex/marriage except in passing (talking about parenting or the web of relationships that can link tribes and bands, for instance). Overall though, most satisfying."

Not surprisingly, the writing is as pedestrian as his other books. A reader will tolerate this as long as its focused but Diamond quickly lost his focused in this book. His stated aim was to compare traditional societies to modern societies and see if there's any lessons to be learned. The book degenerates into a chance for Diamond to voice his opinions on various topics with little reference to traditional societies. In the he references only his knowledge of Papua New Guinea. The reader is then left with an impression of a man whose prior writing has allowed him the freedom to write as he pleases and he chose to ruminate and voice his opinion."
84,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,2,"Took me two months to finish because it's so very, very tedious. 10 pages here, 10 pages there, just to get through it because I hate starting and not finishing a book. And this coming from someone who ranks Guns, Germs and Steel as one of her top favorite books of all time!Don't read this if you have ANY background in anthropology, sociology or history. It's all painfully obvious, nothing here is a revelation and the chapter on healthy eating is painfully obvious. Also lacking were the positions of women in tribal societies, and religion, which was ever so slightly touched on but I felt Diamond could have spent a great deal more time on.All and all it was BORING. I'd learnt this all in undergraduate classes at uni, or even in high school."
85,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42796094-diane,5,"Love all of Diamond's books. This one has been more difficult and taken me longer to read, perhaps because his topics cover such a wide range of human behavior, and of so many societies, including that of our own western state-run world. But nonetheless, I find the book quite fascinating and would recommend it highly. I just finished the chapters on war, and on child-raising and am currently on attitudes towards elders. IMO, the book provides a background for comparison and re-evaluation of many beliefs we hold so dear in our own 21st century societies. I admit to not having much background on studies of what the life of a hunter-gatherer is like, and Diamond's honest (sometimes brutally so) stories were very surprising. "
86,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," I liked this book a lot. It shows the variety of lifestyles lived by traditional people before the modern world changed the way we all live. In many ways living without states (courts, police forces and armies) was treacherous. Many advantages accumulate by living in a modern society. A doubled life expectancy is one of them as is the much reduced likelyhood of dying a violent death. The are some practices of traditional societies which we would be better off adoption. These might be the way we treat the elderly and children and possibly some diet changes. However the book mainly made me appreciate how lucky I am to live in a modern country."
87,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46654175-laura-trombley,3,"This book reads more like a textbook than Guns, Germs, and Steel and is a little less captivating. It is still a good read. The book studies hunter-gatherer people that still exist in the world or at least who did during the lifetimes of people living today. Based on his experiences with the people of Papua New Guineau and Africa and some South American peoples he compares the hunter- gatherer lifestyle to our own. The author does not want to romanticize the life that was all of ours until very recently in human existence but does wish to extol its virtues for our possible consideration to adopt into our lifestyles. I like this author and plan on reading more of his works. "
88,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book has a fair number of entertaining anecdotes but it didn't seem to have an overarching theme. Diamond would cite an example of one researcher observing a specific behavior in a traditional society without giving the reader evidence that this behavior was the norm. If you wander through present day United States would could observe all sorts of behaviors that would not give you real knowledge of how most people live here. I expected more and was disappointed. Still, the book was interesting enough to give it 3 stars."

I absolutely loved reading the chapters on child-rearing and food. I wish every helicopter parent in America would read this and get a freaking grip. Let your kids be their own masters, quit directing their social lives and putting them in adult-led activities every hour of the day, and let them do things wrong and learn from their mistakes once in awhile!"

This book did not meet up to the same levels of expectations. It was extremely verbose and it was just difficult to see where Diamond was going... most cases, there wasn't really any point except that we are all weird in how we do things and the weird examples discussed about traditional societies aren't so weird after all.

91,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144119-rochelle,4,It took me nearly a year to finish this book. I would pick it up and then put it down over and over again. I skipped 1.5 chapters on war because I couldn't get into them. Some chapters contained fascinating facts and comparisons and others were just verbose. I wish there was a 3.5 star button. It felt like a chore to finish this book but in the end there are a lot of things I'll remember about it. 
92,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1017155-andy,5,"This book gives us the perspective that we need in order to build happier lives in the modern age. The main thing that I gleaned was how compartmentalized and regimented our lives are today--and how that leads us to be unhappy--whereas traditional societies are much less so. Work, education, and play are all intertwined, and more intergenerational in traditional societies. There are tons more insights within the book, but this one in particular resonated with me."

Main takeaways: be paranoid about dangers that are low probability/high frequency, entertain yourself, observe carefully, eat slowly. "
94,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1079988-cathy,3,"At times the author makes broad generalizations with a tendency to sentimentalize hunter-gatherer groups. For example, some of his comments on breast-feeding, childcare and treatment of the elderly don't take into account that trends in our culture vary widely from generation to generation. Offering comparisons of current trends in our own culture to other cultures doesn't recognize the wide variation in belief and practice and makes me wary of his comments on other cultures. "

ISBN 9781101606001. Pagine 512. 13,61 €images-amazon.comSuperato il traguardo dei 75 anni, Jared Diamond ha sentito il bisogno di scrivere una summa delle sue ricerche, ma anche delle sue convinzioni. O almeno così penso io, sia perché è una tentazione abbastanza frequente tra gli scienziati e gli accademici al momento di lasciare l’insegnamento e la ricerca attiva, sia perché – benché il filo conduttore del sottotitolo, Che cosa possiamo imparare dalle società tradizionali?, faccia da collante tra i vari capitoli – ognuno dei temi del libro avrebbe potuto costituire a pieno titolo un saggio a sé stante.D’altro canto, Diamond ci ha sempre sorpreso per la vastità e l’apparente dispersione dei suoi interessi: dopo essersi addottorato in fisiologia sull’assorbimento del sale nella vescica, ha studiato sul campo (e continua a farlo) gli uccelli della Nuova Guinea e delle isole del Pacifico, ma la sua fama è legata soprattutto ad Armi, acciaio e malattie, un’originale sintesi di storia e geografia che gli ha valso un premio Pulitzer per la saggistica e fama mondiale. Lascio che sia la voce di Wikipedia a riassumerne i contenuti per voi: Il libro è incentrato sulla ricerca di una risposta alla domanda che Yali, un abitante della Nuova Guinea, fece all’autore nel luglio del 1972: “Come mai voi bianchi avete tutto questo cargo e lo portate qui in Nuova Guinea, mentre noi neri ne abbiamo così poco?”, dove per Cargo si intendono tutti quei beni tecnologici di cui i guineani erano privi prima dell’arrivo dei coloni. In pratica l’autore cerca di rispondere alle seguenti domande: perché sono stati gli europei e gli americani del nord a sviluppare una civiltà tecnologicamente avanzata e non, ad esempio, i cinesi o i sumeri? Perché gli europei sono partiti alla conquista degli altri popoli (ottenendo evidenti successi, spesso con tragiche conseguenze per i “conquistati”), e non è avvenuto il contrario? Come mai i fieri guerrieri nativi americani sono stati spodestati dall’invasione di un popolo di agricoltori? Riunendo in un unico libro cognizioni dalle più svariate discipline, Diamond sviluppa un quadro d’insieme sulla storia delle varie società umane a partire dalla fine dell’ultima glaciazione, avvenuta circa 13.000 anni fa. Per la prima volta, si riunisce nella visione storica un quadro formato da archeologia, antropologia, biologia molecolare, ecologia, epidemiologia, genetica, linguistica e scienze sociali, per non parlare della teoria del caos. In pratica l’autore cerca di dare una sorta di metodo d’indagine scientifico ad una disciplina considerata finora “letteraria” e di respingere spiegazioni razziste della storia dell’umanità, non tanto per motivi ideologici, ma piuttosto, appunto, scientifici. Consapevole del suo ruolo di iniziatore, precisa che la sua è solo una visione generale, i cui dettagli vanno indagati più approfonditamente.Non riesco a ricordare in che modo sono venuto a conoscenza di Guns, Germs, and Steel. Ho la prima edizione britannica (Jonathan Cape) e ho la certezza (e la prova) di averlo comprato all’Anglo American Book Co. di via della Vite, a Roma. Ricordo di esserne stato conquistato fin dalla prima pagina del Prologo, quella in cui Yali pone la famosa domanda sul cargo (sapevo già qualcosa sui cargo cults delle isole del Pacifico) e di averlo divorato (il libro, non il cargo).Subito dopo sono andato a cercare gli altri libri di Diamond: The Rise And Fall Of The Third Chimpanzee (Il terzo scimpanzé. Ascesa e caduta del primate homo sapiens) e Why Is Sex Fun? (Perché il sesso è divertente?). Del primo ho la prima edizione britannica in brossura (Vintage): l’edizione è del 1992, ma io possiedo l’undicesima ristampa e sono certo di aver letto il libro dopo Guns, Germs, and Steel. Non ricordo dove l’ho comprato, ma nell’ultima pagina del testo c’è ancora, come segnalibro, un biglietto della metropolitana di Lisbona del 14 agosto 1998: ne desumo che non posso che averlo letto, o almeno finito, dopo quella data. Sul secondo qualche certezza in più: ho di nuovo la prima edizione, questa volta americana (BasicBooks) e l’ho certamente acquistato su Amazon il 4 giugno 1998: Amazon.com tiene traccia di tutto, e quindi posso raccontarvi che è stato in assoluto il mio primo avventuroso ordine su Amazon; che insieme al libro di Diamond mi sono fatto mandare Girlfriend in a Coma di Douglas Coupland, Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative di Edward R. Tufte e Timequake di Kurt Vonnegut; e che ho speso in totale, compresi i costi di spedizione, $ 109,87.Poi ho dovuto aspettare il 2005 per leggere Collapse (Collasso. Come le società scelgono di morire o vivere): di nuovo una prima edizione americana (Viking), di nuovo un acquisto (ormai meno avventuroso) su Amazon.com, il 19 gennaio 2005. Il segnalibro all’ultima pagina è il tagliando di un concerto all’Auditorium Santa Cecilia del Parco della musica di Roma: un Requiem di Brahms diretto da Antonio Pappano il 9 maggio 2005.Ormai siamo all’epoca contemporanea: perché di Natural Experiments of History, curato da Jared Diamond e James A. Robinson ho scritto una recensione su questo blog qualche mese fa.Tornando a The World until Yesterday – fatta la doverosa premessa che il libro è sempre ben argomentato e interessante e che la voce di Jared Diamond è inconfondibile e convincente – ho due problemi: il primo è che non tutti i temi affrontati sono, almeno per me, dello stesso interesse; il secondo è che, nel tentativo di rispondere alla domanda Che cosa possiamo imparare dalle società tradizionali?, Diamond a volte dà risposte che nemmeno il compianto Massimo Catalano. Ad esempio: dobbiamo seguire l’esempio delle società tradizionali che rispettano gli anziani (anche perché sono merce rara, mentre da noi sono inflazionati), ma non quello delle società tradizionali in cui si usa abbandonare i vecchi a morire d’inedia o strangolarli direttamente prima di lasciare il campo: «!Jul’joh/ansi, controlla di aver spento il nonno e il fuoco». Ancora: dobbiamo seguire l’esempio delle società tradizionali in cui il bambino non perde mai il contatto con la mamma per i primi 4 anni di vita (per fortuna i miei ormai sono grandi, se no sai che palle), ma non quello delle società tradizionali in cui si pratica l’infanticidio dell’eventuale gemello o del fratellino nato troppo a ridosso del precedente (eppure io, che sono il primogenito e ho una sorella nata 14 mesi dopo di me, quelle pratiche tradizionali le comprendo, anche se non le approvo). Il problema – lo avevamo visto anche nei libri precedenti – è che Diamond è scrupoloso e rigoroso al limite della pedanteria (per quello mi piace!), e ritiene suo preciso dovere fare un sunto degli argomenti e delle argomentazioni alla fine di ogni capitolo, senza lasciare alcun filo pendente …Tornando al primo dei problemi che ho individuato, penso sia utile elencare i diversi argomenti trattati nei diversi capitoli: Amici, nemici, stranieri e persone con cui si commercia Guerra e pace Cura della prole Trattamento degli anziani Risposta ai pericoli Religione Lingue Salute e abitudini di vitaPersonalmente, ho trovato di particolare interesse i primi 2 argomenti, il quinto e il sesto e, in parte il settimo.Sopra tutto, ho apprezzato in modo particolare i racconti autobiografici tratti dalle sue esperienze dirette (Jared Diamond ha fatto una vita veramente interessante e avventurosa la sua parte, anche se non so fino a che punto invidiarlo), mentre sono rimasto freddo ai consigli utili, soprattutto quando si confondono con un salutismo e una political correctness un po’ New Age (guarda un po’: ero convinto che Diamond vivesse nella hippieggiante California, non nell’austero New England).Ma la cosa veramente importante da portare a casa di questo libro è il concetto (e il principio) della constructive paranoia, di cui si parla spesso, ma segnatamente nel capitolo dedicato alla risposta ai pericoli.* * *Le solite citazioni (riferimento alle posizioni Kindle). Potete saltarle, se credete, ma se volete leggerle, armatevi di pazienza, perché sono parecchie. […] “constructive paranoia.” […] [665: la prima volta che ne parla è qui] Traditional societies represent thousands of millennia-long natural experiments in organizing human lives. We can’t repeat those experiments by redesigning thousands of societies today in order to wait decades and observe the outcomes; we have to learn from the societies that already ran the experiments. [703] Evidently, traditional trade has social and political as well as economic functions: not merely to obtain items for their own sake, but also to “create” trade for advancing social and political goals. [1368] Citizens are dissuaded in two ways from resorting to private violence: by fear of the state’s superior power; and by becoming convinced that private violence is unnecessary, because the state has established a system of justice perceived to be impartial (at least in theory), guaranteeing to citizens the safety of their person and their property, and labeling as wrong-doers and punishing those who damage the safety of others. If the state does those things effectively, then injured citizens may feel less or no need to resort to do-it-yourself justice, New Guinea–style and Nuer-style. (But in weaker states whose citizens lack confidence that the state will respond effectively, such as Papua New Guinea today, citizens are likely to continue traditional tribal practices of private violence.) [1720] One example is the so-called Soccer War of June–July 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. At a time when tensions between the two countries were already high over economic disparities and immigrant squatters, their soccer teams met for three games in a qualifying round for the 1970 World Cup. Rival fans began fighting at the first game on June 8 in the Honduran capital (won 1–0 by Honduras), and the fans became even more violent at the second game on June 15 in the El Salvador capital (won 3–0 by El Salvador). When El Salvador won the decisive third game 3–2 in overtime on June 26 in Mexico City, the two countries broke diplomatic relations, and on July 14 the El Salvador army and air force began bombing and invading Honduras. [2433] I sympathize with scholars outraged by the mistreatment of indigenous peoples. But denying the reality of traditional warfare because of political misuse of its reality is a bad strategy, for the same reason that denying any other reality for any other laudable political goal is a bad strategy. The reason not to mistreat indigenous people is not that they are falsely accused of being warlike, but that it’s unjust to mistreat them. The facts about traditional warfare, just like the facts about any other controversial phenomenon that can be observed and studied, are likely eventually to come out. When they do come out, if scholars have been denying traditional warfare’s reality for laudable political reasons, the discovery of the facts will undermine the laudable political goals. The rights of indigenous people should be asserted on moral grounds, not by making untrue claims susceptible to refutation. [2694] Richard Wrangham argues that two features distinguish those social species that do practise war from those that don’t: intense resource competition, and occurrence in groups of variable size such that large groups sometimes encounter small groups or individual animals which they can safely attack and overwhelm by numbers with little risk to the aggressors. [2716] Surveys by Louis Harris and Associates showed that American people believe that the elderly are bored, closed-minded, dependent, isolated, lonely, narrow-minded, neglected, old-fashioned, passive, poor, sedentary, sexually inactive, sick, unalert, unproductive, morbidly afraid of death, in constant fear of crime, living the worst years of life—and spending a good deal of their time sleeping, sitting and doing nothing, or nostalgically dwelling upon their past. [3905] […] Iban of Borneo […] [3927: una popolazione particolarmente interessante, come i Pin di Celebes e gli Userid di Komodo] One obvious negative consequence of those demographic facts is that society’s burden of supporting the elderly is heavier, because more older people require to be supported by fewer productive workers. That cruel reality lies at the root of the much-discussed looming crisis of funding the American Social Security system (and its European and Japanese counterparts) that provides pensions for retired workers. If we older people keep working, we prevent our children’s and our grandchildren’s generation from getting jobs, as is happening right now. If, instead, we older people retire and expect the earnings of the shrinking younger cohort to continue to fund the Social Security system and pay for our leisure, then the financial burden of the younger cohort is far greater than ever before. And if we expect to move in with them and let them privately support and care for us in their homes, they have other ideas. One wonders whether we are returning to a world where we shall be reconsidering choices about end of life made by traditional societies—such as assisted suicide, encouraged suicide, and euthanasia. In writing these words, I am certainly not recommending these choices; I am instead observing the increasing frequency with which these measures are being discussed, carried out, and debated by legislators and courts. [3997: certo che questo getta una luce diversa sul dibattito attualmente in corso in Italia] All of us kept shouting “Tolong!” (Indonesian for “help”), but we were far out of hearing range of the sailing canoes in the distance. [4364: quindi il ""Tolong, tolong, tolong, tolong"" della leggendaria Mucca Carolina era un disperato grido d'aiuto?] […] traditional people have none of the means of passive entertainment to which we devote inordinate time, such as television, radio, movies, books, video games, and the Internet. Instead, talking is the main form of entertainment in New Guinea. [4685] But there are two other big differences between environmental hazards in modern societies and in traditional societies besides the particular hazards involved. One difference is that the cumulative risk of accidental death is probably lower for modern societies, because we exert far more control over our environment even though it does contain new hazards of our own manufacture such as cars. The other difference is that, thanks to modern medicine, the damage caused by our accidents is much more often repaired before it kills us or inflicts life-long incapacity. […] Those two differences are part of the reason why traditional people so willingly abandon their jungle lifestyle, admired in the abstract by Westerners, who don’t have to live that lifestyle themselves. […] “Rice to eat, and no more mosquitoes!” was their short explanation. [4769-4774-4779] The adoption of agriculture enabled formerly nomadic hunter-gatherers to settle down in crowded and unsanitary permanent villages, connected by trade with other villages, and providing ideal conditions for the rapid transmission of microbes. Recent studies by molecular biologists have demonstrated that the microbes responsible for many and probably most of the crowd diseases now confined to humans arose from crowd diseases of our domestic animals such as pigs and cattle, with which we came into regular close contact ideal for animal-to-human microbe transfer only upon the beginnings of animal domestication around 11,000 years ago. […] They do have infectious diseases, but their diseases are different from the crowd diseases in four respects. First, the microbes causing their diseases are not confined to the human species but are shared with animals (such as the agent of yellow fever, shared with monkeys) or else capable of surviving in soil (such as the agents causing botulism and tetanus). Second, many of the diseases are not acute but chronic, such as leprosy and yaws. Third, some of the diseases are transmitted inefficiently between people, leprosy and yaws again being examples. Finally, most of the diseases do not confer permanent immunity: a person who has recovered from one bout of a disease can contract the same disease again. These four facts mean that these diseases can maintain themselves in small human populations, infecting and re-infecting victims from animal and soil reservoirs and from chronically sick people. [5043-5048] […] kwashiorkor […] [5114: una malattia dovuta alla deficienza di proteine] The significance of sex and food is reversed between the Siriono and us Westerners: the Sirionos’ strongest anxieties are about food, they have sex virtually whenever they want, and sex compensates for food hunger, while our strongest anxieties are about sex, we have food virtually whenever we want, and eating compensates for sexual frustration. [5123] A similar modern case of field scattering by Andean peasant farmers near Lake Titicaca, studied by Carol Goland, provoked development experts to write in exasperation, “The peasants’ cumulative agricultural efficiency is so appalling…that our amazement is how these people even survive at all…. Because inheritance and marriage traditions continually fragment and scatter a peasant’s fields over numerous villages, the average peasant spends three-quarters of his day walking between fields that sometimes measure less than a few square feet.” The experts proposed land-swapping among farmers in order to consolidate their holdings. But Goland’s quantitative study in the Peruvian Andes showed that there really is method to such apparent madness. In the Cuyo Cuyo district, the peasant farmers whom Goland studied grow potatoes and other crops in scattered fields: on the average 17 fields, up to a maximum of 26 fields, per farmer, each field with an average size of only 50 by 50 feet. Because the farmers occasionally rent or buy fields, it would be perfectly possible for them in that way to consolidate their holdings, but they don’t. Why not? A clue noticed by Goland was the variation in crop yield from field to field, and from year to year. Only a small part of that variation is predictable from the environmental factors of field elevation, slope, and exposure, and from work-related factors under the peasants’ control (such as their effort in fertilizing and weeding the field, seed density, and planting date). Most of that variation is instead unpredictable, uncontrollable, and somehow related to the local amount and timing of rain for that year, frosts, crop diseases, pests, and theft by people. In any given year there are big differences between yields of different fields, but a peasant can’t predict which particular field is going to produce well in any particular year. What a Cuyo Cuyo peasant family has to do at all costs is to avoid ending up at the end of any year with a low harvest that would leave the family starving. In the Cuyo Cuyo area, farmers can’t produce enough storable food surpluses in a good year to carry them through a subsequent bad year. Hence it is not the peasant’s goal to produce the highest possible time-averaged crop yield, averaged over many years. If your time-averaged yield is marvelously high as a result of the combination of nine great years and one year of crop failure, you will still starve to death in that year of crop failure before you can look back to congratulate yourself on your great time-averaged yield. Instead, the peasant’s aim is to make sure to produce a yield above the starvation level in every single year, even though the time-averaged yield may not be highest. That’s why fiel"

There are chapters and pages in which I wondered the purpose of the book, and if this was really from the same writer of Gun, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. Two books which I think everyone should read. The confusion wasn't because of his personal accounts what has happened in his field studies, but chapters that seemed thin and not so well put together and pointless. Before you stop reading my review and conclude that this is not a book for me, wait. There were several good chapters where the comparison between Western societies and traditional societies were valuable. For me, those were Peace and War and Young and Old. Those two chapters make up everything. There is also a short chapter about religion, and while it is not mind-blowing, it is a good summary of the reasons why we have religions and why even when they are costly, they might aid survival.The whole book is one long argumentation of the benefits of traditional society when it comes to child-rearing, taking care of the elderly, living together with others and not feeling alienated and isolated, and praise for their ingenuity. Diamond says that there is a lot we should learn from these disappearing traditional societies before we think the Western way of life is the norm, that diet, consumption, and individualism danger our lives and cause us psychological and physiological problems. I don't disagree at all with him, but the book felt repetitive and stating the obvious.  Yet I liked bits like this:""The flip side of that overriding emphasis on social networks in traditional societies is our greater emphasis on the individual in modern state societies, especially in the United States. We not only permit, we actually encourage, individuals to advance themselves, to win, and to gain advantages at the expense of others. In many of our business transactions we aim to maximize our own profit, and never mind the feelings of the person on the other side of the table on whom we have succeeded in inflicting a loss. Even children's games in the U.S. commonly are contests of winning and losing. That isn't so in traditional New Guinea society, where children's play involves cooperation rather than winning and losing.""For instance, the anthropologist Jane Goodale watched a group of children (the Kaulong people of New Britain) who had been given a bunch of bananas sufficient to provide one banana for each child. The children proceeded to play a game. Instead of a contest in which each child sought to win the biggest banana, each child cut his/her banana into two equal halves, ate one half, offered the other half to another child, and in turn received half of that child's banana. Then each child proceeded to cut that uneaten half of the banana into two equal quarters, ate one of the quarters, offered the other quarter to another child, and received another child's uneaten quarter banana in return. The game went on for five cycles, as the residual piece of banana was broken into equal eights, then into equal sixteenths, until finally each child ate the stub representing one-thirty-second of the original banana, gave the other last thirty-second to another child to eat, and received and ate the last thirty-second of another banana from still another child. That whole play ritual was part of the practicing by which New Guinea children learn to share, and not to seek an advantage for themselves.""As I read that part, the idea of a game being like that sounded alien to me. It seemed more like sharing to me than an actual game, but that was the point. I have taught early on that games are about winning, being better than others. This is also so in school rooms where we compete to get better grades to succeed in life instead of cooperating so that the whole society enjoys the accumulated knowledge. The western world is riddled with losers. That is a hurtful mentality both for the individual and for the community. Had we just lost someone valuable, and for what?But to conclude, Jared Diamond doesn't romanticize traditional society. For example, he points out that life expectancy is lower in traditional societies and not only because of scarce food and medication but also because of violence and risk. So read this book or not? I would say, read it. The first pages are a chore, but they are followed by the two chapters I liked the most. I have mixed feelings about the last chapters. There are good bits, but then there is a lot of repetition, stating the obvious, and to some too much personal preference.Thank you for reading and have a lovely day!"
116,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"Early in this book (and also at other places within the text) Diamond argues that one of the reasons for examining other societies is to attempt to balance out the bias inherent in modern studies of human nature and psychology: they tend to be studies undertaken mainly by those who belong to societies which can be grouped as Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic, thus forming the acronym WEIRD. The intention here is to provide a warning as to the potential weirdness of specific studies, especially if one were to generalise from them as applicable across the human spectrum. This book examines stories and anecdotes from 39 different non-WEIRD societies spread across the globe (they are located and named in a map located at pages 26–27 in my edition). He refers to these societies as “traditional”, as opposed to our “modern” societies — an understandable distinction, but one that should be taken up with caution, since the word “tradition” has many powerful connotations outside the restricted interpretation provided here.At the same time, Diamond warns that we must not go to the opposite extreme and consider these other societies as somehow being ideal or romanticised as being superior in some ways to our own. To this extent, the stories provided do present what comes across as a comparatively balanced picture from each of these societies: bad features as well as good. And some of those “bad” qualities, albeit “justified” to some extent by the circumstances in which each society finds itself, will prove to be quite alarming and horrifying to our modern sensibilities. The subjects covered in the first four parts include: “space” (i.e. which part of the land, or which territory, belongs to whom); determining friends, enemies, strangers, traders; war; concepts of the justice systems used; famine and the lack of food; the treatment of children; the treatment of older people; responses to various dangers and diseases; etc. Some of the horror-situations include: infanticide, almost certainly if the child is born deformed or ill, but also of the second of twins, where the second child will not be able, for various reasons, to be fed or nurtured correctly; the abandonment or the killing of older people no longer able to provide some benefit to the community; the lack of parental or other guidance in child care (such as those permanently scarred (if not killed) by fire or from knife wounds); the lack of sanitation and hygiene generally (only those who develop the appropriate immunity will survive); etc.Throughout these four parts, Diamond more or less keeps to his general overall theme: all surviving societies, despite what we might think of some of their practices, have both good and bad points, but ultimately they have managed to survive, many most probably for thousands of years. Where there might be some “good” qualities we Westerners might benefit from, he tends to offer them for our consideration. These include such things as: Restorative Justice systems which involve all the relevant affected persons face-to-face; the usefulness of older people in taking care of and in training the young, especially by providing respite for parents; the usefulness of providing what he calls Constructive Paranoia as an adjunct to surviving potential dangers; etc.What emerges, as far as I can ascertain, is that each of these societies, each in their own ways, have accommodated themselves and their societies, large or small, to their environments, and despite some horrible situations, have managed to survive for thousands of years, and are still surviving, at least until the “yesterday” of the title of the book. So far, so good.It is at this point, however, that things appear to go haywire. I believe this occurs mostly in the last section (Part Five: Religion, Language and Health) which consists of a chapter on each of these three topics. Here, the writing seems to switch gears, as it were — one suspects a sleight of hand… These three topics, as presented, appear to stem from Diamond’s “traditional” societies: they each have some kind of “spiritual” beliefs and practices; they often need to be at least bilingual, and maybe even multilingual, if only to be able to successfully trade with others; and they all have special diets relative to their location, some of which seem to have specific “benefits” for specific health issues relating to non-communicable diseases.But the arguments presented relating to these topics could only have come from a WEIRD background. They are more generic than specific. They become prescriptive in relation to our “modern” world; and thus by definition are presented as criticisms of the way we operate in the world today. One could easily go through each of the points raised and provide counter-arguments, or alternative interpretations, but that is not necessary: the real problem is that these ideas are commonplace, and strike me as New Age type aspirations which, while consisting basically of truisms, end up sounding shallow and comparatively insignificant when long-term survival is being considered.They are aspects of the problems facing the world today, but they seem relatively trivial when compared to the larger issues they are part of: global warming; rampant consumerism with in-built obsolescence of products to maintain economic growth; blatant corruption on just about every level of society; global imperialism of international companies; political unrest and social upheavals; uneven distribution of wealth with ever-increasing disparity between the very rich and the very poor; international terrorism; privacy concerns of individuals in an ever-more invasive electronically controlled society; etc., etc. From this perspective, Diamond’s concerns in Part 5, while true per se, ring hollow indeed.But what is worse, questioning thus raised by this Part of the book can, and in my case did, lead to questioning the bases of the first four Parts. How relevant are the stories and anecdotes as such to the rest of the society in which they occurred? How accurate are they in regard to the rest of that society? How representative? How typical are they of the norms for that society? How honest are some of the stories told? And so on… And once those questions are raised, one might quite easily find oneself wondering just how scientifically valid it can be to make general extrapolations and comparisons when 39 completely different societies spread right across the globe are referenced and cross referenced within the confines of the pages of this book?As a result, everything starts unravelling at an alarming rate. One begins to become aware of just how “spotty” the whole venture becomes. Ultimately one begins to wonder how relevant any of these stories are to the concerns and problems of the modern world.To be fair, one needs to assert that Diamond’s heart appears to be in the right place, and his overall theme of learning about, understanding and empathising with humanity in general is praiseworthy. In a sense, Diamond’s “modern” world has in fact addressed and solved many of the worst problems faced by his “traditional” societies, but in the process has created its own problems in the solutions it has provided.The question of whether one is better or worse than the other is besides the point. Humanity has survived, and will no doubt continue to survive, whatever Nature and Society throw up against it. It has not, not will it always be a pleasant ride, and often enough throughout history we have all been made aware of just how horrible, painful and terrifying it can all be at times; but in the end, humanity remains. This, at least, was what I was taking from the first four parts of this work; and in my opinion, the book would have been better if it had stopped with this. The addition of Part 5 ruined this for me: some small relevant parts of these pages could easily have been inserted in appropriate places throughout the first four parts, but the rest of it (especially the detailed statistics and charts in some sections, which were more obscurantist than illuminating) would have resulted in a better outcome had it been excised altogether."
117,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42673069-brett-matthews,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel was an outstanding book, offering deep and original insights into the dynamics that have shaped our modern world, and the way poor and rich human communities on our planet are inter-related. The World Before Yesterday is interesting, but far less compelling. Diamond’s goal is to learn lessons for our modern ways of being and interacting from “thousands of natural experiments in how to construct a human society”. These ‘natural experiments’ evolved in every corner of the globe before the rise of the first states about six thousand years ago. He calls these ancient ways of being human, now rapidly vanishing, ‘traditional’ societies. Diamond’s focus in this book is where his heart is - Papua New Guinea – and the book includes many personal stories. PNG includes many of the most traditional societies on earth. And human development there has been compressed into a shorter timeframe than almost anywhere else on earth, any time in history. Five years after the invention of electric light, limited colonization began in 1884 in the northeast on the country. In the early 1930s airplane reconnaissance discovered nearly a million people living in highlands previously believed uninhabited, triggering a decade of ‘first contact’ encounters followed by trickles of missionaries, traders, teachers and government officials. Diamond first visited PNG in the early 1960s, and has been returning ever since, giving him a front-row seat in an awe-inspiring and unimaginably complex historical and evolutionary process. We have all heard stories of ‘culture shock’ experience by friends returning from far away. Diamond’s insights and descriptions of culture shock are worthy of an elder voice who has often bracketed – in the same week -- camping in the timeless New Guinea bush and juggling tribal languages, with driving in Los Angeles traffic and juggling back-to-back deadlines. Guns, Germs and Steel was animated by a single compelling question, heard from a Papuan on a beach (“Why do you people have so much, and we have so little?”). The vector animating The World Until Yesterday is much more diffuse, and this is a problem. The book brings the best modern evidence and science to the nine topics it addresses, but these topics represent a small sub-set of the possibilities, and his inquiry in each is driven by a different vector, leaving the reader unable to get a fix on the overall direction. For example, before PNG was colonized the people lived in reasonably settled communities of less than fifty or so families, and rarely moved more 10 or 20 km from their homes. To do was ‘suicide’, Diamond argues, because strangers were automatically feared and distrusted, unless some sort of blood or community relationship could be established. In the past few thousand years, humans have gradually overcome this fear of strangers through a drip-by-drip recognition of an ‘expanding circle’ of relationships (Peter Singer’s phrase). This makes it possible for strangers in every tribe in PNG to freely and safely meet and mingle in Port Moresby, the nation’s capital, just as they might in New York or Tokyo. Having already asked “why do we modern-world people have so much, and why do you have so little”? Diamond might have tackled the natural follow-up question in this book: “how can you get what we have?” Unfortunately, he does not. His 4-stage framework for human development, which progresses from ‘bands’ to larger ‘tribes’, still-larger ‘chiefdoms’ and finally modern states, can’t answer this question. Very few humans, including in PNG, now live in Diamond’s ‘traditional’ societies – instead they live in some sort of ‘transitional’ society on the path to modernization. They live – at least officially – in states. They may attend school for a few years. They live in monetizing economies, increasingly cook with store-bought oil and sugar, transfer money to their parents on mobile phones, and walk under power transmission wires to reach the inter-village market. But the chief and witch doctor hold as much – or more - sway in their lives as the state and the health clinic. They save in pre-cash stores of value, like chickens or gold. They may be more multi-lingual than their traditional ancestors, speaking several local languages as well as one or two national and international ones. And their lives are still defined by a drumbeat of food security priorities that often make schooling look decidedly more like indulgent consumption than serious investment. Like the traditional societies Diamond writes about, these transitional worlds are “thousands of natural experiments in how to conduct a human society”. They represent a fusion – often difficult and awkward – between traditional and modern cultures and ways of being. They evolve and adapt out of the ‘world until yesterday’ that Diamond depicts. Many will move from traditional worlds to modern ones if they get a chance (few move the other way). But mostly they have little choice but to stay put, and wrestle with the challenges that modernity throws at them. In the process they are creating new memes that address all the trade-offs that Diamond discusses: what’s more important to me – expressing my individuality or complying with traditional expectations about how I behave – or can I have both together? Using my time productively or maintaining social relationships – or can I have both together? Cultivating my spiritual traditions or abandoning them for modern religion – or can I have both together? Defending traditional (communal) property rights or accepting modern (individual, scientific) revisions to tradition? Learning to read a modern language with a mushrooming smattering of expressions in text, or learning to speak more local languages with virtually no text at all (except a dictionary and a Bible)?We should find all of this familiar. In America we endlessly debate the visibility of Christmas in the public square (a traditional way of being for us) and have struggled for centuries with trade-offs between traditional role expectations and human rights. And we are faced with similar challenges all the time in the modern world, embroiled in technological and social transformations. Modern culture is quite different. Relatively speaking, it values social relationships less than using time productively, and Christianity has become our spiritual ‘tradition’, which we are tempted to replace with modern (non-)religions like atheism. In our post-literate culture we struggle with the amount of time and investment we devote to the internet. Compared to people in traditional societies, we have far more resources at our disposal to leave traditions behind us, yet seem to cling to them with a ferocity that is innately human.Papuans have given up more traditional expectations, and created more new balancing points for themselves, in the past century than most modern societies have done in five centuries. Diamond has been criticised for investing too much admiration in the traditional, but this criticism is misplaced. He admires the stoic and cheerful Papuan adaptation to global norms. It will take a different book to systematically categorize the challenges and opportunities, for local and modern cultures as they encounter one another, that can ease and accelerate that adaptation.

118,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89392089-tony-tauro,4,"To get it out of the way: this is not a gripping book or a breezy read. You would want to be committed to reading it to complete it. Some of the ideas feel repetitive and tend to wear down one's concentration. There are a wide range of ""characters"" - essentially the different tribes and peoples being studied and referenced to, and it is hard to keep all of their settings/locales in context to properly understand what is being said. In hindsight this book might have made a better read if each chapter dealt with a particular tribe starting with an introduction and work that through as a story. Instead the book is organized as chapters based on certain traits and concepts. The author has good reasons to do so no doubt.The book is probably best read as a reference book or scholarly work. The introductory characters should be properly understood first. Then when entering each chapter, one would need to understand what the objective is and let the author walk you through how that set of traits or way of life differs between the different communities in question.Overall this book is a great resource on understanding how traditional societies live, implying how our own ancestors probably this. For most of human history our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. We often look at certain modern behaviors and attribute them to our ""caveman ancestors"". Whatever the logic/value of those attributions, the reality is that our post-Cognitive Revolution, pre-Industrial Revolution - in other words hunter-gatherer - ancestors were mostly like us in terms of cognitive ability but lived not in caves but in bands and occasionally chiefdoms. This book presents a wealth of knowledge on how they would have lived and depending on the context has profound implications for our current societies.I was particularly struck by how children were treated. We know that infanticide and abandoning babies was common. So was maternal mortality during pregnancy. But otherwise children were cared for in many ways far better than they are in Western society today. Some societies never beat their children, even treating insolence with laughter. In one particular case a parent beating a child could be claimed by the other parent as grounds for divorce! They also don't let babies cry. If a baby would cry it would be seconds before either the mother or some other adult picked up the baby. Babies also had a lot of human contact through touch for the first few years of their life. Children also led a lot more simulating childhoods being allowed a lot more freedom to play and explore their surroundings.The book abounds with gems like these. Overall a good read, though I do wish it was compressed somewhat. Or maybe a lot!"
119,0670024813,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,4,"I really enjoyed Jared Diamond's two major books before this, Pulitzer Prize-winning 
Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies
 and 
Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed
, both of which expound the author's theory of how and why human civilizations rise and fall. This book is based on his own anthropological research among hunter-gatherers in New Guinea; he looks at those and similar societies, and, without sugar coating their downsides, shows that they hold important lessons for modern Westerners.The book is well organized into five parts containing 11 chapters, plus a prologue and epilogue. Topics he looks at are war and peace, conflict resolution, raising children, treatment of the elderly, risk management, diet, and multilingualism. The section on hunter-gatherer religion was a little disappointing and taught me nothing I didn't already know, but I did appreciate his explanation about the different roles that religion plays in our lives (providing explanations, comfort, moral codes, et cetera) and that the relative importance of these roles varies with time and place (e.g. supernatural explanations and justification for political organization are no longer very important, emotional comfort still is). Those interested in hunter-gatherer religion are encouraged to read

 and 
The Evolution of God
. Another subject that I wish he'd gone into more depth with is sex and attitudes on sexuality in hunter-gatherer societies; I'm sure there is a lot of research on the topic. Diamond does discuss the lack of privacy briefly (p. 202) but there was a lot he left unexplored that I'm curious about now.I enjoyed the chapter on child rearing, which can be summarized thus:We are struck the the precocious development of social skills in their children ... [observers] speculate that these admirable qualities develop because of the way in which their children are brought up: namely, with constant security and stimulation, as a result of the long nursing period, sleeping near parents for several years, far more social models available to children through allo-parenting, far more social stimulation through constant physical contact and proximity of caretakers, instant caretaker responses to a child's crying, and the minimal amount of physical punishment. (208)Risk management was also a good topic explored. Given the likelihood that minor injuries could be disabling or lead to deadly infection with their lack of medical knowledge, primitive people need to be very cautious. ""A common Western reaction to danger that I have never, ever encountered among experienced New Guineans is to be macho, to seek or enjoy dangerous situations, or to pretend to be unafraid and try to hide one's own fear,"" writes Diamond (284). These people intuitively understand that even small dangers, if encountered with great frequency, must be accounted for.These are also extremely violent societies. They engage in warfare very frequency and have a plethora of other violent acts For instance, ""the homicide rate for the !Kung works out to 29 homicides per 100,000 person-years, which is triple the homicide rate for the United States and 10 to 30 times the rates for Canada, Britain, France, and Germany."" (288) The existence of states and their hierarchies actually makes it easier for groups to end wars and enforce peace in ways that Diamond discusses. (For more on hunter-gatherer warfare and violence see 
Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors
 and 
Constant Battles: Why We Fight
.) The sections on diet were fascinating, and have lead to changes in my own diet and corresponding improvement in my blood pressure. Our bodies are not designed for the world of abundance that most of us Westerners enjoy; we need to discipline ourselves in order to avoid obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. In the past, those of us who retained salt and calories more effectively were at an advantage when a famine came, as they frequently did; ironically, those adaptations that helped our ancestors are killing us now that we have too much food, and unhealthy food at that. Ever wonder why Pacific islanders tend towards obesity? It's because all of their ancestors survived lengthy cross-ocean voyages in dugout canoes and only the voyagers with genes that helped them store fat survived. Diamond also explains that Europeans are actually better suited for this abundance than others, as we've had longer to adapt genetically to it. Diamond is clear that while these societies have lessons that we shouldn't ignore,we should ... not go to the opposite extreme of romanticizing the past and longing for simpler times. Many traditional practices are ones that we can consider ourselves blessed to have discarded--such as infanticide, abandoning or killing elderly people, facing periodic risk of starvation, being at heightened risk from environmental dangers and infection diseases, often seeing one's children die, and living in constant fear of being attacked. Traditional societies may not only suggest to us some better living practices, but may also help us appreciate some advantages of our own society that we take for granted."" (9)He also points out thatIt's not the case that citizens of Westernized societies are fleeing in droves from steel tools, health, material comfort, and state-imposed peace, and are trying to return to an idyllic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Instead, the overwhelming direction of change is that hunter-gatherers and small-scale farmers who know their traditional lifestyle, but who also witness a Westernized lifestyle, are seeking to enter the modern world. (455) Overall, the book is quite excellent and readable without prior background. Some of the autobiographical bits seemed a bit drawn out, but they did have points and the prologue and epilogue did frame the book nicely. 4/5 stars and highly recommended."
