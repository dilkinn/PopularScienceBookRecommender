0,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"This is pretty much the opposite of a self-help book. Instead of telling you how you can be happier, Harvard Psychology professor Gilbert talks about why we are so bad at predicting what will make us happy in the first place. Gilbert is a smooth and entertaining writer, and he does a good job of explaining in detail the cognitive errors we make in trying to predict our future happiness. For those who hope to gain some practical value from the book, Gilbert also outlines one technique that has been effective in predicting future happiness, but then goes on to discuss the reason why the vast majority of humans won’t use it. Still, I found the book more uplifting than depressing, as there’s something comforting about knowing that everyone else makes the same kinds of mistakes that I do, and the mind is much more skilled at finding happiness in unexpected places than we imagine."
1,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Years ago there was a poster that appeared around Melbourne of a young man with one of those far away looks in his eyes. The photo in the poster was extreme close up and the expression on the young man’s face was that which I believe only comes from religious ecstasy or a particularly transporting bowel movement. In bold type under this young man’s face was the single word Happiness. Below this in smaller type was Transcendental Meditation. I figured we were talking religion rather than laxative in this particular case. I remember thinking when I first saw this poster that if THAT is happiness then I would rather be un-happy (or perhaps that should be non-happy? Hard to say).This book made me happy. At times it made me use the laugh I generally only reserve for a Wodehouse Wooster novel. The guy who wrote 50 Psychology Classics got me onto him by comparing him to Bryson. Actually, Bryson can be a little more surreal in his humour – particularly in Notes from a Big Country – but I still LOL-ed.Premise of the book. Why is it that we prove to be remarkably hopeless at judging what later versions of ourselves will like or want? We marry people we think we will be happy with in old age only to toss them in mid-life. We study to be idealists and philosophers only to end up cynical readers of psychology. Why are we so hopeless at working out what will make us happy?The answer this book provides isn’t going to win it the Dr Phil ‘Put a Smile on Your Dial’ Award for best self-help book. But it might just help you to understand why we tend to be unimpressive at knowing what is going to make us happy.This really is a wonderful book. The discussion on conjoined twins saying they are ‘happy’ and our normal responses to hearing this (‘the poor wee things, they can’t know any better, imagine them thinking they are happy’) made me cringe as only a patronising overstatement of what I was thinking myself can do. About 10 years ago I went to a high school reunion. I knew it would be a mistake and I wasn’t disappointed. What was interesting was that I’ve always seen myself as quite different from everyone I went to school with. But that afternoon I found I was as bland everybody else. Everyone, it seemed, had two kids, lived within 5 kilometres of school and worked in the city. Whatever details separated us, what united us seemed much more obvious. I’ve never felt more like a cog in a machine.But I walked out of there and went back to believing I’m an individual and remained contented in my own non-identity with those around me. This book has had much the same effect as that high school reunion. In fact, the lesson of this book is that we are much more like everyone else than we like to imagine – and it is this disinclination to admit to it that is one of the major reasons why we are so terrible at predicting what future events will be like for us.For example, tomorrow you are going to go blind – how do you think you are going to feel? I guess the words, “Not particularly delighted”, don’t quite cover it. But this book points out that we generally thing we are going to feel infinitely worse than we actually end up feeling. We think we would ‘rather be dead’ – whereas people who end up blind generally don’t end up killing themselves over it. And if we underestimate how unhappy we will be if bad things happen to us we also overestimate how happy we will be when good things happen to us.This book doesn’t really offer any answers – if you are looking for the answer to the question what is happiness you will probably have to turn to your guru of choice. What this book does do is show how we are remarkably consistent at fooling ourselves in ways that have negative effects on our happiness and shows some ways we may be able to take control.I don’t want to spoil this for you – but the bit about the people in the old people’s home who had control over when young visitors would come see them was one of the saddest things I’ve read in a long time. Is there anything sadder than our unintended consequences when they cause infinite harm to others? When, ‘but I really didn’t mean it’ just doesn’t sate our despair.If I have a preference for people it is for people who make me laugh, It is a sad fact that I’m more likely to think someone is ‘on the money’ if they also make me smile. Of course, there probably is no relationship at all between the worth of an argument and how often the writer makes me smile – but you’ll never convince me of that. This is a wonderful book and well worth reading. I’ve started to watch the You-Tube Video Richard attached – it looks great, but it is too late for me now. There will be time for such a word. Oh, and that is the other reason why I loved this book. Each chapter starts with a remarkably apt quote from Shakespeare. Got to love someone who quotes Shakespeare at you and does so in context."

When we imagine future feelings, we find it impossible to ignore what we are feeling now and impossible to recognize how we will think about the things that happen later.Forgive my rather ""meh"" response to this book. And it was a very bored response. But that isn't the book's fault, it's my fault.If you have a background in psychology, a degree in psychology, or work in the field of psychology, this book will be old hat to you. Gilbert presents these studies and experiments and psychological insights that will be stunning and revolutionary to anyone who is uneducated in psychology, but to someone who has been trained in psychology, there is absolutely nothing new to offer here.This is NOT a self-help book. I know it looks like a self-help book and is titled as a self-help book, but it is really a psychology book. This book will NOT help you be any happier in your life. Gilbert's whole main point is that your brain acts and reacts in ways that are beyond your control. Even when you are told about them and warned about them, you can't stop them. So no self-help here. Instead, this is a look into psychology and a bit of neuroscience (but only the most minuscule bit).Gilbert discusses things like resiliency, selective memory, and expectations about the future. I really enjoy psychology books, but I felt this one did not offer anything new to anyone with a psychological degree or education. If you DO NOT have training in psychology - I would recommend this book. It will be interesting to you, Gilbert makes some great points, and he is funny. I mean, actually very amusing and lighthearted. And you will learn some psych basics without boring texts or going to class.But if you ARE someone with a psych background, skip this - you will be bored out of your skull, and Gilbert will just be telling you what you already know.Recommendations for people who already have tons of psychology knowledge:A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness EXCELLENTOn Depression: Drugs, Diagnosis, and Despair in the Modern World EXCELLENTThe Sibling Effect: What the Bonds Among Brothers and Sisters Reveal About UsThe Compass of Pleasure: How Our Brains Make Fatty Foods, Orgasm, Exercise, Marijuana, Generosity, Vodka, Learning, and Gambling Feel So Good - I gave this four stars, it's not five-star material.Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of ThingsThe Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting"
3,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,3,"This is another one of those books, like Blink or Outliers, where an author applies science in an unorthodox way, flings a bunch of interesting anecdotes and studies at you, and pretends to draw more conclusions than are actually warrented. You can tell because the cover is completely white with a single, extra shiny object slightly off-center and the title in a trendy modernist color.I'll give Gilbert this--he's an unusually witty writer. I literally laughed out loud throughout this book. But I think in the end, it's fluff--in one ear and right out the other. I'm still not sure what I've actually absorbed.Gilbert's basic thesis boils down to the fact that the trait that lets us build civilizations--imagination--constantly deludes us into misjudging what will make us happy. Which is good for civilization-building--without it, we'd probably be scratching our privates in a jungle with the bonobos. But since it's not something we can turn off, or are willing to, it means we'll all spend our lives chasing phantoms, trying to please a future self who will wonder what we were thinking.I don't recall any glaring flaws in his argument, although there's not much that can easily be used to refute it here. If there's research counter to his results, it's not like I know what it is. For once, there are no sweeping pronouncements made--he pretty much shrugs his shoulders and says that it's human nature to be a little bit delusional, and there's really nothing to it. Kind of refreshing, actually. "

5,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,1,"Is it just me, or is the author of this book unusually cocky in his writing style? Gilbert reiterates a bunch of basic ideas that any normal, reasonably intelligent person should already have arrived at (like, you shouldn't judge another person's life without all of the facts, and, wow, things never turn out quite how you plan them) and then acts like he's discovered a new planet. His tone is one of an utterly brilliant professor talking down to his idiotic, simple students. I was actually, mildly offended by this book, and as you can probably tell by the rest of my selections, I am not easily offended. I'm happy to read all about views I disagree with, just don't treat me like an idiot! This book just wasted my time. I was so infuriated with it that my husband had to remind me that it's just a book and I could put it down if it was so bad - but I couldn't stop, because it just got worse and worse! Even the forward to the book, with acknowledgements, is cocky beyond belief. Gilbert first says ""Actually, I wrote this book all by myself, without any help,"" before acknowledging that he borrowed lots from his students' research. What? Unbelievable!"

Dennett in the first five pages, so how could I not love it?May 2007, upon completion: Update... Ultimately, I decided to give this book three stars because I believe that it is a ballsy and well-executed attempt to take on an impossibly difficult problem (happiness - that's a biggie). For the most part, I admire Gilbert's methods, though they ALL become incredibly frustrating somewhere around page 200. The book is witty, incredibly well researched, and Gilbert is (mostly) unwilling to extrapolate the massive amounts of data he compiles into proscriptive solutions for finding happiness. Fortunately, these make the book:* pretty easy to follow* informative and enlightening (if you're not already familiar with most of the research - some of the psychological effects he outlines are well-known to the point of being cliché, but many are either head-scratchers or jaw-droppers on their own merits or are interpreted here in interesting ways which bolster his mostly critical (rather than constructive) thesis)* very NOT another preachy or rosy-tinted self-help franchise (yet).Unfortunately: * the tone ultimately makes the book repetitive and tiresome (much like being in the room with an otherwise intelligent person who laughs a little too much at their own jokes)* the research often obfuscates rather than elucidates already fuzzy points (again, he makes his criticisms clear, but sometimes it's unclear what he is actually trying to *say* by pointing them out)* for most of the book it seems as though he's really verging on some great ideas, but doesn't want to stick his neck out for them, which leaves the reader exhausted trying to generate their own implications and solutions for the problems he identifies...You can read the rest of my review here (it was too long for goodreads): http://caitfish.livejournal.com/14552...And a subsuquent review after some more thought:http://caitfish.livejournal.com/14589..."
7,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/536991-foster,4,"I just finished Daniel Gilbert’s new book, and it’s highly recommended. Next time in Cambridge, I’ll be asking him to join me at Grafton Street for a Guinness (you’ll get this if you read the book).He uses one of the most humorous and accessible non-fiction, science-related writing styles to explain a whole genre of psychological, psychiatric, and philosophical research. His basic message is that we are crap at remembering our past happiness, and also terrible at making decisions that would increase our future happiness. His advice – trust the testimony of others when deciding what choices to make.Here are some choice bits from the book, but again – I recommend you take the time to enjoy it for yourself! “[When we ask kids what they want to be when they grow up] they generally come up with things like “the candy guy” or “a tree climber.” We chuckle because the odds that the child will ever become the candy guy or a tree climber are vanishingly small…But notice that while these are the wrong answers to our question, they are the right answers to another question, namely, “What do you want to be now?”…At some point between our high chairs and our rocking chairs, we learn about later.” “When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen.” “The point here is that we generally do not sit down with a sheet of paper and start logically listing te pros and cons of the future events we are contemplating, but rather, we contemplate them by simulating those events in our imaginations and then noting our emotional reactions to that simulation. Just as imagination previews objects, so does it prefeel events.” “Among life’s cruelest truths is this one: wonderful things are especially wonderful the first time they happen, but their wonderfulness wanes with repetition…Psychologists call this habituation, economists call it declining marginal utility, and the rest of us call it marriage…One way to beat habituation is to increase the variety of one’s experiences. Another way…is to increase the amount of time that separates repetitions of the experience.” “As soon as our potential experience becomes our actual experience…our brains get busy looking for ways to think about the experience that will allow us to appreciate it.” “Research shows that when people are given electric shocks, they actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value…If you’ve managed to forgive your spouse for some egregious transgression but still find yourself miffed about the dent in the garage door…then you have experienced this paradox.” “Inescapable circumstances trigger the psychological defenses that enable us to achieve positive views of those circumstances, but we do not anticipate that this will happen.” “Uncertainty can preserve and prolong our happiness, thus we might expect people to cherish it. In fact, the opposite is generally the case…Our relentless desire to explain everything that happens may well distinguish us from fruit flies, but it can also kill our buzz.” “Because we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times, [experience] does not always pay clear dividends.” “In short, the production of wealth does not necessarily make individuals happy, but it does serve the needs of an economy, which serves the needs of a stable society, which serves as a network for the propagation of delusional beliefs about happiness and wealth.”"
8,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,3,"Note: the title reads Stumbling On Happiness, not Stumbling Onto Happiness. Thus, Daniel Gilbert's book does not go into self-help. Rather, it delineates the many errors we humans make when solidifying decisions and how our minds trick us into choosing things that might not lead us to happiness in the long run.A few cool concepts stood out to me when reading Stumbling On Happiness: how we kind of suck at predicting our future emotions because our present state influences us so much, how certain societal ideas like needing money or wanting kinds propagate even if they do not make us happy, and how the brain constructs experiences based on biased memories as opposed to objective truths. Gilbert writes in a witty, smart, and accessible way. He incorporates psychological research, philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, sociology, behavioral economics, and more to strengthen his points. The broad scope of this book makes it appealing to individuals with a wide array of interests, spanning hard and social sciences.I only wish that Gilbert had tied all his ideas together with a little more incisiveness. At times it felt like he just listed experiments and made some general comments about them instead of tying them altogether. Even though this book circumvents the self-help genre, I wanted to read more solid connections between Gilbert's remarks and how they relate to happiness. Stumbling on Happiness could have used a stronger thesis: it reads fine as a general list of cognitive fallacies we make, and it could have been even better with a dose of additional punch.Overall, recommended to those intrigued by the book's synopsis, this article about happiness, or those intrigued by cognitive psychology. A well-researched book with some witty, substantial ideas, even if not all of them will stay in my memory (as Gilbert himself suggests)."

I'll continue to fool myself that I know what I'm doing, feeling, seeing and thinking, but thanks to this book, I hope that I'll increase the basic level of happiness to which all people seem to revert to eventually. I immensely enjoyed the brilliant writing and the wit of the author, which definitely added to the pleasure of reading this book. ""Despite the third word in the title, this is not an instruction manual that will tell you anything useful about how to be happy... Instead, this is a book that describes what science has to tell us about how and how well the human brain can imagine its own future, and about how and how well it can predict which of those futures it will most enjoy... Weaving together facts and theories from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, this book allows an account to emerge that I personally find convincing but whose merits you will have to judge for yourself.There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."""

It exposes all the weaknesses we have in our thinking process, helps break down things we consider ""normal"", and much much more. Very good material, highly recommended!"
11,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085095-guy,3,"First thing you need to know about this book: it's cognitive psychology, not self-help. To Gilbert's credit, he states this clearly early on... but by then, for many purchasers, it will be too late, since the cover fairly shouts ""Self-Help!!"".So, to be clear: ""Stumbling on Happiness"" won't do much to help you be happy, but it will help you understand some of the many reasons as to why, despite our best efforts, we so often fail to be so.But only some of the reasons, and frankly only some of the simpler and more basic ones. Gilbert is interested in, and explains well, how the brain works to construct reality as we experience it... and how some common mistakes we make can therefore be understood. He has nearly nothing to say, however, about the social and cultural context in which people live, and the many and various ways in which the wider world influences our happiness (or lack thereof).Ultimately therefore, this is akin to reading a book about what optical illusions tell us about the brain's visual system, rather than a critical analysis of painting that explains why we perceive one work as a masterpiece and the next as merely ordinary. And this matters, because creating happiness is not just a question of the plumbing of the brain (although it is clearly important to understand this too); it is more like creating a masterpiece.Last complaint: despite a fairly engaging style and some humour, this is closer to being an academic thesis than a popular science book. I felt it could have been boiled down to about fifty pages without losing much. There are some interesting and amusing studies and anecdotes... but there are many more that just make the same or closely related points over and over.Bottom line: interesting, but somewhat misleading and not a must-read."

Imagining 'what it would feel like if' sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting.""""Your mistake was not in imagining things you could not know- that is, after all, what imagination is for.

14,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/255516-alicia,5,"Stumbling On Happiness and is my current rebellion book. (It isn't on my assigned reading list.) and it is a fascinating book. The author explores our perception of happiness and why we consistantly guess wrong about what will make us happy. How, once a moment has passed, it is impossible for the individual who experienced the moment to accurately rate how happy that moment made us because, our subsequent experiences change how we view that experience. How convinced we as Americans are that are happiness will always increase, that something better is always going to be happening in the next experience and how we neglect our best resource (other people) to predict which experiences will make us happiest because of our compelling need to be unique (even though it has been proven that people are more alike than different.)Very interesting stuff to ponder."
15,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906691-scott,5,"Combining the rigor of scientific inquiry with the affability of a humorist, this remarkable book examines the brain's systematic inability to reliably predict what will make us happy. Gilbert shows how neurological structures that allow us to store and re-imagine information may serve us all too well, creating a persuasive yet fundamentally distorted picture of what we want and why we want it. A life-changing book, or at least ought to be. This, more than any other recent read, is the one I'm recommending to all my friends and family."

17,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,5," Definitely the most amusing science book I have read this year. I love Daniel Gilbert after watching his really cool video on youtube. Instead of being a lame self-help guide which it may look like, this is a psychology book which analyzes how we think about what happiness is, what is going to make us happy, might be fundamentally wrong. The ability that sets human beings apart from a lot other animals is imagination, functioned by the frontal lobe. However, our imagination can be misleading because it adds and removes details, makes the past or the future more pleasant than they actually were (or will be), fails to realize that things will feel differently once they actually happen.Gilbert's advice is to use other people's experiences to predict the future, instead of imagining it. However, at this point I disagree with him because people's personalities, perception of the world and situation will have impact on their level of happiness over the same event. This is where the book is very American-or European-centered because it assumes that everyone has enough to eat, has the same holiday option or lives in a basically homogeneous culture. Therefore, their experience of similar events will be similar. However, Gilbert's imagination of the usefulness of this advice in making people happy can be wrong too. Overall, Gilbert rocks! Highly recommended"
18,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1218675-c,2,"I really struggled to finish this book, despite the warm praise from Malcom Gladwell and Seth Godin and my interest in the subject. Make no mistake: Daniel Gilbert is an academic. Stumbling on Happiness reads like a rather dry lecture from a mildly-entertaining Harvard professor. Gilbert rattles off studies at a brisk pace, strong handling his thesis and leaving you nodding off before you know it. He expounds upon our inability to estimate how we'll feel once we get what we desire and the perils of our (limited) imagination. Brilliant? Witty? Not in my opinion. Gilbert takes a fascinating subject and manages to suck all the air out around it. What this book needs is less ""witty"" attempts to connect and a better editor. A simple wrap up of the ideas presented at the end of each chapter and a good slashing of the extraneous could go a long way to making this a happier read."
19,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,4,"Gilbert's argument in this book is the best endorsement for reading other people's reviews of the book, because if what he says is accurate, they are more reliable indicators of customer satisfaction than how customers imagine they'll feel after making any purchase. If that seems like a no-brainer, then you won't find yourself greatly illuminated by this book. While I'd still give this book 4 stars for its often interesting survey of cognitive research about the behavior of imagination in predicting future happiness and/or regret, any reasonably introspective person of a certain age will have already made many of these observations by paying attention to their own lives and the lives of other people.Malcolm Gladwell has given a celebrity review of this book, and Seth Godin's blurb on the back cover compares Gilbert to Gladwell, but don't be fooled - they're in a different league. Don't expect Gladwell's kind of science writing, with its brilliance of speculation and the implications of fascinating research results. Gilbert wants to tickle your funny bone, too, like he's entertaining a lethargic class of undergraduates. As others have noted, that tone wears thin after a while.Will you be happy after you read this book? Maybe some, maybe not much. Now you know . . . "

It reads like a psychology lecture by a pompous professor who is more amused by his own knowledge than in the passion and excitement of learning. And much like most college classes, even though there are a few laughs, it mostly just drags and drags...."
21,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/889873-cjasper,3,"I think this book should have been called Stumbling on Humility, cause what I took from it is that I'm not even as happy as I thought I was, and really, I didn't think I was that happy to begin with. So, I get it, our perception is flawed. Our ability to remember, perceive and predict is not well developed. I have thought of this book and brought it up in conversation quite a bit because either a)it has a lot of real life applications or b) I'm kind of obsessed with the subject of happiness. I will say that I think he used the term happiness in a lot of scenarios when I would have used pleasure. It has been a long time since I thought a piece of pie or a new couch or sex with an attractive partner would make me happy. They give me pleasure, but to make me happy, I'd need to make the pie and share it, have some company on that couch or find intimacy with someone I have a connection with (aka my awesome husband). I found it kind of annoying that Gilbert didn't distinguish. "

I came to know about it through a TED talk by the same author.The books sheds light, ""social-sciencly"" (read the 'not-in-dictionary' word as an adverb), on happiness. The main take is that biases creep in all of us and it is more often that not that we fail to know what will bring us more happiness. We always fail in our estimates/projections. But wait, there is a solution to it. And guess what? I am not telling you the solution but you will find it in the book. Enjoy."

24,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"This study of how our minds work provides an interesting insight into the human condition. The book examines why we are not very good at achieving happiness even though we're very good at imagining scenarios of our future happiness. The book's narrative unfolds like a psychological detective story about the mystery of why there is so much pursuit of happiness but so little satisfaction at achieving happiness. After all, pursuit of happiness must be very important to us since it is one of the inalienable rights referenced in the U.S Declaration of Independence. Almost all reviews of this book note that this is not a ""how to"" book as inferred by the title. My thought is that this may indeed be a better ""how to"" book than most books that claim to explain ""how to"" achieve happiness. After all, isn't knowing one's self the first step toward such a goal? And what better way to know one's self than to understand the workings of the human brain. The first part of this book reminded me some of the material covered in the book, Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior by Temple Grandin (link is to my review).The following short review of this book is from the PageADay Book Lover's Calendar for June 8, 2017:Renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert takes a look at how human beings tend to miscalculate their future happiness. Gilbert uses the latest scientific research in the areas of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics to show what scientists have learned about a human's ability to predict the future, and, more important, what they'll think about it when they actually get there. Time called it “a fascinating new book that explores our sometimes misguided attempts to find happiness.”
STUMBLING ON HAPPINESS,
 by Daniel Gilbert (Knopf, 2006)"
25,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,2,"Central message: our minds trick us the same way our eyes trick us with visual illusions. And we are foolishly un-aware of the ways it tricks us. The rest of the book is basically a list of psychology experiments backed up by pretty horrible long-winded prose to explain how that applies to our daily lives, sprinkled with annoyingly ""witty"" jokes. His ""wit"" was not funny to me, but merely annoying, like someone trying really hard to counteract his innate boring-ness w/ strained jokes. While I did appreciate the science behind this book, I felt that his writing style was bloated and dull (even when the subject matter was so interesting). He seems to think that the more you repeat a thing that is self evident, the more interesting it becomes. Perhaps he also underestimates his reader's ability to get something after reading it a couple of times. He needs a good editor; this book could have been cut down to 150 pages (instead of 240 minus notes). I would recommend reading Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience instead, which is excellently written and researched, and covers a more satisfying aspect of Happiness. This book is still worth reading, though, and works as a good complement because it's nice to have some insight into how we trick ourselves (which Flow really doesn't cover). But this book tackles happiness in a most superficial way; it would be more fitting to say it tackles brain-illusions. It should be called ""Brain Illusions: How the mind tricks you daily"" instead of ""Stumbling on Happiness"", which is kind of a misnomer. Overall, Dan Gilbert could've afforded to be a little more ambitious and visionary with all this data."
26,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990235-froztwolf,5,"The most enlightening work I have ever read on how we fail to make decisions in a way that makes us happy. Happiness can be seen as being produced by two actions:  1) Making good day-to-day decisions, to create circumstances that allow us to be happy  2) Being happy regardless of the circumstancesIt appears that we are fairly bad at #1 but really good at #2. The book explores why this is, through a bottom-up approach; first exploring the roles of memory and imagination in the decision-making process, then how these two things fail us and finally what the results of that are. There is a short ""What can we do about it"" chapter towards the end, with great advice that almost certainly nobody will use. However, I find that just being aware of the shortcomings and biases of my own mind are much more valuable, so I'm perfectly happy that most of the book is spent on this part.While I have not looked up any of the sources, the book is firmly rooted in psychological research and does not appear to stretch or editorialize for the sake of alliteration or making a point. Full of funny and quotable nuggets like: ""My friends tell me that I keep pointing out problems without offering solutions, but they never tell me what to do about it.""The writing is light and jovial and everything is tied together in a consistent structure. Nothing is missing and nothing is superfluous. All-in-all a fun and extremely useful read for anyone interested in how and why we aren't perfect."
27,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624741-laura,4,"If you are technical or scientific then ""Stumbling on Happiness"" may be a good read for you. For me, Daniel Gilbert's conclusions were fascinating but most may be garnered by reading his articles or the last chapter of his book. As Gilbert admits in his foreword, his book is not about happiness so much as it is about the way that our minds work in an attempt to find happiness. Particulary interesting to me were his findings on children and happiness. ""Every human culture tells its members that having children will make them happy."" However, studies on marital satisfaction show that couples are happiest when they are married without children and when they are empty nesters. Couples are least happy when their children are teenagers, pre-school age, and newborns. Studies on women, in particular, showed that they were ""less happy when taking care of their children than when eating, exercising, shopping, napping, or watching television,"" with looking over children being ""only more slightly pleasant than doing housework."" "
28,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"As others have pointed out, contrary to what might think, this is not a self-help book. Rather, it's a book about cognitive biases that interfere with our ability to understand and predict exactly what makes us happy. Gilbert is both informative and entertaining, and I enjoyed the book overall but found myself oddly reluctant to pick it up at times. Was it too dense with information? Was it missing a sense of a cohesive thesis statement? Or was it just timing on my part? I'm not sure whether it was the book or me, so I still give it four stars for information and readability when I was into it."
29,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"This book is written by a Harvard Psychologist and is a compilation of research on happiness. It is not a self-help--it's a very realist portrayal of happiness. The thesis is basically that we don't know what makes us happy because of a variety of tricks our brain and memory play on us. We make great plans about the future based on how we think we will feel about certain things, but we are usually wrong about how we would actually feel about those things. The book includes some fascinating studies that I have thought about a lot since I read it. The problem with the book is that his only solution is just to ask other people how they feel about something--that that is the best predictor about how you will feel. He basically says that people are more alike than different. While this is a great and interesting premise, it is not supported by any research like his earlier case for our incapacities regarding happiness. He just mentions it and moves on. All in all, a good read and highly recommended. "

A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
31,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
32,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

34,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
35,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
36,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
37,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."

(We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
39,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."

This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
41,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."

We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "

I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

47,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future.

58,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
59,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
60,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16700055-zhiyar-qadri,5,"one of the best Reads, great explanations of motives and reasons of our attitudes and behaivours when it comes to the pursuits of the ultimate mutual goal HAPPINESS. A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
61,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
62,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness.""

64,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
65,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
66,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
67,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."

(We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
69,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
70,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
71,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."

We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "

I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future.

88,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
89,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."

A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
91,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
92,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book.I originally came across this book at the website of Keith Martin:http://96db.com/books/notes/0554_0/Keith Martin's review said: ""This is a well-written popular science book about the psychology of happiness, and Gilbert does a good job explaining why we humans are horrible at predicting what will make us happy. It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness."" When we imagine the future, we fill in details which may not happen and we leave out details which we can't imagine will happen. (paraphrased) ""But if our big brains don't allow us to go sure-footedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."" [bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1. We get a distorted picture, when we look at the past through the lense of the present.2. Habituation changes our views.3. We tend to rationalize instead of being realisitc.See the audible.com page for this book at:http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Tec...At the above-linked page you can listen to an audio clip of this book.Read partially on computer at:http://books.google.com/ebooks/reader...http://books.google.com/books?id=6h8j..."
94,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
95,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
96,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
97,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
98,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
99,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
100,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
101,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."
102,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010459-b,4,"Two of the abilities that separate us from the beasties; the ability to remember the past and the ability to imagine the future; receive a thorough analysis from author Daniel Gilbert that inform us just how unreliable these faculties can be. We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "
103,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155177-amber-lea,4,"I feel like perhaps this book deserves five stars, but since none of the content was news to me I was kind of bored.This book is mostly about psychology and brain physiology with a side of philosophy. I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

107,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"
108,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12085734-saeed,2,It is far better to read Thinking Fast & Slow or Dan Ariely's books or maybe The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz instead of reading this one. This book doesn't have any recipe for the happiness and all of its contents are about something like actually how our brains are working and thinking!All of the efforts that the author puts in his book are a kind of proof for his below sentence that says:  There is no simple formula for finding happiness.

117,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Keeping it short and sweet,at the beginning of reading this book this example is what real stuck with me ""Nazi war criminal who is basking on an Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary who is being eaten alive by cannibals is""This is all you need to about this book,our so called Happiness is Subjective,we are biased at almost everything and we are not very good at picturing our future,since we tend to mix our presence and bring it to our imaginative future.lets not forget we tend to exaggerate our past experiences or real downside them,as a Dr I have seen this a couples of times whereby a pregnant woman giving birth, screaming and shouting of labour pain and swearing to never get pregnant again,only after one week she will come back,saying she thinking about getting another one.I did agree with most of what the author said on his book,this includes the even the weird points like it's more easy to forgive your sibling or elected president than a random person.All in all its a good read if you are interested in psychology,its not a self help book,on how to be happy.Despite the fact I didn't understood the implication of some of the psychology experiments and many food references but still I enjoyed reading it coz i didn't know,Human Happiness is such a controversial subject,that keeps psychologists and Philosophers awake at night."
118,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
119,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
120,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16700055-zhiyar-qadri,5,"one of the best Reads, great explanations of motives and reasons of our attitudes and behaivours when it comes to the pursuits of the ultimate mutual goal HAPPINESS. A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
121,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
122,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book.I originally came across this book at the website of Keith Martin:http://96db.com/books/notes/0554_0/Keith Martin's review said: ""This is a well-written popular science book about the psychology of happiness, and Gilbert does a good job explaining why we humans are horrible at predicting what will make us happy. It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness."" When we imagine the future, we fill in details which may not happen and we leave out details which we can't imagine will happen. (paraphrased) ""But if our big brains don't allow us to go sure-footedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."" [bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1. We get a distorted picture, when we look at the past through the lense of the present.2. Habituation changes our views.3.

124,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
125,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
126,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
127,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
128,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
129,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
130,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
131,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."
132,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010459-b,4,"Two of the abilities that separate us from the beasties; the ability to remember the past and the ability to imagine the future; receive a thorough analysis from author Daniel Gilbert that inform us just how unreliable these faculties can be. We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "
133,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155177-amber-lea,4,"I feel like perhaps this book deserves five stars, but since none of the content was news to me I was kind of bored.This book is mostly about psychology and brain physiology with a side of philosophy. I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"
138,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12085734-saeed,2,It is far better to read Thinking Fast & Slow or Dan Ariely's books or maybe The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz instead of reading this one.

148,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
149,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."

151,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
152,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book.I originally came across this book at the website of Keith Martin:http://96db.com/books/notes/0554_0/Keith Martin's review said: ""This is a well-written popular science book about the psychology of happiness, and Gilbert does a good job explaining why we humans are horrible at predicting what will make us happy. It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness."" When we imagine the future, we fill in details which may not happen and we leave out details which we can't imagine will happen. (paraphrased) ""But if our big brains don't allow us to go sure-footedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."" [bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1. We get a distorted picture, when we look at the past through the lense of the present.2. Habituation changes our views.3.

154,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
155,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
156,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
157,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
158,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
159,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
160,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
161,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."
162,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010459-b,4,"Two of the abilities that separate us from the beasties; the ability to remember the past and the ability to imagine the future; receive a thorough analysis from author Daniel Gilbert that inform us just how unreliable these faculties can be. We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "
163,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155177-amber-lea,4,"I feel like perhaps this book deserves five stars, but since none of the content was news to me I was kind of bored.This book is mostly about psychology and brain physiology with a side of philosophy. I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"

177,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Keeping it short and sweet,at the beginning of reading this book this example is what real stuck with me ""Nazi war criminal who is basking on an Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary who is being eaten alive by cannibals is""This is all you need to about this book,our so called Happiness is Subjective,we are biased at almost everything and we are not very good at picturing our future,since we tend to mix our presence and bring it to our imaginative future.lets not forget we tend to exaggerate our past experiences or real downside them,as a Dr I have seen this a couples of times whereby a pregnant woman giving birth, screaming and shouting of labour pain and swearing to never get pregnant again,only after one week she will come back,saying she thinking about getting another one.I did agree with most of what the author said on his book,this includes the even the weird points like it's more easy to forgive your sibling or elected president than a random person.All in all its a good read if you are interested in psychology,its not a self help book,on how to be happy.Despite the fact I didn't understood the implication of some of the psychology experiments and many food references but still I enjoyed reading it coz i didn't know,Human Happiness is such a controversial subject,that keeps psychologists and Philosophers awake at night."
178,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
179,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."

A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
181,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
182,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book.I originally came across this book at the website of Keith Martin:http://96db.com/books/notes/0554_0/Keith Martin's review said: ""This is a well-written popular science book about the psychology of happiness, and Gilbert does a good job explaining why we humans are horrible at predicting what will make us happy. It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness."" When we imagine the future, we fill in details which may not happen and we leave out details which we can't imagine will happen. (paraphrased) ""But if our big brains don't allow us to go sure-footedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."" [bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1.

184,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
185,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
186,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
187,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
188,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
189,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
190,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
191,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."

We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "

I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

197,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"

This book doesn't have any recipe for the happiness and all of its contents are about something like actually how our brains are working and thinking!All of the efforts that the author puts in his book are a kind of proof for his below sentence that says:  There is no simple formula for finding happiness.

207,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Keeping it short and sweet,at the beginning of reading this book this example is what real stuck with me ""Nazi war criminal who is basking on an Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary who is being eaten alive by cannibals is""This is all you need to about this book,our so called Happiness is Subjective,we are biased at almost everything and we are not very good at picturing our future,since we tend to mix our presence and bring it to our imaginative future.lets not forget we tend to exaggerate our past experiences or real downside them,as a Dr I have seen this a couples of times whereby a pregnant woman giving birth, screaming and shouting of labour pain and swearing to never get pregnant again,only after one week she will come back,saying she thinking about getting another one.I did agree with most of what the author said on his book,this includes the even the weird points like it's more easy to forgive your sibling or elected president than a random person.All in all its a good read if you are interested in psychology,its not a self help book,on how to be happy.Despite the fact I didn't understood the implication of some of the psychology experiments and many food references but still I enjoyed reading it coz i didn't know,Human Happiness is such a controversial subject,that keeps psychologists and Philosophers awake at night."
208,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
209,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
210,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16700055-zhiyar-qadri,5,"one of the best Reads, great explanations of motives and reasons of our attitudes and behaivours when it comes to the pursuits of the ultimate mutual goal HAPPINESS. A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
211,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
212,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points.

214,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
215,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
216,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
217,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."

(We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness.""

People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
220,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
221,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."

We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "

I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

227,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future.

238,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
239,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
240,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16700055-zhiyar-qadri,5,"one of the best Reads, great explanations of motives and reasons of our attitudes and behaivours when it comes to the pursuits of the ultimate mutual goal HAPPINESS. A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
241,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
242,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness.""

[bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1.

244,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
245,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
246,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
247,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
248,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
249,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
250,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
251,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."
252,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010459-b,4,"Two of the abilities that separate us from the beasties; the ability to remember the past and the ability to imagine the future; receive a thorough analysis from author Daniel Gilbert that inform us just how unreliable these faculties can be. We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "
253,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155177-amber-lea,4,"I feel like perhaps this book deserves five stars, but since none of the content was news to me I was kind of bored.This book is mostly about psychology and brain physiology with a side of philosophy. I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

257,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"

This book doesn't have any recipe for the happiness and all of its contents are about something like actually how our brains are working and thinking!All of the efforts that the author puts in his book are a kind of proof for his below sentence that says:  There is no simple formula for finding happiness.

267,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Keeping it short and sweet,at the beginning of reading this book this example is what real stuck with me ""Nazi war criminal who is basking on an Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary who is being eaten alive by cannibals is""This is all you need to about this book,our so called Happiness is Subjective,we are biased at almost everything and we are not very good at picturing our future,since we tend to mix our presence and bring it to our imaginative future.lets not forget we tend to exaggerate our past experiences or real downside them,as a Dr I have seen this a couples of times whereby a pregnant woman giving birth, screaming and shouting of labour pain and swearing to never get pregnant again,only after one week she will come back,saying she thinking about getting another one.I did agree with most of what the author said on his book,this includes the even the weird points like it's more easy to forgive your sibling or elected president than a random person.All in all its a good read if you are interested in psychology,its not a self help book,on how to be happy.Despite the fact I didn't understood the implication of some of the psychology experiments and many food references but still I enjoyed reading it coz i didn't know,Human Happiness is such a controversial subject,that keeps psychologists and Philosophers awake at night."
268,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
269,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
270,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16700055-zhiyar-qadri,5,"one of the best Reads, great explanations of motives and reasons of our attitudes and behaivours when it comes to the pursuits of the ultimate mutual goal HAPPINESS. A beautiful insightfull science! looking forward to reread it and read other books by Daniel Gilbert "
271,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84282-alana,3,"I was given this book by a friend who likened the style to Alain de Botton. While I don't agree with the comparison, I can understand that the genre bears certain similarities -- a nonfiction book with meandering tone, musing on a single topic -- but because this is primarily about psychology and the way we make decisions, I wouldn't really put these on the same shelf. That being said, this was an interesting read... although I've been ""currently-reading"" this in bits for about a year now, so that might tell you something. It was an excellent subway read, because despite the fact that it's a psychology book, I never really felt like we were going too deep below the surface here, and so I could always put it down and pick it right back up again. I liked that every chapter starts with a quote from Shakespeare... that's a pretty quick and cheap way to gain points, I know, but whatever.Here's the gist of it. Gilbert is trying to explain to us why we suck at projecting ourselves forward to predict how we'll feel in the future and we suck at remembering how we felt in the past, so we can't even really learn from our mistakes. If you're looking for an answer, you won't find it. I realized at one point towards the end that there were forty-something pages of footnotes, which left about twenty pages for Gilbert to come up with with some kind of summary or solution to this problem... and even when I thought that, I realized that his tone pretty much clues you in to the fact that you're not going to get anything to help you out here, besides encouragement that you should keep a bright outlook and pepper your own discussion with humor. If there's any suggestion to be had, it's along the lines of this: we ought to listen to each other more and learn from their experiences. If we're trying to make a decision that will affect our future, talk to people who have already made that decision (or better yet, people who are in one of the potential situations currently)... because really, we're not all so very dissimilar as people anyway (we usually dismiss others' experiences because we overestimate our uniqueness).Gilbert keeps up a fairly playful tone that reminded me of teachers and professors who would slip in silly questions on a test or make amusing lists of things in their lectures. I suppose it's important to keep a pretty cute dialogues going, given the fact that he's basically telling us that chances are, we won't be as happy as we think we will... and when we are happy, we won't be happy long.Here are a few quotes I pulled from the book (though I actually underlined quite a lot, as his tone really did lull me into that student mode):We like to frolic in the best of all imaginary tomorrows--and why shouldn't we? After all, we fill our photo albums with pictures of birthday parties and tropical vacations rather than car wrecks and emergency-room visits because we want to be happy when we stroll down Memory Lane, so why shouldn't we take the same attitude toward our strolls up Imagination Avenue? Although imagining happy futures may make us feel happy, it can also have some trouble consequences. Researchers have discovered that when people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will actually occur. Because most of us get so much practice imagining good than bad events, we tend to overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures.People want to be happy, and all the other things they want are typically means to that end.Imagining ""what it would feel like"" sounds like a fluffy bit of daydreaming, but in fact, it is one of the most consequential mental acts we can perform, and we perform it every day. We make decisions about whom to marry, where to work, when to reproduce, where to retire, and we base these decisions in large measure on our beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't. Our lives may not always turn out as we wish or as we plan, but we are confident that if they had, then our happiness would have been unbounded and our sorrows thin and fleeting. Perhaps it is true that we can't always get what we want, but at least we feel sure that we know what to want in the first place....when we are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes.Just as objects that are near to us in space appear to be more detailed than those that are far away, so do events that are near to us in time. ... When we think of events in the distant past or distant future we tend to think abstractly about why they happened or will happen, but when we think of events in the near past or near future we tend to think concretely about how they happened or will happen....most of us have a tough time imagining a tomorrow that is terribly different from today, and we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We may see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rose-colored glasses are neither opaque nor clear. They can't be opaque because we need to see the world clearly enough to participate in it--to pilot helicopters, harvest corn, diaper babies, and all the other stuff that smart mammals need to do in order to survive and thrive. But they can't be clear because we need their rosy tint to motivate us to design the helicopters (""I'm sure this thing will fly""), plant the corn (""This year will be a banner crop""), and tolerate the babies (""What a bundle of joy!""). We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influences of the other, and our experience of the world is the artful compromise that these tough competitors negotiate....most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies show that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in ever walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did...It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience...We try to repeat those experiences that we remember with pleasure and pride, and we try to avoid repeating those that we remember with embarrassment or regret. The trouble is that we often don't remember them correctly. ... Memory is not a dutiful scribe that keeps a complete transcript of our experiences, but a sophisticated editor that clips and saves key elements of an experience and then uses these elements to rewrite the story each time we ask to reread it....we tend to remember the best of times and the worst of times instead of the most likely of times......the average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of us are making more than a few poor choices....if you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people. Science has given us a lot of facts about the average person, and one of the most reliable of these facts it that the average person doesn't see herself as average.We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Even when we do precisely what others do, we tend to think that we're doing it for unique reasons. For instance, we tend to attribute other people's choices to features of the chooser (""Phil picked this class because he's one of those literary types""), but we tend to attribute our own choice to features of the options (""But I picked it because it was easier than economics""). We recognize that our decisions are influenced by social norms (""I was too embarrassed to raise my hand in class even though I was terribly confused""), but fail to recognize that others' decisions were similarly influenced (""No one else raised a hand because no one else was as confused as I was). We know that our choices sometimes reflect our aversions (""I voted for Kerry because I couldn't stand Bush""), but we assume that other people's choices reflect their appetites (""If Rebecca voted for Kerry, then she must have liked him). The list of differences is long, but the conclusion to be drawn from it is short: The self considers itself to be a very special person.We are the only people in the world whom we can know from the inside. We experience our own thoughts and feelings but must infer that other people are experiencing theirs....we enjoy thinking of ourselves as special. Most of us want to fit in with our peers, but we don't want to fit in too well. We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways. ... Because we value our own uniqueness, it isn't surprising that we tend to overestimate it.But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."
272,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48305350-nguyen-vy,5,"Let's start with what makes this a delightful read. First, it's a psychology book, but not a dry and boring one because the writing is conversational and very undergrad-friendly. Of course it's more like a conversation with a professor (in which he does most of the talking), but this professor is a witty guy and he can keep you amused for a long while on his educational topics. I'm one of those students who like to talk with old funny professors, so perhaps that's why I enjoy this book so much this way. It's like stumbling on a good talk that makes you feel like engaging on it.Second, this book does not lay out to us any specific lists of do-and-don't to guide us to happiness. In fact, the absence of indoctinated instructions has left room for so much more interesting points on memory, perception, imagination, and the limitations of them (when they are used by us to estimate our future happiness). As it turns out, before we go on and contemplate on what makes us happy, we so often forget what is happiness anyway. Is happiness the same for anyone? How it comes to being? What it feels like and how we can measure it? So there we have about eleven chapters to explore the different psychological aspects of happiness which are organized under the three big umbrella concepts of memory, perception, and imagination. At times you might find yourself lost in so many studies and examples (which are told in a very witty manner), but the author does a good job in reiterating his points again for you to recap quite often and you can always keep up with the flow of the arguments. The third reason why I like this book is that as each topic is discussed, I had a good review on what I've learned in psychology before, but this time with many concepts applied in how we can explain the perception of happiness. I got to jot down some notes that surprised me, entertained me, or informed me well. As I flipped to trace the source sections occasionally, I found some further interesting reads that I added some of them to the queue of my reading list. That said, I spent quite some time for this book to allow my mind to digest and though now I've already finished it, the points made in it still keep me thinking for a while. Long story short: It doesn't matter what and how you did something or what you got for yourselves in life (be it material wealth, academic achievements, marriage, whatever). It's how you think about all those stuffs later on in your life that decides if you've been happy. So no matter how much joy I was experiencing while I was reading this book, later on if I forget how I had felt and suddenly have aversion for books over 300 pages, I will claim this book bunky and not worth my time (which is not objectively true but it is so in this theoretical example of myself). Alright, I guess this review will be enough for me to NOT misjudge my experience with it later on. I highly recommend it to myself to read again and to anyone who is looking for a witty psych book. May you go stumbling on something fun!"

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book.I originally came across this book at the website of Keith Martin:http://96db.com/books/notes/0554_0/Keith Martin's review said: ""This is a well-written popular science book about the psychology of happiness, and Gilbert does a good job explaining why we humans are horrible at predicting what will make us happy. It's a fascinating insight into the human condition and an enjoyable read.""There are a lot of insights in this book, ideas which we may consider obvious and other ideas which are counter-intuituive and don't come naturally to us. It's an interesting look into the way our minds work. The author uses various scientific studies to prove his points. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of concentration to understand his wordy, but clear, explanations.CONCLUSION AT END OF THE BOOK:""There's no simple formula for finding happiness."" When we imagine the future, we fill in details which may not happen and we leave out details which we can't imagine will happen. (paraphrased) ""But if our big brains don't allow us to go sure-footedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble."" [bold text mine]Among the stumbling blocks are the following facts (which are explained in the book).:1.Our memories of THE PAST may be flawed because our brains play tricks on us. We ""mis-remember"".2.Our perceptions of THE PRESENT may be flawed for various reasons.3.Our imaginations about what THE FUTURE holds may be flawed.Among the things to remember:1. We get a distorted picture, when we look at the past through the lense of the present.2. Habituation changes our views.3. We tend to rationalize instead of being realisitc.See the audible.com page for this book at:http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Tec...At the above-linked page you can listen to an audio clip of this book.Read partially on computer at:http://books.google.com/ebooks/reader...http://books.google.com/books?id=6h8j..."
274,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Oy. How to talk about this frustrating book. Very funny, but I'm sure some readers would get turned off by his style of wit as it does kinda get old. Lots of insights into how the mind works, but the relevance of those insights is in question.* And who is the audience? I read a lot of popular science books about the brain, the mind, psychology, biology - and anyone with any more training than I would probably be even more frustrated by the author's lack of rigor. But I don't think your average Costco shopper would be interested, either... but maybe they're a good audience because apparently they have trouble realizing that an even bigger TV screen will not necessarily make them happier....Gilbert's theory is that we humans are very bad at predicting what will make our future selves happy, and therefore we make poor choices too often and those choices could be avoided if we listened to others' advice more. But he didn't take into account arguments, anecdotes, or research that would reveal weaknesses in his theory. Yes: our brains do a lot of different things (optical illusions, rationalization, rose-colored glasses, etc.) that can mislead us. And yes: reading others' reviews of products we're going to buy, for example, is helpful. But I don't think what college students predict about their enjoyment of pizza is relevant to my decision to move to a smaller yard-free home. Nor do I think that asking someone who lives in a smaller home is a great strategy because after all, we *are* (despite Gilbert's claims) all different people with different tastes, interests, and values.Read this book if you're interested in pop psychology, and/or if you have trouble making decisions that don't reflect what you could've learned from experience. Enjoy the ideas Gilbert shares. But my advice for you to find happiness is to Pay Attention and Think about what you really believe in and what you really want. Stumbling isn't a good strategy no matter what.As the author says, this is not a self-help or how-to book, but a (supposedly) scientific exploration and a theory. Yet I did learn one or two things about myself that will be helpful! It's short and funny, too. So, in the end 3.5 stars, rounded up in comparison to so much other drivel out there. "
275,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652842-eric,4,"The author Dan Gilbert, is a gifted teacher and professor of social psychology at Harvard. This book is an overview of his research on affective forecasting, which examines what and how people think about their own emotions. This line of research began with the question of how accurate are people at predicting how they will respond emotionally to a variety of experiences. Not very well, it turns out. This led to an examination of the factors that lead to these fascinating mistakes that we all make in knowing our future selves. This is not a self-help book (as Dan explains early on), but rather explains what has been learned from the scientific study of our own beliefs about happiness and other emotions. This book does not pretend to explain how to become happy. It also should not be confused with the recent ""positive psychology"" movement. Rather, this book explains the process by which you arrive at the conclusion that you're happy or unhappy, and the factors that influence this conclusion. This book will help you understand, whether you're generally happy or not, why this is the case. To the extent that this book may be useful in terms of the pursuit of happiness, it may help you examine how you tend to evaluate your own emotional state, and the biases and errors we all make in drawing conclusions about our happiness. I enjoyed the beautifully written introductory chapter, as well as the quotes from Shakespeare and other classic literature at the outset of each chapter, which demonstrates that attempts to understand happiness are as old as the written word. This device was nicely juxtaposed with the discussion of contemporary cognitive and affective science, all attempting to gain traction on the fundamental human question of happiness. "
276,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"As someone who believes that happiness is a near impossibility (in addition to being overrated) I knew that the book wouldn’t come as a big surprise. Gilbert mixes psychology and cognitive sciences to show us how our brains interpolate, extrapolate, rationalize, cook up some facts and forget others, and do all sort of other tricks to put us on a never-ending and often misleading track called pursuit of happiness, while making us believe that we know what happiness is and how to reach it. Some of the facts and studies are interesting and relevant, and some less so, but after a while you get tired of the sentences that start with: “In one study, volunteers…” Towards the end of the book he presents the idea of happiness being just a meme with a really good self-replicating property, but he shies away from calling it a meme.Gilbert is a very funny guy. I liked his humor right from the first sentence of the first chapter. Anyone who thinks that cracking jokes about split infinitives is just so damn funny is fine by me. He calls himself a glutton somewhere in the book – and he ain’t joking. It’s astonishing how many of his examples and analogies involve meals whose names I don’t even know how to pronounce.Gilbert makes all those quotations from Shakespeare, and I thought he would definitely mention this quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne, which is a lot more relevant to his book, but he never did: Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
277,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919392-adam-ross,4,"A fascinating book that reveals how the human mind actively works against our own happiness. It turns out that what we think will make us happy is what actually makes us less happy, and the more we rationalize about what will make us happy, the less able we are to see what will actually make us happy. The book is an exploration in how the imagination fools us pretty much every time through mental trickery and how our projections into the future about our emotions are strongly deceptive. His solution is to look to the other for guidance; other people are experiencing in the present what we are thinking we might experience in the future, thus we need to depend on one another and trust the current experiences of other people to help guide our decisions for future choices, since any future undertaking is something someone is already experiencing in the present."
278,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"I remember reading an article about this book that made such a big impression on me that I mentioned it to Kevin on our first date in 2006. (We have now been married 10 years.) The article: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/ma... In fact, I think I said something like, ""I don't believe in happiness."" I guess I'm lucky he didn't get up and immediately sprint out. Haha. It's definitely interesting though it's been so successful throughout the years that I was aware of many of the studies already."
279,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,2,"Stumbling on Happiness is a book by Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard professor who has recently been much in the news for his work on affective forecasting. This is the study of predicting future emotional states, something that people do all the time. If you get a tattoo, you're betting that your future self will like the person whose name you've just emblazoned yourself with. People spend huge amounts of their time doing things in the interest of their future selves--think flossing, jogging, education. Unfortunately, we aren't very good at forecasting what will make us happy later.This book, therefore, is a study of how and why our predictions break down. For example, it's hard for us to put our current feelings out of our minds. We ""fill in holes in our memories of the past with material from the present,"" but we also fill in holes in the future the same way, so if we've just eaten lunch, we find it hard to think about what we want for dinner. In various ways, we lend greater emphasis on events in the near future, as well, so that we will go to greater lengths to avoid mild inconvenience in the near future than great inconvenience in the distant future. We can't put the past out of our minds even in situations when it has no ramification for the future (the sunk costs problem). And having made a decision, we spend lots of effort convincing ourselves it was a good one (which is why you might find yourself scrutinizing ads for cars after you've bought one--you want to find reasons to believe you made the right choice).The problem with this book is that despite the title, it doesn't tell you very much about happiness. I certainly was not expecting to read a book that told me how to achieve fulfillment and serenity in my life, but I also was not expecting to read two hundred-some pages about the details of various fiddly psych experiments run on undergraduates. The author, too, is amusing, but not quite as funny as he thinks he is, which makes the anecdotes and imaginings that link the experiment recaps feel like a long way to go for a wan smile.Gilbert, of course, could explain why I find the book disappointing: I read it expecting to find something like The Wisdom of Crowds, a book I really enjoyed--but my memory of The Wisdom of Crowds is flawed; I only remember the highlights of the book and fill in the missing spots in my memory with my recollection of the highlights, thus making The Wisdom of Crowds seem much better than it really was. There's probably some truth to that, so I obviously learned something here, but all the same, I felt that a long magazine article that skipped over explaining all the experimental details would have made a much better read."
280,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5950434-cara,5,"If I were to overthink this review I would probably give this book 4 stars, but apparently I will regret it less in hindsight if I go with my gut and give it 5...I enjoyed this book, it's not overly complicated, maybe it's a bit patronising, but it's more just written in simple english, which is quite refreshing compared to many books which just like to throw in that bit of wankiness so the author sounds that bit more profound. This is no self help book, just a fascinating insight (backed with lots and lots of experimental outcomes) on the strange things that the brain does in terms of making choices for the future, and the way it processes information from the past and present. Some of what was in here I was already familiar with, some of it I really wasn't, some I could have guessed the outcomes, but the supporting research as to the reasons why people do things was really interesting. It is the 'why' which is the fascinating part of this book, rather than the 'what'. People are strange, fascinating creatures, and this book is just another (although a well written, and quite amusing in parts) example of how weird and wacky we can be, often without us even knowing it..."
281,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,3,"This book is about how people naturally stink at predicting how they'll feel in the future as a result of things that will happen to them, either by their own volition or not. You think you know what'll make you happy or sad, and how much, and for how long, but chances are you're quite wrong. It's chock-full of interesting psychological experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. This is a lot of fun if you're a psychology nerd, but it's also a repetition of a lot of stuff that's taught in Psych 101. It's a good refresher, but there's no big revelation here; nothing that'll be very useful for pursuing happiness in the future. Except, that is, for Gilbert's argument that asking other people how they feel after making a move in life that you're contemplating is actually a good way to gauge how you'd feel if you did the same. It's a mildly interesting book, but i felt like it was actually aimed at someone a bit younger than myself who hasn't made a lot of big life decisions yet."
282,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1010459-b,4,"Two of the abilities that separate us from the beasties; the ability to remember the past and the ability to imagine the future; receive a thorough analysis from author Daniel Gilbert that inform us just how unreliable these faculties can be. We create illusions on a daily basis that enable us to find happiness no matter what life tosses our way. This is fascinating stuff. Much of what our senses tell us is real, much of what we remember of our past, and much of what we anticipate will be true in the future is illusionary and based upon the way we make false comparisons and illogical assumptions that, although apparent to us when pointed out by Gilbert, nonetheless still manage to confuse and mislead us. Funny, thought-provoking, and insightful, Stumbling on Happiness is a wealth of fascinating information about how our memories and foresight actually work to make us happy. "
283,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2155177-amber-lea,4,"I feel like perhaps this book deserves five stars, but since none of the content was news to me I was kind of bored.This book is mostly about psychology and brain physiology with a side of philosophy. I found it a little pretentious, but he made a solid argument about how most people have bad judgment and it's not really their fault.I learned all of this in college so this book didn't blow my mind, but I think it's worth reading if you've never studied psychology because knowing how you brain plays tricks on you can help you make better decisions."

285,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4632885-gail,5,This book doesn't tell you how to be happy as much as explain how your brain works. It has a lot of good points. Well worth reading.

287,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Gilbert is an entertaining writer, which makes this book as enjoyable as it is enlightening. He clearly states from the start that this is not a self-help book for happiness. It starts from the central notion that thinking about the future is really what makes humans unique. ""... we base these decisions [about the future] in large measure on your beliefs about how it would feel if this event happened but that one didn't."" From there Gilbert takes us on a journey exploring how our brains work. Our poorer decisions about the future usually result from our tendencies to remember how things end, how we feel in the moment, how our brains fill in the blanks in terms of memories and perception, and how unique we tend to think we are. The ridiculously simple take-away from all this is that, when possible, (view spoiler)[ you're probably better off asking others about their experience of something than trying to imagine how you'll feel about it in the future. (hide spoiler)]"
288,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12085734-saeed,2,It is far better to read Thinking Fast & Slow or Dan Ariely's books or maybe The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz instead of reading this one. This book doesn't have any recipe for the happiness and all of its contents are about something like actually how our brains are working and thinking!All of the efforts that the author puts in his book are a kind of proof for his below sentence that says:  There is no simple formula for finding happiness.

297,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Keeping it short and sweet,at the beginning of reading this book this example is what real stuck with me ""Nazi war criminal who is basking on an Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary who is being eaten alive by cannibals is""This is all you need to about this book,our so called Happiness is Subjective,we are biased at almost everything and we are not very good at picturing our future,since we tend to mix our presence and bring it to our imaginative future.lets not forget we tend to exaggerate our past experiences or real downside them,as a Dr I have seen this a couples of times whereby a pregnant woman giving birth, screaming and shouting of labour pain and swearing to never get pregnant again,only after one week she will come back,saying she thinking about getting another one.I did agree with most of what the author said on his book,this includes the even the weird points like it's more easy to forgive your sibling or elected president than a random person.All in all its a good read if you are interested in psychology,its not a self help book,on how to be happy.Despite the fact I didn't understood the implication of some of the psychology experiments and many food references but still I enjoyed reading it coz i didn't know,Human Happiness is such a controversial subject,that keeps psychologists and Philosophers awake at night."
298,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"The author of this book is a psychologist who relates various studies and habits, explaining the different ways in which our brains trick us into thinking we feel a certain way. He explains how and why our memories deceive us, why memory can differ from reality, ""optical illusions"" of the brain, and how happiness is a concept that we're never truly able to quantify. This book read more like a textbook than something you'd pick up for pleasure reading, but it was nevertheless easy to get through and interesting. I enjoyed reading his thoughts on optical illusions, explaining how the brain can be tricked, and loved the examples included about how even if you know you're being tricked, you still fall for it because our brains are imperfect. I certainly fell for the example he included in the book, despite him telling the reader beforehand that it was a trick. It really is odd to think about how many things we remember as different from actuality.One of the more memorable parts of the book, at least to me, described why certain events stick in our memories so vividly. I had never really thought in depth about many of his points before and loved the examples he included. My favorite was when he described going on a family vacation with bugs everywhere, miserable weather, etc., until one absolutely perfect day when the weather is beautiful, a gorgeous place is discovered, everyone gets along, etc. Eventually, that's all you end up remembering/reminiscing about, making the person decide to return to the same place the following year... only to be shocked by all the bugs! I just finished this book yesterday, and yet this particular chapter has already led me to have interesting conversations with others. It's fascinating to think about how good things can seem in retrospect when you're no longer actively experiencing the bad parts!I enjoyed this a lot and would easily recommend it to others. I don't think I got exactly what the title seems to suggest - the main point I came away with was not how we are happy or what truly makes us happy - but it's a more in-depth look at memories and emotions overall. This would be a perfect book to discuss with others, as it contains a lot of material that demands conversation! I'm definitely glad I read it. "
299,1400077427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Very Good--Witty, concise, and insightful, Daniel Gilbert delivers a riveting account of human frailty when it comes to memory and imagination. In summary, he argues that imagination 1) adds or removes details without us noticing (or what he calls ""Realism""), 2) imagined futures and pasts are a lot more like the present than they actually will be or they were (""Presentism""), and 3) fails to take into account significant factors such as our psychological immune system in predicting our emotional responses to certain events (""Rationalization"").The book is for the most part descriptive and not prescriptive as the author delineates certain major features of the mind and does not propose ""solutions"" or ""remedies"" to the cognitive biases that plague our minds.He does, however, refer briefly to the only way to predict our emotional responses with accuracy: to rely EXCLUSIVELY on other people's experiences. In a series of studies, people who made predictions about their own emotional responses based solely on other people's reports made more accurate predictions than those who based their predictions on their imagination.But like Daniel Gilbert warns us when he introduces this method, no one wants to use it, and it makes sense. The method, apart from the fact that it's the most accurate method of predicting our emotional responses, challenges our fundamental belief that we are somehow different from others and thus our emotional responses differ from those of randomly chosen people.While the lack of a panacea for the shortcomings of our mental faculties is unsettling and dissatisfying, their detailed and fascinating descriptions are absolutely informative and worth it."
