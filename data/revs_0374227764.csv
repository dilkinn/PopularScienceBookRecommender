0,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23067416-julie,2,"I wanted to like this book -- I really did -- but unfortunately it just didn't do much for me.First of all, my background and the book's. I studied bio with an emphasis on evolution. This book is about the evolution of octopus brains: a system only distantly linked to our own. An octopus is really the closest thing we have to a truly alien intelligence whereas mammals and birds have similar systems in play. We were a match made in heaven. I was thrilled for this book and even tried to get a friend to read it with me.Unfortunately that's where the love affair ended. The book started interestingly enough with a discussion of life in the Ediacaran (Pre-Cambrian) period. This, the author asserts, is when life started being able to sense and we got the first bits of nervous systems. Super interesting, though of course largely speculation: when looking at these fossils, most squishy things are gone. There's also questions as to why the nervous system developed in the first place. The author is a little slow in describing the more commonly known bits of evolution (i.e. vertebrates), but I also recognize that ""And then vertebrates developed as you might expect"" would be enough for me.This is where the books starts to lose structure. The author just begins discussing anecdotes of octopus behavior, but seems to just ramble without a clear goal in mind. First he discusses many experiments with octopus and many surprising anceotes from those experiments, but he largely seems to gloss over what those experiments meant or what they told us about octopus behavior or thoughts. The author recounts similar tales of wild octopus, again mainly just to demonstrate that they have higher intelligence.There's an interesting bit when the author discusses whether octopus have the same ""centralized brain"" as we do, or if it's more of a sum of its arms/parts. However the author never really goes anywhere with this. He briefly discusses a maze experiment than proves that this exists, then discusses a few more stories that indicates this exists and then... nothing. For a straight biology book this may have been acceptable, but this is biology and philosophy! What does this mean? How does that make life different for an octopus? Well, there's not any answer to that.About then, the book grinds to a screeching halt as the author ponders consciousness and it's painful. While there are some truly interesting experiments mentioned, a lot of it just gets into the navel-gazing of questioning what consciousness is. This section is nearly unreadable at times.I keep coming back to that metaphor [of consciousness as white noise] when I'm trying to get my head around this topic. It is a metaphor--very much so. It's a metaphot of sound applied to organisms that, at least in most cases, probably could not hear at all. I'm not sure why the image stays so consistently with me. Somehow it seems to point in the right direction, with its evocation of a crackle of the metabolic electricity, and the shape of the story suggested. That shape is one in which experience starts in an inchoate buzz, and becomes more organized.That paragraph does nearly nothing to advance the book. Others are virtually incomprehensible:In our own case, looking inside, we find that subjective experience has a close association with perception and control -- with using what we sense to work out what we do. Why should this be? Why shouldn't subjective experience be associated with other things? Why isn't it brimful of basic bodily rhythms, the division of cells, life itself? Some people say it is full of those things-- more than we realize anyway. I don't think so, and suspect there's a clue here. Subjective experience does not arise from the mere running of the system, but from the modulation of its state, from registering things that matter. These need not be external events; they might arise internally. But they are tracked because they matter and require a response. Sentience has some point to it. It's not just a bathing in living activity.Yeah... that paragraph needs some serious editing. A lot of these more philosophical bits are nearly unreadable. Perhaps I just lack the background, but I can't be the only one. This is from the same author who really went over the fact that vertebrate evolution happened in near boring level of clarity just a few chapters earlier.There is a super fascinating section on cuttlefish and squid and how they are able to change colors. Then, the shocking revelation that these animals are likely colorblind. The author does a wonderful job here, though admittedly our understanding is woefully incomplete. The author does a great job here and diagrams are genuinely helpful!Then there's another section, this time about the use of language in consciousness and thinking. Why was this not with the other section on the human mind? Also, why are we discussing this? The octopus and cuttlefish completely lack language... why is it in this book?This is shortly followed on speculation on aging and the octopus's short life span. This is adequate, although I found the author's explanations lacking. Again, the author went through the evolutionary tree in detail (a couple times now iirc), but really can't explain the major theory of aging in any adequate fashion.Shortly following this chapter on aging, there's a chapter on how the octopolis (a group or city of octopus) formed and then suddenly the book is over on page 204 of 255! When reading I was expecting another chapter to really wrap everything up nicely and give me the overarching picture. Nothing. Instead the rest of the book is full of notes on what the author was talking about earlier in the book. Was there any indication of these endnotes? Nope. None whatsoever. Some are clarifications, others are just sources. I read none of them because why would I read a note on something back on page 57 after I finished the book?All in all, it's not what I wanted. Perhaps it should have been titled ""Unusual octopus behavior and essays on philosophy"" and that would have been closer to the truth. Only about a third of the books is about octopus and that's really a problem considering how much it's marketed on that. I think the author missed an opportunity to really delve into octopus and mollusk evolution, but instead only talked about bilaterally symmetrical evolution and when mollusks and vertebrates split. How do you have an organism with blue-green blood, jet propulsion, three hearts, and a digestive system that passes through its brain and you fail to discuss the evolution of any of it in favor of discussing the role of language in thought?! Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense. (There may have been a slight discussion of the limbs and nerves, but definitely falling short). I was also looking for more in the way of how octopus responded differently than mammals or birds, but there wasn't much of that either.The book I got just didn't gel with the book I was promised. I don't know whether it was over-marketed, or the author wanted to say more, but lacked data. Either way, the end product was a bit of a mess. Sorry, but this was not the book for this bio major. It really didn't cover much about octopus intelligence or evolution in any way I was hoping it would....With the possible exception of the cuttlefish.I could never be mad at you."
1,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This book is explanation of our development, the evolution, from single-celled beings to the complex creatures of today. The author says that the chemistry of life is aquatic. That's why we are made of such a large volume of water with a delicate salt-balance ourselves. I knew this, but had never thought of it quite as ""the chemistry of life is sea-based"".The author is in love with octopuses and cuttlefish and describes them from observation, from laboratory anecdotes and from a scientific point of view. The most amazing thing, which I have witnessed myself but did not understand until I read this book, is that squid can be very friendly to people. Their skin, which is like a computer monitor with a million pixels that can light up in a millisecond in many colours and patterns, can also see. It is not understood how. It is also thought that molluscs are colourblind which wouldn't make any sense. So I prefer to interpret that, as does the author, the mechanism for perceiving colour in molluscs has not yet been discovered.Years ago, I was snorkelling around a very small reef and I saw a little squid, it stayed still in the water and was rapidly changing colour. So I stopped to look at it. Then it was joined by another, then another until there were about 7 of them of varying sizes from about the size of your hand up to forearm sized all in a row and all rapidly cycling colours and patterns, waves and clouds and spots and electric stripes. I called out to my bf to come and see but come slowly not to scare them. I didn't think they would stay. He swam over and by then there were about 11 squids and it was apparent to both of us that they were staring at me. They were as curious and interested in me as I was in them and they didn't go away for quite a few minutes. They were no more shy than I was and as I had called my ex, so they had 'called' each other to come and see me.Until I read this book I hadn't known that squid could be very friendly to people and were curious and interested in them, and I had indeed been right, they were checking me out in exactly the same as I was them.And therein lies the nugget at the heart of the book. The development of consciousness. Which we know nothing much about, in ourselves included. We do not know how we process thoughts. We know that we have a short term memory (much as a computer) for present tasks, that we have interior dialogues both conscious and unconscious and for some the only way to still the inner voices is by meditation. We know that all of this is evolutionary, consciousness did not start with us, but what is it, and how do we pin it down?Wonderful book, just for the explanation of development from single-celled creatures to ourselves, and for showing how evolution, how the mutation of cells is an everyday process, nothing special, just some mutations are useful and stick, and others either cause harm or just go nowhere. The writing is a bonus. It's scientific, tells stories, draws from the vocabulary of artists and above all else communicates the great enthusiasm the author has for his subject to the reader.10 stars. The book ended too soon."
2,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Octopodes, or ""the floppy floppy spider of the sea,"" (source: ZeFrank)  are pretty freaking amazing. Godfrey-Smith agrees, which is how this book came about. As he notes on page 9, ""If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of shared history...but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.""Unfortunately, he tried to marry it with one of his professional passions, the philosophy of consciousness, and that's where this falls quite short. The beginning chapters have a quick explanation of the evolutionary tree, and then start tracing the origin of life and neurons through a brief look at the fossil record. This is supposed to impress upon us how different we are from octopodes, but if you didn't already know that, I don't know how you would have selected this book. So that was weird to me. Each chapter has a teaser opener of a real-life octopus situation, then goes into theory.Julie has a very solid, thorough analysis on what went wrong, and why, and I strongly suggest it if you are wondering whether or not this is for you. I am occasionally in the mood for philosophy, but grow quickly tired of discussions of perception of pain, consciousness, and possible perception of self. To me, consciousness and pain quickly boils down to experience: I see something witness and try to escape potential pain/pain; therefore it experiences it enough that it deserves consideration, does it not? Does it actually matter if it conceives of itself as an individual? Whatever. That isn't the point: the point is that these conversations quickly grow tiresome to me because it seems the ultimate in superiority complexes, all the more ironic coming from a race that can't manage to not to destroy its own environment. And now I'm off track again. Anyways, here's what's interesting:-octopodes can recognize people. They also tend to squirt water at things they don't like. There's numerous anecdotes of them specifically targeting a person they don't like with a jet of water, or all new visitors to the lab.-the Ediacaran period had peaceful creatures that were basically like bathmats that crawled around munching and seemed to not have sophisticated sense organs or protective armament. I have no idea what this has to do with octopodes, but it's a super fun visual image. I picture a herd of bathmats grazing on my lawn.-cuttlefish are also cool, and may actually be color-blind, although they have the astonishing ability to blend with their environment.-there's a secret octopus garden on the east coast of Australia. Or in a Beatle's song. Which is awesome.There's some neat colorplate photos in here, as well as some black-and-white drawings and illustrations in an attempt to help the reader with visuals (ie., evolutionary tree, the fossil record). The end chapter where he talks about studies at Octopolis are genuinely interesting, and I would have read much more about what's coming out of there. Actually, now that I'm listening to it again, watching ZeFrank is a quicker, and more fun, and references many of the same octopus facts that were in this book."

Cross-pollination and flexibility to squeeze into other academic boxes always pleases me. So, when I discovered a book that looks at the philosophy of cognition by examining the brains and evolution of cephalopods (primarily octopuses and cuttlefish) I was excited. One reason is my love for octopuses (while almost accidental) goes back nearly ten years. For most of the time I've had an Audible account, my avatar has been an octopus. Friends buy me Cthulhu masks and plush dolls (I'm still not sure what one does long-term with a Cthulhu doll. How long can you appropriately cuddle with an Elder God doll before it becomes creepy?). Anyway, Godfrey-Smith uses the development of the cephalopod brain as a way to highlight our own brain's development and also as a way to explore different ways cognition may appear in other life forms. The unique neural patterns/structure in octopuses makes the way they see the world significantly different than the way we see the world (despite our separately evolved, but similar eyes). As Godfrey-Smith also points out -- an octopus is probably the closest we will come to examining another mind: ""If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all"" (p10). As YouTube shows, part of the appeal of octopuses is how they, for an animal so different from us (it is closer to a slug than us biologically) seems to flirt with behaviors that are both close to us (playful, clever, petty) and also completely foreign. They seem to exits in a weird uncanny valley that attracts and repels us. How can we not be fascinated by something that seems to have almost dropped her from another planet, but acts a bit like a feline? Octopuses, and their brains, reminds me of the famous Montaigne quote about his cat:When I Am Playing With My Cat, How Do I Know She Is Not Playing With Me?Indeed. When we are watching octopuses on YouTube, they seem to be equally fascinated with us. It is strange and lovely, and opens up a lot of questions about what it means to be alive, to think, to have a subjective experience. Peter Godfrey-Smith moves well along this path and asks most of the big questions I would want asked. Many answers, however, seem largely unanswerable. But like a philosopher is want, he still asks.Next up in cephalopod reading: Vampyroteuthis Infernalis: A Treatise, with a Report by the Institut Scientifique de Recherche Paranaturaliste"
4,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"Despite what might be gleaned from your Star Treks and Dr Whos, the evolution of intelligent life is – as far as I can get my head round it – infinitesimally rare and unlikely. The emergence of cells, the development of eukaryotes, the first multicellular organisms, the start of sexual reproduction, and finally some kind of freak evolutionary drive towards increased intelligence – all these things happened once only, and didn't have to. It's presumably happened somewhere else in the universe (which is a sizeable place), but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that we're the only example in the 200 billion solar systems of this galaxy.People interested in such things have spent a lot of time trying to put concrete numbers to the odds of these things happening. That last step – the development of intelligence – seems among the most unlikely, but one of the implications of this utterly fascinating book is that perhaps it isn't so unique after all. Enter – by jet propulsion – the octopus.Invertebrates are not generally known for their brainpower. But octopuses (and, to a degree, all cephalopods) are an exception. In terms of sheer neurons, they are well up there with many of the mammals – they have more neural connections than cats, for example. As Godfrey-Smith puts it, they are ‘an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals’.That does not mean that the way they think is comparable to us, though, or to your pet Persian. Although a few of an octopus's neurons are gathered into a walnut-sized ‘CPU’ of sorts, most of them are dispersed throughout their body: each of their eight arms can, in a very real sense, ‘think’ and act independently.Godfrey-Smith, though often wearing a marine biologist hat, is a philosopher by training, and he spends a lot of time here addressing the question of what it might feel like to be an octopus, without a centralised ‘self’ in the way that we understand it. I thought I would find these sections irritatingly speculative (which is my reaction to most philosophers, if I'm honest), but in fact they were so grounded in scientific data, and just so interesting, that I was more than happy to go along for the ride.Ultimately, though, the differences are perhaps less significant than the similarities. The most recent common ancestor of humans and octopuses lived upwards of five hundred million years ago, and was probably some kind of very simple worm-like thing without any neural network to speak of. That means that natural selection has, completely independently, developed complex ‘intelligence’ of some kind twice.‘Cephalopods and smart vertebrates are independent experiments in the evolution of the mind,’ Godfrey-Smith summarises. The implications are genuinely awe-inspiring. And looking at an octopus is, in all likelihood, as close to meeting an alien intelligence as we'll ever get."
5,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Cephalopods are among my favourite animal species. They are amazing and yet so much of them remains mysterious. I was thrilled to learn of this book when a friend recently reviewed it. On the TBR list it went!Peter Godfrey-Smith is a philosophy professor who spends his spare time studying cephalopods. In Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness he takes us underwater to explore these magnificent creatures and to ponder the origin of intelligence and consciousness (I know, you already got that from the title!). Because our evolutionary paths diverged so long ago - about 600 million years ago in the form of a flattened worm-like creature - we know that intelligence and consciousness evolved at least twice. What does that say about intelligence? What does that say about consciousness? Is it inevitable that life forms develop these traits? And exactly how smart are cephalopods? Mr. Godfrey-Smith explores these questions as he relates what we know about these mysterious and awesome sea creatures. A few fascinating facts about octopuses from this book:•There are around 300 known species of octopus at present•The giant Pacific octopus, the largest, weighs in at 100 pounds and can span 20 feet from arm tip to arm tip•Octopuses have blue-green blood (pumped from their three hearts) due to copper, not iron, molecules carrying oxygen•Octopuses seem to distinguish between short-term and long-term memory, as we humans do•Octopuses can squeeze through a hole as tiny as their eyeball!Then there are cuttlefish! Wow, those things are AMAZING! Aside from their apparent intelligence and curiosity of the world around them, they have the ability to change their bodies to all colours of the rainbow. Sometimes this is in patterns such as stripes, other times cloudy. They can change their entire colour scheme in less than a second! ~Australian Giant Cuttlefish by Richard Ling, Wikimedia CommonsClick here to watch a mesmerizing video of Giant Cuttlefish off the coast of NSW, Australia.If you're curious about the strange and awesome creatures which are cephalopods, you might want to pick up this book. It's both informational and philosophical, exploring what intelligence is and why it has evolved.  It is well-written, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking.  Oh, and it also has lots of cool photos! "
6,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Strangely enough, this book -- which could have turned into a free-for-all metaphysics/philosophy speculation-fest -- actually turned out to be a relatively careful, thoughtful science book that poses, but does not attempt to prove, that octopods may be the real deal.Intelligence does not need a spine. Hell, to me, this should be rather obvious.I appreciate how the old scientific prejudice and just plain annoyance with the creatures might have skewed clear thinking about squids. I also understand that very little in the way of extensive research has been done on them.But what really fascinates me is the hints at what they really could be. Their short lives notwithstanding, they seem to have perceptual powers that are astounding. Every inch of their skin seems to be hyper-aware and the chromatophores (skin pigmentation changes) are wildly expressive and responsive.What I think, and what the book is careful not to speculate on, is pretty fascinating: deep communications are going on in the visual medium. Indeed, since octopods' neural structure is across their entire bodies, we can make some really interesting suppositions. Like full-concept transmissions, learning, teaching ... perhaps even more ... between these short-lived creatures. Maybe consciousness.Me? I love this. The author doesn't take it there, but leads us to this doorstep. It's up to us to dream. :) I love dreaming. :)"
7,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"One of the best books I read this year and not one I had been planning to read. I skimmed a few reviews, which were interesting but did not leave me thinking that I needed to read the full book. But then I started a sample on a whim and was swept away by the carefully observed descriptions of octopuses (and to a lesser degree cuttlefish) and the use of that as a springboard to discuss evolutionary biology and the philosophy of the mind.Octopuses are a type of mollusk and, like all invertebrates, branched off from the stream of animals that led to humans enormously long ago--and well before the evolution of central nervous systems, eyes, or much else of any sophistication. But now octopuses have large collections of neurons, rivaling mammals, but they are evolved largely independently of ours. And they have important differences, for example most of their neurons are distributed in their arms rather than collected together in their brain. This leads Peter Godfrey-Smith to speculate about what this says about intelligence and whether we should think of body parts as having their own autonomous intelligences (in the form of reflexes or even higher order thought in octopuses). Some of the interesting speculations are about how humans benefited from the feedback loop between our sensing of our own actions (e.g., we can hear ourselves talk) while octopuses and cuttlefish can make impressive color displays but are themselves colorblind so they do not see their own displays nor do they use them to communicate with others.Towards the end the book turns poignant as Godfrey-Smith relates how this highly curious and interactive animal, the closest thing to an alien we have on earth, only lives for about two years--much less than anything else its size and intellectual sophistication. This leads into both the evolutionary biology of aging and its link to reproduction and ultimately an homage to the ocean and conservation that is less original than much of the book but powerful for how much he learned about the human mind from swimming on the bottom of the ocean."
8,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,2,"Gosh, I wasn't crazy about this. Godfrey-Smith is an Australian, Sydney native, teaching at City University in New York. He began studying octopus in 2008 by following them around in scuba gear. He is a philosopher, not a scientist. I did not grasp that when we began. There were some very un-scientific notions presented that struck me as weird ""[Cephalopods and baboons] are both partial cases, unfinished, in a sense, though one should not think of evolution as goal-directed.""I should think not. There was some other strange stuff about a gentleman who became aphasic occasionally but still had to express himself, which he did by pointing. Godfrey-Smith thought the man's aphasia 'proved' the man no longer had the capacity for language...despite the man being mentally aware and was pointing to things. Just seems a notion the author is floating that doesn't really bear scrutiny.Look, the man had some terrific times observing squid, giant cuttlefish, and octopus and has some terrific stories (and even some photos) to tell about them--the way they morph shape, texture, and color and look interested to be around humans. We learn that the cephalopods live about two years, which does seem exceptionally short, though Godfrey-Smith goes off on another philosophical tangent about why such a big-brained animal would live so short a time when the dopes of the animal kingdom live comparatively forever.Not the right questions for me. "
9,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,5,"Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, And the Deep Origins of ConsciousnessOther Minds is one of the most remarkable books I have read - ever!There is much I loved about this book, much that fascinated, intrigued, puzzled, flummoxed, and thoroughly delighted me in this wonderful treasure, but none of that would have happened without the extraordinary writing by Peter Godfrey Smith.  So I may have been drawn into the book by the title and my fascination for the octopus, but the other half of the title was equally compelling: the deep origins of consciousness. Where does our consciousness come from? How do we distinguish between mind and action? And, of course, how do our animal cousins experience it? I think we’ve all observed what we feel is consciousness in our mammal friends and certain birds – but in the lizards in my yard? In the fish (etc.) in sea? And, really, who hasn’t wished they could deeply communicate with a beloved pet or some nearby critter?  Smith regales us with delightful, startling, endearing stories of the cephalopods of the sea, primarily the octopus and the cuttle-fish in the waters around Australia. He is a marvelous story teller, a passionate diver, and in those chapters you are hardly aware of reading NF because his narrative voice is so warm, curious, observant, and illuminating. Heck, I didn’t even know what a cuttle-fish was a few years ago and now I’m thinking they are the cutest, most talented little critters to grace the sea (OK – after dolphins). Godrey-Smith describes his experiences swimming with cuttlefish, especially the giant ones. He writes:  “ A cuttlefish looks like a giant octopus attached to a hovercraft. It has a back shaped a bit like a turtle shell, a prominent head, and eight arms coming straight out of the head…This animal is three feet long with a skin that can appear just about any color at all and can change in seconds, sometimes much faster than a second. In the case of large cuttlefish, the entire body is a screen on which patterns are played. Not just a series snapshots, but moving shapes, like stripes and clouds. These seem to be immensely expressive animals, animals with a lot to say. IF SO, WHAT IS BEING SAID AND TO WHOM? And WHY? HOW DOES IT HELP THEIR SURVIVAL? Godfrey-Smith peppers the book (perhaps rather salts )generously with frequent questions, both his own and those of fellow scientists, to engage his readers in continual reflection on the topics being explored. I loved this feature of his writing, it kept my mind actively engaged and gave me the feeling of being a part of this scientific process of open inquiry. The author moves back and forth with a conversational voice that completely pulls the reader into the examination of his philosophical quest. I felt like I was enrolled in a graduate seminar, small and intimate, with a relaxed and warmly conversant professor who knew it really is all about the voyage. And he charmed me with his descriptions of diving experiences like the octopus leading him by the hand in Octopolis, that surprising community of octopuses where we can vicariously delight in their occasional power struggles of who is king of the mountain – now imagine that scenario with two eight-armed creatures! How can you not love the creative spirit of this philosopher scientist who names the cuttle-fish after artists like Matisse and Kandinsky based upon their colorful displays: The author includes both colored photos of the octopus and cuttlefish as well as simplified diagrams to help readers with less of a science background (readers like me) grasp some of his more complex explanations. I found these to be very helpful and was able to bounce back and forth between the written words and the diagrams to build a deeper understanding of new knowledge. He is a patient and able guide and I found myself laughing often at his humorous asides after a particularly complex explanation. For example, one of my favorite chapters was A History of Animals. Godfrey-Smith presents a variety of theories on how scientists formed two views of the evolution of the nervous system: ""Possibilities abound. One nervous system develops on top, and tracks light, but not as a guide to action. Instead it uses light to control bodily rhythms and regulate hormones. Another nervous system evolves to control movement, initially just the movement of the mouth. And at some stage, the two systems begin to move within the body, coming into new relationships with each other. What an amazing image: in a long evolutionary process, a motion controlling brain marches up through your head to meet there some light sensitive organs, which become eyes."" Now really, that just made me want to jump up and cheer! If you have a high tolerance for questions and uncertainty and are willing to go along on a ride of reflecting on possibilities, this book is for you.  Godfrey-Smith ends this book quietly and gently reminding us that the effects of human actions from the past two hundred years are far more hazardous and complex than even the most knowledgeable of experts has imagined them to be. Just this week I read an article on the high levels of toxins that have drifted down into the deepest areas of the Marianas Trench. We have too long held the belief that the rescources of the sea are endless, that the seas are so vast they can withstand all that we put into them; but we are learning that is not so. “The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible. All the early stages took place in the water: the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and brains, and the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.diversity and our alien cousins – the octopus and cuttle-fish. I highly recommend this engaging and thought-provoking book to all who are curious about the spectacular variety of life in our world and how we are all connected by such an insignificant percentage of DNA. Splendid!"
10,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,3,"I decided to give this a go after seeing a glowing recommendation for it in an online article. I suppose those sorts of reviews are a double-edged sword. They get you to read the book, but on the other hand the reader can start with overly high expectations, which is what happened to me in this case.The author’s starting premise is an intriguing one. The complex brains of humans and other mammals are all “variations on a theme” and arise out of differences between quite closely related species. The last common ancestor between humans and molluscs was a worm like creature about a millimetre long, which lived more than 600 million years ago, and yet the octopus also has a complex brain and nervous system. It follows that the octopus brain has developed along a separate evolutionary route, and that evolution has selected complex nervous systems more than once.In fairness the author doesn’t try to overstate his case, commenting that the nervous system of the octopus contains around 500 million neurons, compared to 100 billion in humans. We get some fun descriptions about the intelligence capabilities of octopuses, including that they can recognise individual humans. One laboratory octopus apparently took an inexplicable dislike to one of the researchers and drenched her (and only her) with jets of water whenever she passed too close to the octopus’ tank. Another worked out that lab lights could be put out by shooting jets of salt water at them, and got so good at this the octopus had to be returned to the sea (very “Finding Nemo”-ish).There was a some thought provoking stuff about the nature of consciousness, and the evolutionary basis of aging, but on the whole I felt the author was better at posing questions than delivering answers, and a fair amount of the book seemed speculative."

The attention to detail, the personal approach towards scientific stories -hard to do and well done- and the never ending exhilarating, addictive examples. The only reason it does not get five stars is the ‘other minds’ subject. There is a promise in the beginning that we will dive into another world of consciousness and intelligence with the octopi. The book -for me- does not really deliver on that promise. "

The premise:
Basically, a philosopher tries to parse out how and why cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish) developed intelligent minds when they split from all other animals we consider to have intelligent minds (e.g. vertebrates like cats, dogs, parrots, monkeys, humans, etc.) so very, very long ago. These are parallel evolutions; our minds and octopoid (it's a word) minds developed completely independent of each other. How? Why? And what does this say about what a “mind” is? Basically, octopi (yes, I know ""octopodes"" and ""octopuses"" are preferred, but fuck off, look how cute ""octopi"" is) are the closest thing we have to alien intelligence.The kind of intelligence octopi have seems, to me, to be similar to the intelligence humans have: adaptivity. For instance, octopi have been observed stealing halved coconut shells- presumably cut in half and discarded by humans. They put one half of the coconut nested inside the other half, and carry this around while moving around the ocean floor. Then when they want to- to catch prey, or for shelter- they put the coconut shells together and go inside. The ability to disassemble, carry around, and reassemble a compound shelter like that? Is there any comparable behavior in any animals other than primates? Like us, octopi play with things that are clearly not edible and have no real use, just out of curiosity. They have long and short term memory. Odds are good they have REM sleep (the sleep in which we, and other mammals, dream), since their cousins cuttlefish appear to have REM sleep (it’s still not demonstrated that octopi do though). But unlike us, they have three hearts and bluish-green blood (we use iron to carry oxygen; they use copper!), no bones or shells. I think my favourite takeaway from this book is the lasting impression you get that, although we may think of ourselves as a clearly dilineated being- one whole individual cohesive self- it is more accurate to think of ourselves as a variety of cells clumped together that coordinate their behavior, through the intake and outtake of chemicals, to perpetuate their own survival. Like the first multicellular life on earth- individual cells that got stuck together and had to learn to use their conglomeration to survive, eventually by some cells doing one biological task and other tasks assigned other tasks. 
My favourite octopus anecdote:
 lab octopi are often fed things like frozen squid, when they much prefer crab. One day, a scientist was distributing frozen squid to a row of octopi tanks one by one. When she got to the end, she turned around and went back the way she came. The octopus in the first tank had not eaten its squid, and was holding it in a clear, obvious way, and appeared to be waiting for her. As the scientist stood there, the octopus made its way across the tank to the outflow pipe, watching the scientist the whole way. Then, still watching her, it dumped the squid down the drain. "
14,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11995655-daren,5,"This is a really well planned out book, which tried to explain in thorough detail, but in ways the general public can understand a wide array of scientific research - primarily evolutionary biology, but also aspects of behavioural science - signaling, communication and a whole bunch of other things that factor into the evolution of octopus and (giant) cuttlefish - which form the largest part of this book. In passing it also deals with comparable animals (including humans), such as bees, pigeons, squid, other mollusks - but only where applicable to octopus and giant cuttlefish.The author is Australian, and for the large part is observing octopus and giant cuttlefish in the ocean near Sydney, but the experimentation and research he quotes is from much further afield. With a strong philosophy background, it does seem that the author does come up with some philosophical conclusions which seem a stretch from the direct scientific research, but almost all of this steps beyond my ability to really process at an an intelligent level. By this, I mean, that I can happily follow what I am reading, and understand each point made, but I don't form a basis in which I can challenge any of the conclusions, and probably now would only have a few scattered (probably incorrect) facts on what I have read to re-share. I read for relaxation, and enjoyed this book a lot, but I don't really retain such knowledge in the long term - I have too much other stuff taking up my limited brainpower. This if course is no criticism of the book, just my excuse for not fact-sharing in this review.5 stars - short and punchy, but constantly interesting."

That book leans heavily on this one; enough so that I recommend that to readers of this and vice versa.I must admit that I came to this with some trepidation given that it's ostensibly about consciousness and by a philosopher. Neither of those things creates an expectation of anything concrete or evidence-based. So primed with an expectation of woolly thinking on anecdotal evidence I ended up being surprised. This one is evidence-based to the core and approaches the basic questions of ""what is it like to be an octopus?"" with a great deal of hard science and observational and experimental evidence. Questions around subjective experience are obviously difficult to talk about scientifically, but if it's at all possible this is the way to do it. And along the way we get a huge helping of what exactly is known about the intelligence of octopuses and cuttlefish.One of the better science books I've read lately."

One of those intelligent books which deftly flows between science and philosophy. Godfrey-Smith is a good writer who handles complex ideas with ease. He has researched well and quotes liberally from many scientific and philosophical sources - adding his own compelling interpretations.But 3 stars rather than 4. I know I am idiosyncratic and inconsistent in my grading. In this case I really wanted to enjoy the book more than I did. It's a great topic, well written and nicely presented. The problem for me is that I'm not sure whether Godfrey Smith wanted to write a book about other minds, using the Octopus as an example - or about the Octopus and it's fascinating nature, including its highly developed nervous system. This may sound like I am being picky, but I found because it flipped between the two it was not quite as good as it could have been.Nevertheless a worthy read whether you are interested in finding out more about sea life or improving your understanding of the problem of other minds."

Godfrey-Smith takes you from the beginning of life on Earth to the present, stopping along the way to point out important developments not just in octopus consciousness, but in our own as well. You'll find charming anecdotes of octopuses outsmarting their scientist captors and giving high-fives to human divers in the wild, as well as descriptions of intriguing experiments in human and animal consciousness.In the end I'm glad I took the plunge into non-fiction.

18,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"""Other Minds"" by Peter Godfrey-Smith is an amazing, thought-provoking book that bridges science and philosophy, notably the question: 'What is consciousness? And how do you know when something is sentient?' Godfrey-Smith addresses this thorny problem by studying the 'other time' intelligence evolved on earth, notably the cephalopods. These animals, which include octopuses and cuddle fish, are intelligent, especially the octopuses. They solve complex cognitive tasks as readily as magpies and monkeys. They show adaptiveness, inventiveness and tool use. Their skins contain glands that allow them to change colors in a variety of patterns, often mimicking their surroundings to a discerning degree. And yet, for all their smarts, they seem alien to us. Because the cephalopods have a decentralized nervous system. But he does not leave us there. instead, he goes on to illustrate how we humans also have decentralized nervous systems. Though we tell ourselves inner 'stories' that make it seem like there's a ""me"" in control, much cognitive science research shows otherwise. For instance, I'll ask you to play along. Now sit still, but raise your hand whenever you want. Humans experience this as a their ""me"" deciding, after some random interval, to raise their hands. And yet MRI scans of brains show that the hand is raised BEFORE the conscious deciding parts of the brain come into action. So perhaps, octopuses aren't as alien as we think. Which leads to the flipped-around observation: the more we study human cognition, the more alien it appears. The biggest drawback to this book for me was that it meandered in places. Some of the information presented seemed to lack focus and neither strengthened the author's arguments nor rebutted contrary theories. Regardless, though, ""Other Minds"" is a great science read. Especially for people using science to explore realms 'beyond science' where scientific research can illuminate issues but can never provide answers. Like, 'is this moral,' or 'is a doc sentient?'Four stars."

21,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65154201-clare,4,"OVERALL AVERAGE RATING: 3.8Content: 4/5So last year I read The Lightkeepers by Abby Geni (excellent book by the way), and one of the things that stuck with me from that book was the octopus that one of the characters kept as a pet. Geni had described it as such an enigmatic creature that I immediately wanted to read more about them. With that said, this book was extremely detailed and informative, covering a span of topics from the evolutionary history of cephalopods to current research that’s being done on these animals. The author, a philosopher interestingly enough, also took an insightful stance on the cognitive lives of cephalopods, juxtaposing it with that of humans and other animals.Organization: 4/5Organization worked well enough. The chapters are organized into key topics, including how cephalopods evolved, how their body plan is related to their cognition, and matters regarding their lifespan. I didn’t know that most cephalopods only live up to an average of two years! There was probably one chapter in the book where the author went on a bit of a tangent about other minds and theories of consciousness but it eventually came full circle.Writing: 3.5/5I would say that the writing style probably a little dry. I’ve read nonfiction before with authors who were engaging and/or humorous storytellers so this one, unfortunately, paled in comparison in this aspect. Entertainment: 3.5/5Despite the dry writing style and the fact that this book took me an unnecessarily long time to read, I still enjoyed it overall. It certainly fulfilled my curiosity about octopuses, and gave me a new appreciation for these amazing creatures. It ended a little more sadly than I was expecting, wrapping up with a cautionary tale about the importance of preserving our oceans but the ending was perfectly appropriate."

I was absolutely enthralled by the author's discoveries made at a site he calls ""Octopolis,"" a community of octopuses on the seafloor near Sydney, Australia.One of the most interesting facets of the book to me was its explanation, in terms of existing evolutionary thought, of how and why cephalopods, animals that live a single mating cycle on average, developed the astoundingly complex signaling behaviors and apparent cognitive abilities they have. It's a wonderful and involving story.That makes this sound like a four-and-a-half star book, doesn't it? I'm not going to beat about the bush, it would have been had it not wandered waaay too far down the human-mind-brain-consciousness rabbit hole without reaching any sort of conclusion that felt solid. In the space of this book, just over 200 pages of text plus index and notes, there is no chance that this could occur. So say ""listen, there's about a bajillion petaflops of data I can't begin to pretend to digest for you, but here in 500 words is what *I* want you to know so you can see where I'm going with the parts about cephalopods.""The glossy-magazine version, in other words, would've served this book better and been less simultaneously overinforming and underrepresenting a hugely complex and contentious area of human-consciousness study. But I recommend reading the book because damn it feels good to learn about something unique from someone so warm, wise, and witty as Peter Godfrey-Smith."
24,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"[29 September 2018]This fascinating short book is about octopuses, the development of consciousness in both humans and other animals, why living creatures die, and other interesting topics. A strange mix, you think? Yes, but very well done. This is not a scientific work. The author is not a scientist, but a philosopher. However, he might also be called a naturalist, one who observes nature closely and reports on it. And he does it well. His writing style is relaxed, almost conversational, and very sympathetic. He loves him some octopuses and pulls the reader in to that fascination. But he also is very smart and thinks deeply about other topics that are tangentially related to octopuses. He makes a pretty good case for octopuses having a certain type of consciousness and describes pretty clearly how consciousness might have developed generally. His descriptions of why creatures, including man, die are a little more opaque, but still mostly make sense. Strongly recommended."

But this book does make a strong case that the octopus and the cuttlefish (Godfrey-Smith definitely has a crush on cuttlefish) are quite intelligent. And because we parted ways evolutionarily quite a long time back, he says, we can study them to understand our own path to consciousness. It sounds like the science is far from settled but he sketches out a few different theories that seem plausible and make you think more concretely about what consciousness even is. He also writes eloquently about his encounters with octopuses and cuttlefish and their interesting behaviors."
26,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24679550-ashley-c,4,"Godfrey-Smith marries his passion for octopi and other cephalopods and his expertise and work on the philosophy of consciousness in this short and readable book. It's interesting how every reader, according to the reviews I read, tackles this book from a different angle. Some are here for the cool colour-changing squid and embodied intelligence of the octopus. Some are here for the discussion of evolution. Some are here for the philosophy. I can't speak for everyone else, but for someone who's interested in an introduction and an opinion piece on the philosophy of consciousness by discussing human and non-human animal consciousness, this is a pretty solid book. 
""If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of shared history... but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.""
The idea is this: as much as we like to think we do, we don't know a hoot about consciousness, what it is, and what it isn't. Any intuitive, gut-feel opinion you have about what consciousness definitely is would not hold up once you start breaking it down. We try to learn about our own consciousness and that of animals by understanding its history ie. when we think it was formed, and by pitting the two of them at each other (much more complex than that of course but this is beyond me). From there, it leads to other relevant, practical issues, like animal ethics, and... well, all the decisions that the human society have collectively ever made based on our current understanding of consciousness. For someone who loves exactly what the author is passionate about, this would be the perfect book. Which is to say that it feels like the author wrote this mostly for himself and other enthusiasts of this particular melding of topics. There's something very inspiring reading someone's work that they wrote because they're so very interested in the subject and telling everyone about it. However, I do agree with some other commentors that this book became quite disjointed because of that. I find myself struggling to interest myself in the author's long descriptions of the scientists' findings at the Octopolis. But a small price to pay for the rest of the book.I end my review here, but I've written down some notes for myself:
""In the Ediacaran, other animals might be there around you, without being especially relevant. In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds.""""From the early Cambrian onward there was definitely predation, together with everything that predation encourages: tracking, chasing, defending... The revolution in behavior seen in the Cambrian also occurred, in large part, through the unfolding of possibilities inherent in a particular kind of body.""
Very interesting revelation here. Considering how embedded in our layman understanding or attempted justifications of morality, societal roles, and many other things is the idea that there is a natural order of how living things or animals or nature that we should somehow emulate, and how it's 'commonsense' that this natural order has always been a prey-predator set-up that is timeless, it's definitely revelatory that there was a period of time not too far removed from nature as we know it that the prey-predator system was evolved from what was once not. Surely we can use this as a learning point to examine our deep-seated beliefs on the 'natural order of things', and step away from giving this argument any sort of weight in our everyday philosophies. 
""The octopus, indeed, has a “different embodiment,” but one so unusual that it does not fit any of the standard views in this area. The usual debate is between those who see the brain as an all-powerful CEO and those who emphasize the intelligence stored in the body itself. Both views rely on a distinction between brain-based and body-based knowledge. The octopus lives outside both the usual pictures. Its embodiment prevents it from doing the sorts of things that are usually emphasized in the embodied cognition theories. The octopus, in a sense, is disembodied. That word makes it sound immaterial, which is not, of course, what I have in mind. It has a body, and is a material object. But the body itself is protean, all possibility; it has none of the costs and gains of a constraining and action-guiding body. The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide.""
Perfect summary to a great chapter Mischief And Craft. I appreciate how the author uses the octopus to present an alternative view to the two mainstream and competing schools of thought on mind-body cognition."

If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all.
 The tagline for Other Minds is: A philosopher dons a wet suit and journeys into the depths of consciousness. And that's exactly what this book is – a philosophical (so, thought experiments rather than empirically sciencey) look at consciousness, and despite the monstrous octopus dominating the cover, cephalopods are so little understood that rather than truly making them the stars of this book, author Peter Godfrey-Smith recounts what we understand about the evolution of human consciousness and then holds up the octopus as an example of “other”; we don't know how or what (or if) they think, but it's not like us. As a scuba enthusiast, Godfrey-Smith has spent a lot of time under the sea watching octopuses and cuttlefish, so this book features many beautiful pictures and eyewitness anecdotes, and there are several lab-based octopus experiments discussed, but this isn't really a book about octopuses. The bottom line is that this wasn't the book I was expecting, I wasn't entirely engaged by Godfrey-Smith's writing style, and I was often bored – but still don't regret reading it; there are enough interesting nuggets along the way.
Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. 
 After making this intriguing statement in the book's introduction, I mistakenly believed that Godfrey-Smith would then explain to me this alien mind, but he really can't – octopuses can seem curious, display novel thinking to solve problems in the lab, even recognise familiar human faces, but scientists have no idea how they do any of it. Godfrey-Smith goes over the best guesses we have about the evolution of sentience in vertebrates – from simple attract/avoid responses to stimuli, to the body/mind divide, feedback loops and afference, interior monologues as a precursor to language, etc. – and stresses there's no reason to believe that our interior experience is anything like that of the cephalopods. He cites Thomas Nagel and his seminal work 
What is it like to be a bat?
, and really, if Nagel's point was that conciousness is so subjective that humans will never understand the experience of being a related creature like a bat, for example, how could we ever hope to understand the experience of being a creature like an octopus that developed brains in a process completely independent to our own? Godfrey-Smith is constantly asking questions he can't quite answer: Octopuses and cuttlefish engage in nonstop, ever-changing, colourful displays, but are colourblind; why do they bother? Octopuses and cuttlefish only live a year or two before breeding and then suddenly dying; why invest resources into a costly large brain if it's not for a long learning curve? With most of their nervous system distributed through their tentacles – which operate without the central brain's command or even awareness – just what is the role of that central brain?In an octopus, the nervous system as a whole is a more relevant object than the brain: it's not clear where the brain itself begins and ends, and the nervous system runs all through the body. The octopus is suffused with nervousness; the body is not a separate thing that is controlled by the brain or the nervous system...the body itself is protean, all possibility; it has none of the costs and gains of a constraining and action-guiding body. The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide.Is that an answer? In the end, I suppose, it's the questions that matter most to philosophers, but I didn't find my own mind expanded by what I encountered here; and that's what matters most to me."
28,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"The mind is a complex entity, we have only scratched the surface in comprehending how it works and what it is capable of. The neural networks that make up the brain are capable of absorbing vast sums of information and making sense of them fast. The intelligence that we have, and can see in other mammals and birds, in particular, other primates, cetaceans, and corvids. There is another set of animals that seem to have also benefited from a large brain and complex neural networks and that is the cephalopods. You’ll probably know them better as cuttlefish, squid and the octopus. These are quite amazing creatures, not only are they aware of all that is going on around them, they can open jars to get the treat inside, have been known to squirt lights with jets of water as they don’t like the brightness and have been found crawling across the floors of laboratories in an escape bid. The skin operates like a high-res video screen as it is able to mimic its surroundings and ripple with colours depending on mood. They have been proven to recognise individual members of staff, even when in the same uniform, so much so that a person they took a dislike too would get drenched when they walked past.Peter Godfrey-Smith first came across them when someone introduced him to a place they had called Octopolis. This was a place that had many octopi that had brought and discarded scallop shells and begun to make it a safe haven from the predators around. There were a large number of the creatures there that seemed to tolerate each other most of the time, but every now and again there would be running battles between some of the males and Godfrey-Smith was fortunate to capture these on video. Godfrey-Smith though is a philosopher of science, not a biologist, but it got him thinking; just how had this creature had evolved down a separate branch of our shared tree and had ended up at a level of sentience which was quite advanced. The octopi that he regularly sees as he scuba dives off the coast of Sydney are willing to come up and interact with him and the other divers, It is an interesting book comparing our understanding of human consciousness with a creature that is so alien that we cannot fully get a grip on what it is thinking. There is a lot on the biological makeup of cephalopods and how their brain and nervous system works, as well as a couple of chapters on the evolution of consciousness and how the need to be aware of your surroundings has driven the development of the brain. I would have liked to read more about the observations that they had conducted on Octopolis as the chapters that were there were fascinating. Definitely worth reading for those that have an interest in marine ecology and peering into the dark recesses of the mind."
29,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510665-steven-peck,4,"A fantastic look at one of Earth's alien creatures. The book was strong on the evolution of consciousness and cephalopods. The author whose work I am familiar with from philosophy of science stuck to the science and did not speculate much beyond. I sort of wish he had. I think a more speculative chapter would have been fascinating given the author's background--especially on the origin of, say, qualia. The author's experiences with this group of animals was especially interesting and it was nice to see a philosopher in the water with this subjects. In a late chapter, he wanders from the subject with a look at senescence which if you don't know anything about it is worth reading, but as a biologist I thought the chapter a distraction from his main exploration of consciousness. Overall well worth the read, and I might come back to this a time or two. "
30,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius,5,"This was a marvelous book, I enjoyed every page, regreted that it was going so fast and I learned so much from it in such an enjoyable fashion!The title and subtitle very accurately lay out it's contents: It explores the mental worlds of Octopus and other Cephalopods, their intelligence, how they might think, what the internal and external worlds of an animal so different to us might look like.I read a lot of marine books, anything to do with Cephalopod's in particular I seek out, this book is one that I found quite exceptionally unique among those I have read. This unusual element I think, can be traced to the fact that the author is a professor of philosophy who has done a lot of scuba diving (I can't describe how jealous I am over all the time he has spend diving Octopolis is New South Wales). And so, as a philosopher, hanging out with marine biologists, observing one of the most amazing animals in the ocean, the book as well as it's subjects, is unique.The first part of the book tells us a little about the evolution of animals from non-complex forms of life to complex, it describes the early ammonites and belemnites and their descendants, who having ditched the huge shells, became the relatively unprotected octopus and cuttlefish of the modern seas. This was all well written and interesting, interspersed as it was with octopus stories it was lovely to read, but not startlingly new to me. Having a marine biology degree this was more of a refresher for the parts of evolution relevant to the story of octopus that was being told. Though the way in which it was told was fascinating.Later in the book however, when the author addresses colours? That was a brilliant (pun fully intended) section, there was so much new information and the author brings together beautifully all the small bits of research relevant to the points he is making about octopus intelligence. Anyone who has every marveled at the amazing colour changes and displays of octopus or giant cuttlefish should read this section, I can't imagine it better described.I think that part of what makes this book so spectacular, at least to a cephalopod nerd like myself, is the beauty and clarity with which it is written. There is all the unfussy clarity and accuracy of an academic for the information, the enthusiasm and the anecdotes of a diver mixed in with the unique perspectives of the philosopher. The last portion of the book, where the exploration of 'minds' really takes place was the most complicated reading for me, I have read a little psychology, and ethics philosophy but not that much or that recently. Again, the author draws from diverse writings relevant to development of 'mind' and then ties it all in to what we know, or think we know about octopus and cuttlefish.All in all, a marvelous book. I was in equal parts dismayed and delighted at it's end, I wanted more but the ending was a natural one. This is a book I will definitely re-read, in total and in parts. Also the academically precise notes give me a whole list of further reading, if I can get my hands on any of them."
31,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"The author's primary goal is examining how evolutionary biology might contribute to our understanding of consciousness. This examination combines scientific observation with philosophical theorizing, and it is not always easy to follow.I found the first four chapters fascinating. The narrative starts with single cells, perhaps 700 million years ago, hovering in a water column. Their proximity might be conducive to a sensing of surrounding cells. How did these single cells unite to form multicellular organisms?  “Most likely, the origin of animals did not stem from a meeting between lone cells who drifted together. Rather, animals arose from a cell whose daughters did not separate properly during cell division.” (p.29)Godfrey-Smith writes in an academic style, although he avoids the pitfall of littering his prose with technical jargon. Typically, he poses a question, provides a reasonable and widely held hypothesis, points out flaws, and offers alternative hypotheses. He does this when he offers up a proto-comb jelly rather than the sponge as the earliest branch of multicellular organism.  “Again we start with a clump of cells, but then imagine that this clump folds into a filmy globe-like form, swims in a simple rhythm as it lives suspended in the water column. The evolution of animals proceeds from there — from a hovering ghost-like mother, rather than a wriggling sponge larva who refused to settle down.” (p.21)Godfrey-Smith moves on to question the familiar model of the sensory system as a means for motor control (the sensory-motor model) He points out that motor control is not a simple matter, but a complex system of micro-actions that need to occur in sequence. Coordination, not merely stimulus and response needs to occur. He calls this the action-shaping view of the nervous system.Conceptual distinctions like this fill this book. They are important questions, but often interrupt the evolutionary narrative Godfrey-Smith is telling at the same time. Just when and how these complexities evolved are only vaguely tied to the transition between two contrasting periods. Life in the Ediacaren Period lasting from 635 to 542 million years ago consisted of passive organisms grazing on an undersea carpet of vegetation. In the next period, the Cambrian, there was an unaccounted for explosion of differentiated organisms with a variety of body types. More important, there is evidence of sensory development designed for predation and defense: antennae, shells, claws, and what biologist Andrew Parker believes was the most significant development, eyes.One of the most interesting concepts examined is that of perceptual constancy. We view an object from multiple angles and from multiple distances. We interpret these as images of the same object. In order to do this, we need to have a sense of self that's different from the external world. He gives an example of a fish sending out electrical pulses.  “The self-produced pulses will affect their own senses, though, and it may be difficult for a fish to distinguish the pulses it has made from electrical disturbances that are due to external things. To deal with this problem, whenever a fish emits a pulse it also sends a copy of the command around to the sensing system, enabling that system to counteract the effect of the pulse it has produced.” (p.83) Implicitly there is the faintest hint of memory. There is an on-going dialogue comparing a perception a nano-second before and a perception of now. This will be the foundation of consciousness.By now, the reader will be wondering, what about the octopus? The octopus and its relatives the squid and the cuttlefish are almost incidental characters in this evolutionary drama. Readers interested solely in these animals should focus on chapters 3 (“Mischief and Craft”), chapter 5 (“Making Colors”), and chapter 8 (Octopolis). A series of color photographs are included at the end of the book as well. While reading this book I was struck by how interesting Godfrey-Smith's behavioral observations were. They are a reminder that often the most interesting questions and hypotheses arise from observation rather than experiment. In these chapters, the curiosity and potential of these mysterious animals was captured most vividly. He concludes that because of their short life spans and inability to use their color changes as a communication tool, the cephalopods lead lives of circumscribed possibilities. Were they to think about this, they might say the same of us: circumscribed by our lungs and goal-oriented ambitions, we will never experience the wonders of the sea in the same way they do.

The joins between the two are pretty seamless, so they lead into one another and contribute to one another — if you hate philosophy, this would probably still be okay for you, because it does lean a little toward the science end. To my mind, anyway. If you don’t have a strong grounding in either, it’s still accessible and fascinating, as long as you have some level of interest in the subject.What we know about cuttlefish and octopus minds is just astounding — their intelligence is almost uncanny, and yet we know very little about how they experience the world. There were a few surprises here for me — their typically short lives, their decentralised control of movement, the seeming personalities of the animals the author observed…There’s a lot of anecdotes and such, so if you’re looking for hard science, this isn’t really what you want. But if you’re casually interested, then I recommend it. And if you can end it without wanting to dive and meet some cuttlefish and octopi for yourself, you must be made of stone. (Not really, but. I’m left so curious! That’s a thing I love in a book.)Originally posted on breathesbooks.com."

It touches on psychology, physiology, biology, and evolution. I was inspired to ask questions about topics which I'd yet to think deeply upon.A couple of warnings:1) If you are disturbed by depictions of animals being harmed, there is a brief section in here that speaks about experiments performed on animals. Some may find this upsetting to read, but it is a very tiny portion.2) If you only have a Kindle Paperwhite or original Kindle, be aware that this contains some lovely color photos (in the middle in the dead-tree, at the back in the digital). I simply pulled up the photos on a Kindle app on my phone, but this should be a factor to consider when deciding which format you want.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway.

34,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam,5,"Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.I've always found them creepy, but I didn't realize the octopus was so fascinating. Consider: The most famous octopus anecdotes are tales of escape and thievery, in which octopuses in aquariums raid neighboring tanks at night for food. Those stories, despite their charm, are not especially indicative of high intelligence. Neighboring tanks are not so different from tide pools, even though the entrance and exit take more effort. Here is a behavior I find more intriguing. Octopuses in at least two aquariums have learned to turn off the lights by squirting jets of water at the bulbs when no one is watching, and short-circuiting the power supply. At the University of Otago in New Zealand, this became so expensive that the octopus had to be released back to the wild. A lab in Germany had the same problem. This seems very smart indeed. However, one can also sketch an explanation which may partially deflate the story. Octopuses don’t like bright lights, and they squirt jets of water at all sorts of things that annoy them (as Peter Dews discovered). ...This case illustrates a more general fact: octopuses have an ability to adapt to the special circumstances of captivity and their interaction with human keepers. Octopuses in the wild are fairly solitary animals. Their social life, in most species, is thought to be minimal (though later I’ll look at exceptions to this pattern). In the lab, however, they are often quick to get the hang of how life works in their new circumstances. For example, it has long appeared that captive octopuses can recognize and behave differently toward individual human keepers. Stories of this kind have been coming out of different labs for years. Initially it all seemed anecdotal. In the same lab in New Zealand that had the “lights-out” problem, an octopus took a dislike to one member of the lab staff, for no obvious reason, and whenever that person passed by on the walkway behind the tank she received a jet of half a gallon of water in the back of her neck. Shelley Adamo, of Dalhousie University, had one cuttlefish who reliably squirted streams of water at all new visitors to the lab, and not at people who were often around. In 2010, an experiment confirmed that giant Pacific octopuses can indeed recognize individual humans, and can do this even when the humans are wearing identical uniforms.Stefan Linquist, a philosopher who once studied octopus behavior in the lab, puts it like this: “When you work with fish, they have no idea they are in a tank, somewhere unnatural. With octopuses it is totally different. They know that they are inside this special place, and you are outside it. All their behaviors are affected by their awareness of captivity.” Linquist’s octopuses would mess around with their tank, manipulating and testing it. Linquist had a problem with octopuses deliberately plugging the outflow valves on the tanks by poking in their arms, perhaps to increase the water level. Of course, this flooded the entire lab.Another tale that illustrates Linquist’s point was told to me by Jean Boal, of Millersville University in Pennsylvania. Boal has a reputation as one of the most rigorous and critical of cephalopod researchers. She is known for her meticulous experimental designs, and her insistence that “cognition” or “thought” in these animals should be hypothesized only when experimental results cannot be explained in any simpler way. But like many researchers, she has a few tales of behaviors that are baffling in what they seem to show about the inner lives of these animals. One of these incidents has stayed in her mind for over a decade. Octopuses love to eat crabs, but in the lab they are often fed on thawed-out frozen shrimp or squid. It takes octopuses a while to get used to these second-rate foods, but eventually they do. One day Boal was walking down a row of tanks, feeding each octopus a piece of thawed squid as she passed. On reaching the end of the row, she walked back the way she’d come. The octopus in the first tank, though, seemed to be waiting for her. It had not eaten its squid, but instead was holding it conspicuously. As Boal stood there, the octopus made its way slowly across the tank toward the outflow pipe, watching her all the way. When it reached the outflow pipe, still watching her, it dumped the scrap of squid down the drain. Godfrey-Smith uses his own fascination with the octopus to ask questions about human consciousness and communication.Interesting bits:(view spoiler)[When biologists look at a bird, a mammal, even a fish, they are able to map many parts of one animal’s brain onto another’s. Vertebrate brains all have a common architecture. When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets—or rather, all mappings—are off. There is no part-by-part correspondence between the parts of their brains and ours. Indeed, octopuses have not even collected the majority of their neurons inside their brains; most of the neurons are found in their arms. Given all this, the way to work out how smart octopuses are is to look at what they can do.

Once at a site close to this one, an octopus grabbed his hand and walked off with him in tow. Matt followed, as if he were being led across the sea floor by a very small eight-legged child. The tour went on for ten minutes, and ended at the octopus’s den. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[To use an older term, if it feels like something to be a squid or octopus, then these are sentient beings. Sentience comes before consciousness. Where does sentience come from?It’s not a soul-like substance that is somehow added to the physical world, as dualists think. Nor is it something that pervades all of nature, as panpsychists believe. Sentience is brought into being somehow from the evolution of sensing and acting; it involves being a living system with a point of view on the world around it. If we take that approach, though, a perplexity we run into immediately is the fact that those capacities are so widespread—they are found far outside the organisms that are usually thought to have experience of some kind.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ Octopus skin itself can both sense light and also produce a response that affects the skin’s color. ... What could it be like to see with your skin? There could be no focusing of an image. Only general changes and washes of light could be detected. We don’t yet know whether the skin’s sensing is communicated to the brain, or whether the information remains local. Both possibilities stretch the imagination. If the skin’s sensing is carried to the brain, then the animal’s visual sensitivity would extend in all directions, beyond where the eyes can reach. If the skin’s sensing does not reach the brain, then each arm might see for itself, and keep what it sees to itself.The Ramirez and Oakley finding is an important development, but it does not yet solve the problem I emphasized above, the problem of color perception. The photoreceptor in the skin of Ramirez and Oakley’s octopuses is sensitive to the same wavelengths as the photoreceptor in the eye. Even if the whole body can see, it seems that it must be seeing in monochrome. The problem of color match remains. I suspect, though, that the Ramirez work will lead to a resolution of this problem. A hint was offered in the older paper by Mäthger and her colleagues. They noted that even if the photoreceptors in the skin are chemically the same as the ones in the eye, their light sensing might be modulated by the chromatophores, or other cells, around them. This might permit one kind of photoreceptor to behave like two. Some butterflies use a similar trick. ... Suppose that by changing its colors a cephalopod affects the light that reaches sensors within its skin. Then some of these ongoing low-level color changes might be a way of surveying the chromatic environment. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[Ordinary speech functions both as input and as output. Hearing provides the mind with input; our speech is an output. We both speak and hear, and we can hear what we say. Even talking to yourself out loud can be a useful way of approaching a problem. I’ll now tie these familiar facts to a concept that has become increasingly important in the brain sciences: the concept of an efference copy. (The word efference here means the same thing as output, or action.) The best way to introduce the idea is through the example of vision.When you move your head or shift your gaze, the image on your retina continually changes, but this is not perceived as a change in the objects around you. You continually compensate for your own eye movements, so when something does move in the environment, you register it. This requires that you keep track of your own decisions to act. With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command” of some sort to your muscles, you also send a When you move your head or shift your gaze, the image on your retina continually changes, but this is not perceived as a change in the objects around you. You continually compensate for your own eye movements, so when something does move in the environment, you register it. This requires that you keep track of your own decisions to act. With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command” of some sort to your muscles, you also send a faint image of the same command (a “copy” of it, in a rough sense of that term) to the part of the brain that deals with visual input. This enables that part to take into account what your own motions are doing. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[The sounds we cook up in our heads, including the sounds of words, are broadcast in our minds in something like the way that many ordinary perceptual experiences are broadcast. Once a sentence of inner speech is composed, it is exposed to the same sort of processing that would apply to a sentence we hear. A novel combination of ideas, or an exhortation to act, is thus made available for consideration; it can have the same sort of effect that an ordinary spoken sentence can have.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[When you write something down in order to remind yourself to finish a job later, you are making a mark that your later self will sense—something you’ll perceive. In that respect it’s like the sexton and Revere. But that mark was made by your present self to get your later self to do something that completes a task. In that respect it’s like the internal coordination of activities—action shaping—even though the coordination makes use of a causal loop that runs through the external world. The coordination involves making a mark that will later be sensed.Some of these useful loops run outside the skin, and some run inside. Efference copies are internal messages, activity in the nervous system. When you move your head and the world seems to remain still, that is achieved by internal means. Here an internal message is used to solve a problem that arises from the effect of action on sensing. But these internal arcs, like the external ones, can also provide opportunities and novel resources. That is how things look within the model I gave earlier for the origins of inner speech. Copies of things you plan to say can give rise to silent actions of their own—inner actions that raise possibilities, put ideas together, and exert self-control. Inner speech can feel a bit like reafference—like the result of an action that affects your senses—but inner speech is confined inside, hence not really heard (at least when things are working as they should). If inner speech is a kind of broadcasting of information in the brain, it resembles the loop of reafference seen when you talk aloud to yourself or write notes to yourself. But this time the loop is tighter and more confined, invisible rather than public, a field for free and silent experiment.When we see the human mind as the locus of countless loops of this kind, it gives us a different perspective on our own lives and those of other animals. This includes the cephalopods discussed in this book. Their expressive medium, colors and patterns, does not lend itself to complex loops. (That’s true even setting aside the ironies associated with their alleged color-blindness.) Making skin patterns, no matter how complicated they might be, is more of a one-way street. The animal can’t see its own patterns in the way a person can hear what they say. There’s probably not much role for efference copies that involve skin patterns (unless some speculative theories of the role of chromatophores in skin sensing are correct). Cephalopod displays have enormous expressive power, but as long as we’re looking at a single animal, rather than a pair or a group, these displays are not embedded in a lot of looping feedback, and perhaps could never be. The human case—an extreme case—suggests that the opportunities associated with reafference help to drive the evolution of a more complicated mind. Cephalopods are on a different road.And this is not the only aspect of cephalopod life that circumscribes their possibilities. (hide spoiler)]"

So I was a bit disappointed to see that it was mainly about octopuses and cephelopods. Though the focus was on them, the philosophical discussions it offered was novel and arguably universal. So I was eventually satisfied."
37,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"Every Internet user past 2009 has seen the video of the octopus carrying a coconut shell around. It delighted viewers and, according to the various captions and Buzzfeed article titles, stunned scientists. I've been intrigued by octopuses and squids since I was a young boy and particularly pleased to see them occupy a bigger space in animal behavior studies lately, so this title was right up my alley.This is a book about convergent evolution—that is, the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages. Consider flight: bats do it, and birds do it too, but in each species the talent arose separately. Now consider the mind. People have one. Octopuses seem to. They arose separately. So what can we learn by examining this weird and wild quirk of evolution? Philosopher and self-proclaimed ""cephalopod-inclined hobbyist"" Peter Godfrey-Smith takes us on an exploration of consciousness and sentience found in as alien a creature as you're likely to find sharing planet Earth. It's a really interesting topic brought out of the dusty realm of the thought experiment and into the real world, combining Biology with Philosophy. First we get a quick and dirty explanation of evolutionary processes. Then the author moves further into the exploration of sentience, gently scolding Tom Nagel for asking what it is like to be a bat—the ""like"" in that question is confusing and misleading, he maintains, as it locks us into comparing ourselves to something else. Instead he wants to know not what is it LIKE, but more purely: What IS IT to be a bat an octopus? Then the whole thing is capped off by an interesting look at aging from an evolutionary point of view and a lot about cephalopod behavior and oceanic ecology.4 stars out of 5. Engaging and even exciting at times, written with flair and occasional but understated good humor and wit. My only complaint is the overtly academic writing tendency to refer to what will be talked about in a future chapter and to ask us to recall what was talked about in an earlier chapter."

It proved to be a fascinating mix of ‘stuff of about cephalopods’ and philosophical musings that suited me quite nicely.

The truth is I didn’t like it and sometimes I felt like it dragged over and over and went into many different directions that made no sense, so I thought of abandoning many times. However, I am not sure if it was because of the audiobook format (I’ve listen to two audiobooks over the past weeks and my experience has been quite meh, to say the least), or that I was misled by its cover –I was expecting a book about octopuses and their ‘intelligence’ and I got a random mix of biology, psychology, philosophy and environmental issues. Prior to starting this book, I did not read the caption, and I just went with the title and the idea of learning of the level of consciousness of these cephalopods –I thought there were going to be descriptions of real cases of interactions between humans and octopuses… and well, the truth is that there is very little of it. This book is more of an essay of how consciousness evolved in some species deep in the ocean and how it might be linked to our own evolution? I am not even sure. My attention was lost in many parts. It’s just like… honestly, I am not interested on philosophy or consciousness and I was looking forward to descriptions of experiences with these peculiar animals. My curiosity was not filled but that does not mean the book is bad –it was simply of a theme that does not interest me. ____Creo que mi calificación que di a este libro puede no ser totalmente justa. La realidad es que no me gustó y en muchas ocasiones sentí que ahondaba demasiado en muchos detalles e iba en distintas direcciones, lo cual me hizo pensar abandonar la lectura. Sin embargo, aquí es donde no estoy segura si fue el formato en audiolibro (las últimas semanas he leído varios así y en general me han parecido mediocres) o que me engañó la portada, porque estaba esperando un libro sobre los pulpos y su inteligencia y lo que obtuve fue una mezcla de psicología, biología, filosofía y temas ambientales. La cuestión es que no leí la sinopsis del libro y me dejé ir con la idea del título y de aprender algo sobre el nivel de conciencia de estos cefalópodos –pensé que encontraría descripciones de casos reales de interacciones entre pulpos y humanos. La realidad es que el libro no se trata de esto y es más un ensayo sobre la evolución de la conciencia en algunas especies de las aguas profundas y cómo ello se vincula a la propia evolución de la conciencia subjetiva humana. ¿Creo? En verdad que no estoy muy segura ya que en muchas secciones me distraje. Honestamente, no estoy interesada en temas de filosofía o conciencia y lo que yo quería era descripciones de experiencias con estos animales peculiares. Por lo tanto, mi curiosidad no fue satisfecha, si bien esto no significa que el libro sea malo –era, sencillamente, de un tema que no me interesaba."
43,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"I enjoyed this book, as I find modern science is learning more and more about the intelligent behavior of animals. I also learned a lot about the lives of cephalopods, some of which was quite surprising:* most octopuses only live a couple of years; a female reaches maturity, mates, hatches a brood and then dies, often in a matter of months* speaking of mating: the male octopus or cuttlefish literally hands over his sperm in tiny packages (spermatophores), placing it in a notch in the female, where she can break it later to fertilize her eggs! (Who knew?)* the nervous system of cephalopods is distributed throughout their bodies, and their limbs are semi-autonomous* these creatures have various skin layers, some of which are sensitive to light and colors that they sense and display back in ways which are not entirely clear. It may be a form of subtle communication, but the author has even noticed cephalopods talking/coloring to themselves...What was somewhat disappointing, was the lack of discussion about the nature and ""deep origins"" of consciousness. Although the author spent some time outlining the evolution of cephalopods, and how their nervous systems and brains may be akin to other species, such as ours, I had hoped he would have talked more about the nature of consciousness itself. Other than some interesting discussion of sensation and the nervous system, that headlined topic really wasn't delved into to the degree I was hoping, especially as Godfrey-Smith is primarily a philosopher rather than a biologist. The latter tend to get hung up on consciousness as an epi-effect of the brain and nervous system, so I was hoping for more philosophical insight on the nature of thought, even if from the difficult to know perspective of an octopus.All things considered, a good, interesting read!"
44,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"A delightful fun book. How much do you know about octopuses? Beyond Sponge Bob and the Beatles I knew relatively little about them. Did you know they are quite intelligent? Well, they are, but in a way quite different than you would expect from a dog or a dolphin. And that is the point of thoroughly intriguing book from Peter Godfrey-Smith. The book starts as it should at the beginning, about 600 million years ago. It was a time known as the ediacaran period, that stretch of millions of years before the cambrian explosion. During this period all the animals were soft, so fossils are rare and indistinct, but there is evidence that the line that would become mollusks had already split from the line that would become humans and all fellow creatures with spines. The cambrian ""explosion"" appears in the fossil record as a ""sudden"" dramatic change mainly because during this period life developed shells and other solid structures making the fossils much more distinct. For a period of time it appears that mollusks pretty much ruled the oceans. He actually starts earlier, and follows bacteria to form colonies, and sponges, and finally true multi-cellular beings. Yup, both humans and octopuses are both true multi-cellular beings, but that is about all we have in common because everything after that came along differently. He writes about the role of the nervous system as it evolves with and beside other structures of the body. Larger multi-celled animals need a nervous system to operate.He then switches gears and spends a good part of the book telling stories about his research on octopuses as well as squid, cuttlefish, and a few other related creatures. He did a lot of observations at ""Octopolis"" a place off the coast of Australia where a large number of octopuses live in close proximity, marked by a large collection of discarded shells. (Absolutely no mention of why they didn't name this place the ""Octopus's Garden"") He tells a lot of stories of caring for octopuses in laboratory tanks. They can recognize new visitors to the lab even when they all wear the same uniform! They clearly understand that they are in an aquarium, and understand there are things going on outside the aquarium. The stories imply not only that the creatures are smart, but that they as ""sneaky"". They seem to know whether you are paying attention to them or not, and they tend to sneak away just when you are not looking.Their bodies are very very different than those of vertebrates. The skin not only changes color, but also can change its shape and consistency. The ability to camouflage is spectacular. How does it figure all this out?Their brains are not like out brains though. Instead of a single centralized unit in the head, their brain appears to be more distributed through the body, and especially in the tentacles which is after all where they probably need most of the smarts anyway if it is involved in camouflage and manipulating things.Octopuses and squid have eyes that are surprisingly similar to human eyes, but they clearly evolved completely separately, and they have notable structural differences. They only have one kind of photo receptor implying that they only see black and white. Cuttlefish put on dramatic, colorful displays to each other and what use could this be if they can only see black and white? What I found amazing is that they also have the photoreceptors in their skin. Furthermore, the skin pigmentation cells (chromatophores) used for camouflage and sending flashy displays might also work together with these photoreceptors to get a sense of the color around them. In chapter 6 Godfrey-Smith is finally ready to discuss what all this might mean for consciousness. He puts forward that human language and human consciousness is very auditory in nature. The ""inner voice"" (a.k.a. system 2, the logical reasoning part of consciousness) seems to work linearly in the way that a spoken language does. This would clearly have a large effect on the type of consciousness you have. What if, instead of vocal chords, the brain is wired directly to a video screen to transmit video images to others around you? This would surely make for a form of consciousness that might be entirely different from those of all vertebrates. He can't make any conclusions for sure of what the fundamental elements of that consciousness might be, but just the contemplation of it is interesting. Then comes a chapter on one tragic aspect of octopus existence: they live a very short life: 2 to 4 years. Many species have a single cycle of spawning. Then their bodies fall apart. We normally think of intelligence being a bigger benefit to animals that live longer because the high cost of learning can pay out benefit over a longer period. For such high intelligence, they have so little time to learn things. He closes the book with more stories of Octopolis and his concerns about how the changes in the world climate and CO2 levels pose threats to these ecosystems that support these delicate creatures. He is no flaming eco-warrior, however one who loves nature enough to dedicate years to the study of such an illusive animal can not help but be concerned about the obvious destruction that we see going on in the sea. Usually, the bigger, smarter animals at the top of the food chain are the most disrupted by ecosystem changes. The loss of these animals would be a great loss indeed.Overall, it was to me a new and interesting topic one, easy to read, and one that will probably inform many related thoughts in years to come. While the speculation on consciousness forms a central subject in this book, it does not dominate it. Most of the pleasure of reading this book just comes from discovering what different and unusual creatures these amazing animals are."
45,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,4,"I enjoyed myself quite a bit with this book, although I didn't buy into everything that was discussed. It went over the evolution of the Cephalopod branch and how they developed on a totally different time scale and path than did other 'intelligent' species on this planet. It was discovered only fairly recently that birds and dolphins and elephants have a sense of self. There have been many tests to discover just how 'intelligent' those species are, and the results have been remarkable. Dolphins have their own language, we sort of knew this already, but the extent of their language includes individual names. We are hoping that we'll ""crack the language"" using computers and other tech to help us along within the next couple decades. Wouldn't that be cool as shit, talk to the dolphins! Similarly, Elephants have shown to be much more vocal than we had thought previously, probably because half of their vocalizations occur on lower wavelengths we can't hear. Research has taken many steps in positive directions when it comes to animal welfare, rights, and treatment while they are being used for study and research. We now have protection for all animals with a backbone... but unfortunately this does not extend to invertebrates. Even that's beginning to change though and that's great because it's been shown that the Octopus and Cuttlefish are just as smart as Jays/Crows and probably on par with dogs. It's not okay to electroshock them, to cut off arms and see what happens, to drill into their brains with no anesthetic. Some countries have already taken steps to banning this sort of research, we're just waiting on the rest to catch up with the times. This guy is really more of a philosopher with science in his background, the book had a lot of speculation and anecdotal evidence which is fine and interesting - just be aware of it before you buy it. As stated before, I didn't totally buy everything since some of it was just speculation with no studies to back it up. However, most scientific research starts with speculation - look at this, isn't that neat? I wonder if it's because of XYZ? The philosophical aspects also allowed for more interesting range of topics with less rules and more rigid topic structure which you find with many non fiction science books. This guy has a passion for his topic of study, and that's what I enjoyed most. He really loves Octopi and is advocating for their treatment and welfare to be as humane as possible. We need more people like this speaking out for those that can't speak for themselves. Who would want to live their lives being poked, prodded, and cut apart with no medicine to dull the pain? "
46,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,3,"I have spent most of my day telling everyone within earshot all my new octofacts. I love them. I love octopuses. They are so smart and fascinating and bratty and symbolically excellent (they exemplify possibility and exploration, in physical and cognitive form!! COME ON), and also very cute. Just google ""baby octopus,"" like I spent the other part of my day doing. I will never eat octopus (or any other cephalopod) again :( So for octopus-love-creating I give this book 10 out of 5 stars, good job and well done and I would like three octopus tattoos thank you.However, for actual book merit: some issues. Pros: - massively engaging, particularly for a non-fiction book. Like, this may just have been my new obsession driving me forward, but I blew through it in less than a day. Super readable, and very interesting.- Godfrey-Smith makes some interesting hints at points about consciousness.Cons:- Godfrey-Smith doesn't really make any actual points about consciousness.- The book mostly hinges on Godfrey-Smith's individual encounters with particular species of octopus & cuttlefish. The conclusions he does draw rely heavily on his firsthand experiences with them, and while the anecdotes are interesting, like, they're just kinda tra-la-la anecdotes about his own deep-sea diving. Cool, but y'know.- It seemed short. I actually sad-gasped when I realized how close I was to finishing. I wanted so much more information about my new best ceph-riends, though maybe that information doesn't exist yet. Still, I feel that things were strangely organized, a lot of rambling with little nuggets of information, and the whole thing just felt incomplete at the end. This might have been ameliorated with a conclusion other than ""we keep developing neural networks across evolutionary experiments."" Okay, but that feels like the start of the book rather than the end.- Maybe I just want a sequel. But can that one be about octopuses too, please?In conclusion,  ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"
47,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8618881-jamie-erin,3,"My inclination is to rate this book with 3 stars. I don't feel compelled to rate it more highly because for me, much of it (a full 50 percent) was a slog: I persevered through the drawn-out, somewhat sloppily organized philosophical delvings into the evolution of large nervous systems so that I could read another fascinating account of interactions with cephalopods. And Godfrey-Smith has some of the best anecdotes about cephalopod behavior that I've read. In addition, he has an endearing (and relatable) passion for and interest in these semi-alien animals. It was his excitement and first-hand experience with these creatures that drew me forward.I need to point out, however, that I didn't read the full description of the book before diving in. I saw that it was about cephalopods, which have piqued my interest with their evident curiosity and intelligence at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I figured I'd enjoy learning more about their behaviors. As the description clearly says, however (and as I therefore should have known), this is a book that uses cephalopods to approach questions of sentience and evolutionary development in all creatures. I could find this interesting on a limited scale, but not to the depth and length given it by Other Minds. I also felt that the organization of all of the material (philosophical, scientific, and observational) could have been improved with some deep editing. I enjoy both philosophy and science, but more than once Godfrey-Smith seemed to be ""thinking out loud,"" and basically developing his theories over the course of the book. I felt like I was reading his personal diary in which he painstakingly worked out the questions and potential answers about the development of consciousness and the brain.Would I recommend this book to someone who, like me, wants to learn more about cephalopods? No, unless a reader is willing to skip around to get to the most interesting and revealing sections."
48,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,3,"This book has an interesting premise--octopi and their close relatives, unlike all other semi-intelligent beings (such as birds, whales, dolphins, pigs, and apes, etc.), diverged so early that their intelligence is less a variant on our own (like the aforementioned ape and pig intelligence) than a sui generis form of intelligence, the closest we might ever get to encountering alien sentience. Octopi show attitudes toward people and things, curiosity about objects, and base level comprehension of the dynamism of their surroundings, all in ways that Godfrey-Smith goes out of his way to explain cannot be explained, as in so many other animals, as mere functions of necessity or reactions. Octopi have some sort of comprehension of the world; they have a distinguishable stratum of activity and quirks that unquestionably elevates them above mere automata. And of course they're physically weird and distinct in all of the ways that the inhabitants of the briny deep tend to be.Although this book could tend toward tedium, left some big questions unanswered, and anthropomorphized a bit too liberally, it was really interesting and weird (in a good way!) overall!"
49,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"OTHER MINDSThe Octopus and Evolution of Intelligent LifeBy Peter Godfrey-Smith (first published in 2017)When we imagine the lives and experiences of simpler animals, we often visualize some scaled down version of ourselves.Cephalopods bring us into contact with something very different.An octopus’s eye is similar to ours. It is formed like a camera, with an adjustable lens that focuses an image on a retina.The eyes are similar, but the brains behind them are different on almost every scale.If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all.To understand the evolution of human beings and the cephalopods we have to go back in time on the tree of evolution, about 600 million years.The last common ancestor of ourselves and the octopus, or of mammals and cephalopods,was likely a tiny creature, just millimetres long, like a small flattened worm, swimming about or crawling on the seafloor, or both? Maybe with simple eyes, with little else defining head and tails. With time passing for unknown reasons some of these worms developed differently and the tree of evolution started to make branches. One path from that underwater split leads to our branch of the tree, the vertebrates, etc. to mammals and eventually to humans.The other branch leads to the invertebrate species, like crabs, bees, worms, and also the molluscs, including clams, oysters, and snails.Most of the animals on this branch are relatively small, with exceptions. Some developed very complex social behaviours, but they all have small nervous systems.Except for the cephalopods. These are a subgroup within the molluscs, they are related to clams, and snails, but they have developed large nervous systems and an ability to behave in ways very different from other invertebrates.They did this in a very different evolutionary path from ours.Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the world of invertebrate animals.Cephalopods are an independent experiment of nature in the evolution of large brains and complex behaviour. On a different branch of the evolutionary tree, nature built minds twice over.Some of the cephalopods became smart.A common octopus has about 500 million neurons in its body. Roughly the same range as various smaller animals, close to the range of dogs, and cephalopods have a much larger nervous system than all other invertebrates.When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets are off. There is no part by part correspondence between our brains and theirs.Indeed, octopuses have not collected the majority of their neurons in their heads, most of their neurons are found in their arms.Half a billion neurons – why so many? What do they do for the animal? Nobody knows. We can make some guesses, that’s all.There is a mental surplus in the octopus.There are some similarities with the human being, as its eyes, but also some psychological Like learning, rewards, and punishment, long-term a short-term memory, they also seem to have something like sleep, possibly even something like dreams.Some features are a mixture of similarity and difference. We have hearts; the octopus has three hearts. Their heart pumps blood that is blue-green, using copper as the oxygen-carrying molecule instead of the iron which makes our blood red.There is the sizeable nervous system but built on a different design, with different relationships between the body and the brain.The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide, in a sense it is disembodied.Photoreceptors have been found to be active in the skin of a particular octopus. It appears that octopuses can see with their skin. More studies are needed for confirmation.Some cuttlefish and a few octopuses display a continual kaleidoscopic process of colour change that seems to be disconnected from anything going on outside them. They appear instead to be an inadvertent expression of the electrochemical tumult inside them.This is probably the closest we will come to meet an intelligent alien.The author of this study, Professor Peter Godfrey-Smith, is teaching philosophy and science at the University of New York and the University of Sidney.He is also a skilled scuba diver.In his many diving excursions mostly off the East coast of Australia, over several years, he made the most delightful and exciting encounters with octopuses and cuttlefish.""I have sometimes been able to recognize an individual over many days, occasionally over a week. It's not easy to re-identify animals which can change their entire colour and shape at will, but sometimes a distinctive scar makes it possible.Different animals respond differently to me. Some tend to come forward, in a resting pattern of colours and observe. The friendliest of them have reached an arm forward to touch me.Sometimes I reach an arm out close to his arms, but do not touch them. The cuttlefish reaches the tip of an arm out to touch mine. Then he shifts back to a few feet distance.""One possible interpretation of this action might be that the cuttlefish see if I might be good to eat.Another day, diving with my friend Matt in the Octopus site, we came across an octopus who seized Matt’s hand and led him over the seafloor, pulling him along behind. We have no Idea why he might have done this.The story tells us of many more exciting behaviours of these creatures, both in captivity in laboratories as well as in nature at the bottom of the ocean.The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible. All the early stages, the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.Professor Godfrey-Smith published this study in 2017, and it is likely a most up to date treaties on this subject.I read this book with enormous pleasure, as a precious follow up on my previous readings onDarwin, Pliny, Lamarck and Buffon, the History of Nature.I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this field of science."
50,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"The author is a philosopher of Science. This is a discussion of the evolutionary origin of consciousness with much, albeit referenced, speculation, and centered largely on the seeming intelligence of Cephalopods (primarily the Octopus and Cuttlefish). The text is rambling and includes digressions on, for example, Baboon behavior and an excellent summary of the evolutionary theory of aging. Although it is not quite a fully organized classical essay, I enjoyed all of it, especially the information on the natural history of the Cephalopods. A few remarks, e.g. 'the esophagus of the Octopus passes through its brain', will probably lead me to more reading on the anatomy of these animals. Oh, and that may be it for me and Calamari."
51,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This was probably between 3 and 4 stars for me, but I'm rounding up because I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would. This was a 'book challenge' book needed to check off a box. I mention that only because this is a book I would have never, ever picked up on my own. But I enjoyed this psychological approach to octopuses. The cephlopods mentioned were intriguing. I learned so many facts about them, and some of these facts were contrary to what I have always believed. I also rounded up because I loved the narrator's voice of the audio edition. This was nicely done."
52,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31494372-m-m-m-s,4,"The material here hangs together better as a series of essays than as chapters of a book. Some parts describe evolutionary history and movement along the tree of life, some describe cephalopod biology and the author's experiences with cephalopods, and others apply evolutionary biology to explain -- or at least outline an explanation of -- consciousness. Powerful stuff by one possessed of a contageous curiosity."
53,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8923164-claudia,3,"This book reminded me of why I enjoy non-fiction reading, especially the kind full of anecdotes. Interesting enough, somewhere between having an intellectual crush on Jacques-Yves Cousteau, suffering through undergraduate Historical Geology, and watching Finding Dory, I must have learned a thing or two about cephalopods that came rushing back to my consciousness.

54,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"Mixed bag. The science is interesting, the photos are cool, the philosophy ... Well, that part got long- winded. I did finish it, with some skimming. Definitely worth a look, and at least a skim, if your library has a copy. And, as Carol points out, Octopus City!: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And I see her review links through to another level. I love this kind of stuff."
55,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,The title of the book over-hypes it. It doesn't really address the issues that it claims to investigate. But it has some interesting anecdotes about octopuses.

The book deals with the science and philosophy of consciousness. The science part is fine, but to be honest, I couldn't quite grasp the philosophy part. All in all, it was a good one time read."

58,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/992639-melanie,1,"I really, really, really wanted to like this book! I am a huge fan of cephalopods and have read many lay-science books about them. Aside from which I have a BS in biochemistry, which means I've taken a lot of biology courses. I'm putting that out there because it colors my critique of this book and I want to be honest about that.When I bought the book, I failed to notice that the author is a doctor of philosophy. Actual philosophy, not like a Ph.D. in some random, hopefully scientific field. The author is actually a philosopher. And he is approaching a scientific question with a philosophical approach. That might be okay in the question of how intelligent or how conscious or what drives cephalopod behavior, but the author dives well out of his area of informed discourse, arriving at some truly absurd speculations or even conclusions.For instance, how did multicellular life arise? Lacking any background information on this and possibly failing to understand whatever he read, he concluded that multiple single cell organisms joined forces to create a new multicellular entity. While it is true that most cells these days do contain organelles that are derived from what were once probably infectious or parasitic species, this is quite different from entirely different types of organisms simply sticking together. Such a scenario would mean that humans, among others, would be composed of two distinct cell lines in a single body. How this could work reproductively is a serious question.Another weird area of ignorance is his marvel that octopuses can navigate a complex environment and yet know exactly where they are and how to get back to it each night. This is not some marvel behaviour of octopuses, it is a common, almost universal, fact of life for motile species. Insects can do it. Fish can do it. Crabs can do it. Butterflies can travel half-way around the world. Dragonflies know where all of their feeding grounds are. While I admit that this is an impressive skill which I don't think is fully understood, the author presents it as a distinct issue related to octopuses.Also, his own anecdotal experiences do not count as a valid basis for scientific conjuncture. This is not the scientific method. Personal experiences are influenced by personal experiences. An example of this that many people may have experienced is that after buying a new car, you start seeing that type of car everywhere. Did people suddenly follow your inclination to buy that model of car? No, you became sensitized to their presence. This is why scientists do not rely on anecdotal evidence.In the question of consciousness, where the author has a legitimate claim to expertise, he is rambling and long-winded. Alas, I was unable to finish the book."
59,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38449140-alasdair-reads,3,"A fascinating topic area. There are two principle difficulties with the book. First, there is a lot of speculative, broad brush science here. The author, to his credit does a good job of alerting us and not making unsupported assertions this but it can be difficult to wade through, particularly in the rather dry area of evolutionary history that makes up the first part of the book. Second, the author never quite brings alive the story of the people and events involved in the same way as he does his love and the strangeness of these animals. It is the rare book that would work better as a documentary series."
