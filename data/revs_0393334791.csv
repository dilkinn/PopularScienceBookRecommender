0,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"(Joint review with JORDAN, who's actually finished the book)- George?- Mmm?- Don't go to sleep.- Mmm.- You are going to sleep!- Mm-mm.- George, tell me something you did today.- Um... I read a book.- That's better! Move around a bit. Yes, that's right, put your hand there. Good. What book?- Bonk. By Mary Roach.- That silly book about sex?- It's not silly! She's really got a lot of interesting things to say!- Like?- Ah... I liked the bit about women's orgasms.- Guess you don't know much about that. OW!- Sorry, you asked for it. Now do you want me to tell you what she said about women's orgasms?- OK. I'm sorry I teased you. Put your hand back there. What did she say?- Well, she spends a lot of time discussing whether women really do have vaginal orgasms. I didn't understand how many different opinions there were. It's complicated!- Complicated?- Alright, so most women have clitoral orgasms. Stroking or kissing their clit gets them off. - Certainly works for me. Talking of which...- No, wait, let me finish. The question is whether so-called vaginal orgasms are really just clitoral orgasms in disguise. The guy's penetrating her, and it gives her an orgasm, but what's really happening is that he's just indirectly stimulating her clit. So it's not really a vaginal orgasm at all.- Well, I agree with her. I think that's what's happening. But how could you know for sure?- Look, that's what's so interesting. There was this French princess. Marie Bonaparte. Her clit was a long way from her vagina, and she never got any vaginal orgasms.- Did her guy have to go down on her then?- Um... I think this was before oral sex was invented. She talked to a bunch of women, and measured how far their clits were from their vaginas, and asked them how sex was for them. She has some French word that means you're a woman whose clit is a long way from her vagina. And...- There's a French word that means that??- There is! Look it up. I told you there was good stuff in this book! Teleclit... something. Téléclitoridienne. Aren't you impressed that I remembered that?- You're not pronouncing it right.- Well, how am I supposed to say it?- Téléclitoridienne.- That's what I said. I think. Anyway, the princess found that most téléclitoridienne women didn't enjoy penetrative sex. She wrote a scientific paper about it.- You're asking me to believe that a princess went around, like a hundred years ago, asking a bunch of women questions about their sex lives and measuring how far their clits were from their pussies, and then published the results in a medical journal?- I agree, it does sound a bit weird. But that's the way Mary Roach tells the story. The princess was so convinced by her findings that she paid a surgeon to operate on her and move her clit further in, so she could have better sex.- And did it work?- Well, no. She never had an orgasm again. He screwed up. But he figured out what he did wrong, and next time it worked.- What a sad story! George?- Mmm?- Do you think I'm téléclitoridienne? - Ah... well...- Could you look?- OK. Turn that light on. Hm. I think you're mesoclitoridienne. Between one and three centimeters. I'm guessing one and a half.- Oh, what a relief. But I think you should check more carefully.- Like this?- Well, I was thinking more like this.- Can you really measure distances that way?- George, don't be silly. Of course you can.- Mmm.- George?- Mmm?- I'm glad I'm not a French princess. "
1,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I’ve never had internet sex – there must be another word for it, cybersex, obviously, but I’m thinking more along the lines of keyboard sex. All the same, a couple of years ago (and purely as a community service, you understand) I started working on a series of words that could be typed using only the left hand. It was another of those projects that I started and fairly quickly lost interest in. If this book is about anything I think it would be fair to say that it is about the absurdity of sex. This is the second of Roach’s books I’ve read lately and I must say sex is much funnier than death. This book was laugh out loud funny.I have also discovered that I have a special face that I wear whenever the words URETHRA and EXPANDED or INSERTED are used in the same sentence. This is especially the case when the word TOOTHBRUSH is also contained in that sentence – but it is not reserved for the collocation of those particular words. In fact, by the end of the book whenever the word URETHRA was used at all I could feel my face responding in a particularly pronounced Pavlovian fashion. There were so many interesting bits to this book that it is pointless me starting or I simply won’t be able to stop. And it was funny and fun – so I am going to recommend it and recommend it highly.The bit I found most interesting was right at the end, where she was talking about tests that were done in the 1970s that found that the people who enjoyed sex the most were homosexual couples – either gay or lesbian. This was because the heterosexual couples tended to see sex as a destination they needed to reach as quickly as they could, while the homosexual couples played more and teased and delighted in each other more. For some reason we seem to have become sold on the ‘sex as performance’ metaphor. At one point she said that many women felt sexually inadequate because they believed themselves to be unattractive and spent the whole time worrying about what they looked like – watching themselves in effect. Sex is about being there with someone else, and is better the more ‘there’ you are – it is a dance, rather than a race or a beauty contest.Now, this is the second time recently that I’ve discovered just how incurious I am and have always been. The first time was with Mr Fry’s autobiography when he was talking about boys sticking their fingers up their bums. That simply never occurred to me when I was growing up. And to be honest, you could leave me alone in a room for a thousand years and I would never think of having sex with a vacuum cleaner. I am assuming that is not what Billy Bragg means when he has a female character in one of his songs say, “no amount of poetry will mend this broken heart, but you can push the Hoover ‘round if you want to make a start”.So, what did I learn? Well, besides that gays make the best lovers, that it is best not to rush into a room when you hear a man calling out “Titan, Titan, Titan” on a video your wife is watching and if God has a place it certainly isn’t in the bedroom, I think that the best of this book – like Stiff – is acknowledging that life, death and sex are all a bit absurd and for that we really should be very grateful.

2,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036930-michael,3,"This book review has received a strong 'R' rating for disturbing sexual content. If you are eating, you might not wanna read this review right now. DON'T go into this book thinking it'll get you in the mood. In fact, it may disturb the mood right out of you.Did you know? Before Viagra, guys who couldn't maintain a good stiffy would often have ""stilts"" of some sort inserted inside of their penis skin, and they would essentially wander through life with a half-boner that never went away so they could still bonk. Special pants were designed to make this perpetual-half-mast issue less obvious.Also, apparently a lot of guys are turned on by putting stuff inside the skin of their penises. To me, this sounds like exactly the LAST thing I would EVER want to do. For those of you without a penis, let me remind you, tis quite sensitive. Picture putting a bicycle in your mouth. I expect that would be about as painful as putting a gerbil up your. . . I did mention gerbils are popular for this, right? ALSO, congratulations to homosexuals. In several studies, it has been suggested that homosexuals tend to be much less inhibited during sex. They tend to take their time about it much more, to spend more time with foreplay, and to communicate more actively with their mates during bonk. Apparently, heteros have a tendency to just git 'er done, then go back to watching TV. Because humans tend to be prudish, for many a year, all studies of sexuality were done by watching other animals doing the bonk. Unfortunately, this is a very ineffective way of studying HUMAN sexuality, since pigs and monkeys tend to orgasm in a matter of seconds and not derive a lot of enjoyment out of it. Also, do you know about electrical dick machines? Well, now you do! You can buy a kit to build your own machine that serves the purpose of making a plastic cock gyrate. Check out the latest issue of Boy's Life, they always encourage the buying and building of random shit--I can't tell you how many times I tried to convince my parents to let me buy a kit to build a hovercraft, but they always asked, ""What are you going to do with a hovercraft?"" And I would inevitably respond with, ""I don't KNOW, but hovercrafts are awesome!""Similarly, electric dick machines are awesome. AND, perhaps this is the most important and encouraging fact of all. SHORTER WOMEN (in general) ORGASM BETTER AND MORE OFTEN. There is science to back this up, and I don't remember the details, but I do remember the rule of thumb: the distance between belly button and vagina is a good indication of the clitoris's location. The shorter this distance, the more conveniently placed the clitoris, and the more action it will receive during bonk. This was quite entertaining, and I learned a lot--some of which I didn't want to know. That said, I didn't find this one as entertaining as Stiff. Bonk is similar in a lot of ways, taking the same humorous approach to the topic, and focusing on the bizarre and fascinating. If you feel like reading something that's light, fun, and able to make your genitals suck up into your body with fear, give this book a go. "
3,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"3.5 stars.This was like cup of cocoa sex. Sex is always good but sometimes you can't help hoping it will be over soon and you can have a cup of cocoa, maybe with cream. Marshmallows even. Maybe a sprinkle of cinnamom and some grated chocolate curls. Oh there I go, mind drifted off.Read 13 Dec. 2013 and forgotten about until now. Now what was it reminded me. Friday night. Hopeful. And if not... there is always cocoa."
4,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51848-geoffrey-kleinman,2,"I really wanted to like Bonk. Mary Roach seems joyous in her celebration of the science of sex. It's clear she's spent (and thoroughly enjoyed) her time researching the subject, unfortunately the book never really comes together. Mary Roach's 'signature wit' comes of more as juvenile as she seems lost in her perspective on her subject. Is Bonk a personal essay about her journey through the world of sex research? A portrait of the history of sex and the science surrounding it? Roach never settles in with a clear perspective on her subject and ends up getting lost in the telling.I'm not a huge fan of footnotes, I respect when they are used well but despise when they are used as long tangents for a broken narrative. In Bonk Roach uses long footnotes on almost every other page and uses them to add 'witty commentary' to some of her points. Most of the footnotes should have been integrated into the main text as they often feel orphaned from it.The most telling chapter of this book is when Roach goes to Cairo to get insight into sex research in Egypt. Her trip, the results and the chapter are a complete let down and yet Roach tries to salvage it at the end with a chest thumping cry of how important people dedicating their lives to sexual discourse are. It's at this point you can see that Roach is 'rounding third' in her book and realizes she doesn't have the goods to bring it all home. It's a real shame. This book could and should have been better. Mary Roach is a fine writer, an obvious research nut and the subject is one that is anything but unengaging. Unfortunately it's yet another book where the editor let the author run free. Some real hard nosed editing, some real focus, a re-arrangement of the footnotes and a clarity of perspective and you've got a fine book. But what's in this pages isn't worth picking this book up in hardcover. It's really a casual mass-market paperback read (or even a used one at that)."
5,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3,"Mary Roach is always on her game. She is funny, and her subjects are all so interesting. The narrator of this audiobook was also on point. But while I enjoyed this book, I think my 3 star rating is mostly my own fault.Because I apparently already knew all the freaky weird details about sex... like almost all of them covered in this book. In this case, I guess my love of sexual oddities and all things weird conspired against me because parts of this book felt, dare I say it, boring. I still love you, Mary Roach, and I'll be listening to Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers very soon. "
6,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/670054-jess,4,"i audiobook'd this, the third feature-length scientific expedition of mary roach. i love! love! love! mary roach. i have bought multiple copies of her first book, stiff, and have managed to permanently ""lend"" every one of them out. audiobooking the curious couplings of science and sex, however, was a very strange experience. picture this: i am walking around downtown pittsburgh, just like every morning, and there are strangers passing me left and right with serious or sleepy looks, briefcases and plastic bags, and i am listening to a chapter on Lady Boners. i'm stuck in traffic, the way i most despise spending my time, and learning about the erotic rituals of artificial insemination of pigs in norway. very! strange! if you're looking for a forthright and humorous scientific break-down of erotic encounters, the clit, the g-spot, the erection.... well, this may not be the book for you. roach focuses her special, special attentions on the sex researchers that have changed the landscapes of our bodies and our bedrooms. quick, tell me, which sexologist used his research as an outlet for his attraction to men? whatever happened to the dildo cams constructed decades ago for sex research of vaginal arousal? what do you know about the discovery of the g-spot? have you ever read a graphic description of the surgeries performed to provide erections for men with erectile dysfunction? what do you know about the distance between the clitoris and the vaginal opening, and the orgasmic capacity therein? interested to find out which sex researchers had to perform their studies under the cover of nightfall? read BONK. roach explores the ways that funding moves (or not) through research facilities, the stigma and social implications of being involved in sex research, and the feelings of grown-up children of researchers. we visit the institutions that are supportive and not. roach pieces together the changing times and cultural notions of sex, and how our perception of sex restricts or facilitates collection of data and ability to publish. she produces a clear picture of the historical variance in our cultural acceptance of sex research. basically, the book is a lot of the grimy politicking that happens when people are jostling for funds and the neighbors might not approve of your research. it's an entertaining ride through the scientific research industry. along the way, i learned that sex researchers are both flawed and fascinating, and have both the purest and most dubious intentions and methods. and some of them actually seem likable (cindy mestin, for example!) of course, we learn the most from the exceptional cases, and roach brings enough material from the margins to make your head (or sphincter) spin. i appreciated her examinations of the roles that prostitutes played, especially in the early days of sex research. i loved the tales of wild sexual encounters in a rented attic for the sake of science. i loved that mary roach talked her husband into having sex with her in a lab for the sake of science. i am not sure that i could talk my spouse into that, even for the sake of science. i was enthralled by the last chapter's mention of the scientific proof of better sex between gay couples than straight couples. i'm biased, i guess, but i agree."
7,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2499261-rachel,3,"One of my favorite parts in Fifty Shades of Grey -- by which I mean, one of the parts that gave me the greatest WTF glee -- is the part where Ana, still a virgin, is watching Christian Grey become aroused and is wondering how it's going to fit, and he says to her, ""Don't worry. You expand too.""My first reaction: Sexay! My second reaction: sadness for the fact that for whatever reason, there are other girls and women who also lack the knowledge of basic sexual biology because, as I lamented in my review of Fifty Shades, the subject is so laced with shame.This book is a little more than basic. It's Intermediate Sex Ed, for people who know the names of parts and how they work (and certainly that they fit), but doesn't know the exact mechanics of that working, perhaps. Mary Roach teaches us these things in great detail. For example, what layperson knows that vaginal fluid is plasma secreted through the vaginal walls, its source being the blood that rushes to fill the walls during arousal? (I mean, maybe you reasoned that out, but nowhere in high school sex ed do they say ""here is what makes up vaginal fluid,"" you know?)Who knew that people could think themselves to orgasm, that orgasms can temporarily relieve the spasms and pains of neurological disorder? That quadriplegic and paraplegic persons who are capable of having orgasms -- 40-50% of them -- may feel it not just in their heads and genitals, as those who are not quadriplegic or paraplegic do, but potentially in their chests, arms, shoulders too? Who knew that women experience involuntary symptoms of arousal while watching any sort of sex (homosexual, heterosexual, even sex between animals) but men generally are only aroused by the type(s) of sex they're oriented towards? So much for that oh-so-feminine insult of frigidity.There's also a delightful human element to the book. The fact that the woman who volunteered to publicly demonstrate a sex machine at a convention is in her sixties and wearing bookish glasses. Roach and her husband in hospital gowns, doing it whilst having their genital responses imaged, for science. The accusation of one of Kinsey's biographers that there was a perverse gleam in his eyes as he hovered his face inches away from a copulating couple (also FOR SCIENCE). I guess my complaint would be that there's not enough of that human connection to the genitalia detailed in the book. Not enough of the human connection and communication that -- as Roach concludes in the final chapter, to the surprise of no one -- enhances our sexual experiences. I mean, it's kind of good to get to a point where you've read the word ""clitoris"" so many times it seems as dirty as reading a symbolic logic textbook. But that effect also makes the book about as exciting as symbolic logic at points, so. "
8,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I didn't think she could write a better book than Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, but I was wrong. ""Bonk"" is fantastic. I read it because I love Roach's style, especially on tough subjects. I'm over 50, grew up on a farm, had an active sexual life before & after I got married almost 30 years ago & have raised 3 kids to adulthood. I'm a sysadmin & there isn't much I haven't seen on the Internet. So, how much new material could there be? Plenty, but that wasn't what shocked me. There was very little 'shocking' material. Roach kept the book very much in the realm of science with just enough humor to make it flow & keep it interesting. No, what shocked me was our lack of knowledge in this area.Sex is one of the most important parts of our lives. I would have thought some one or some study would have all the answers. We've split the atom, but we don't really understand an orgasm. What's up with that? Well, sex is a taboo subject. Even after the 60's? Yup. I thought we'd come a long way since the Victorian & 50's era repression, but apparently not. President Clinton (the man with the wandering cigar) actually fired his surgeon general for suggesting that teaching masturbation might help with the AIDs epidemic. Government money & review committees make sex studies a very tough sell. It's also very difficult to find people willing to be studied & even harder to take many measurements. Roach really went all out to write this book. She literally traveled the world (from Danish pig farms to a private Egyptian clinic, all over the U.S. & to the far east) & even participated in some studies. She even talked her husband into helping. (""Dear, how would you like a free trip to London. There's only one little catch..."") And then she wrote a fantastically in-depth book about it with just the right touch of humor.I highly recommend it to everyone. I don't think there is a person on the planet that couldn't learn a lot from this book, even if it is just some of the difficulties the scientific method faces when it runs into our prejudices."
9,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,4," My first book was about human cadavers, and as a result, people assumed that I’m obsessed with death. Now that I have written a book about both sex and death, God only knows what the word on the street is. I have both books by Mary Roach, but I decided to start with the second. I don’t know what that says about me, but I would rather learn more about sex than about cadavers. For now. It’s not surprising that the study of sexual physiology, with a few notable exceptions, did not get rolling in earnest until the 1970s. William Masters and Virginia Johnson said of their field in the late 1950s, “... science and scientist continue to be governed by fear – fear of public opinion, ... fear of religious intolerance, fear of political pressure, and, above all, fear of bigotry and prejudice – as much within as without the professional world.” (And then they said, “Oh, what the hell,” and built a penis-camera.) Mary Roach is an excellent researcher of available scientific articles, followed by interviews and even direct experimentation. But I think the main reason of her success is her very healthy and very sharp sense of humour. Laughter and an awareness of the ridiculous are probably the best tools to fight ignorance, bigotry and prejudice. Natural curiosity will take you that extra step further towards understanding and mastering the subject of today’s lesson.Of course, it helps to have a guide who can sift through the tedious and the unnecessary lengthy dry study raw data in order to pick up the most scandalously funny bits of trivia available. For example, one chapter is called: The Upsuck Chronicles: Does Orgasm Boost Fertility, and What Do Pigs Know About It? I was waiting after that title for a caveat, and sure enough it comes a few pages after describing in detail how workers at a fertility farm for sows increase productivity by fondling their charges: While it is often true that people are pigs, it is never the case that pigs are people. And here is the second reason I rate the book so highly: Mary Roach may be skillful at finding the funny angle of research, but she is also serious about the project, and a truly gifted educator who does more than simply making money out of popular science. I know mostly my own corner of the woods, but I can confirm that sex-ed is still a thorny subject for teenagers and mature readers alike. Church and politicians still treat the subject as tabu, and the easy access of porn on the internet has its own drawbacks in establishing fake theories. We really need a guide to separate for us the true scientists from the quacks and snake oil sellers that prey on the easily gullible. Every Sunday, a dozen or more somber men arrived at Milford train station from points distant, to be processed for Brinkley’s miracle four part operation to restore sexual vigor with goat glands.At one point, Brinkley was taking delivery on forty Toggenburgs a week, housed in a corral behind the hospital. He encouraged his patients to personally select their donor, like diners at a Chinese seafood restaurant being ushered to the aquarium. The study of human physiology is helpful for sure, and we should be grateful to the serious people who tested Viagra on pandas or dressed lab rats in polyester pants, so we can now all wear cotton underwear and improve or sperm-count. Even to those Canadian doctors who wrote an article on “Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups.”But at the end of the day, there will be two people in the privacy of their bedroom, and all the science in the world may be insufficient to take them to the highest peaks of satisfaction. Because, as Mary Roach aptly observes, we are not animals, and pleasure has as much to do with the mind as with the body. Throughout ‘Human Sexual Response’, the researchers encourage open and straightforward communication between partners. It comes as no surprise that they moved on to sex therapy (giving, not getting) following the eleven-year physiology project. In conclusion, this was a fun and informative journey that makes me plan to read more from this irreverent researcher. Even about cadavers and stuff. Bit by bit, sex research has unraveled the hows, whys, whynots, and how-betters of arousal and orgasm. The more the researchers and sexperts and the reporters talked about sex, the easier it became for everyone else to. As communication eases and knowledge grows, inhibitions dissolve and confidence takes root. "
10,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"First she did death and now she does sex. Bonk is a perfect successor to the tour-de-force of Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. She is brilliant in her ability to present to the average readers the triumphs and the twisted in the progression of scientific and medical approaches to these subjects. Roach represents a veritable cross between the styles of Malcolm Gladwell and Bill Bryson. I learned a lot, I laughed a lot. The latter helps with the squeamish and embarrassing bits. For example, the boring or disgusting (to some) aspects of the physiology of erection is improved nicely with her gifted leavening with levity: So now we had achieved , in the parlance of ED experts, an erection. It is a respectable achievement, but it is not enough. An erection, like a motorcycle or lawn, must be maintained. The blood that has filled the two erection chambers must be trapped there, otherwise the erection wilts.Her focus is as much on the human aspects of discovery as in the knowledge itself in the slow progress of discovery about sexuality and its disorders. You keep rooting for some light at the end of the tunnel (so to speak). The concept that masturbation could be healthy seemed to take forever, especially for women. Even as late as the Clinton administration, his Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, was fired for suggesting it should be promoted. From the ancient Greeks, there developed the idea that women produced their own form of semen, and by the middle ages, there was the recognition that, “Young widows, with no sexual outlet and a consequent log jam of womanly seed, were especially prone to hysteria—or ‘womb fury.’ The notion persisted for centuries.” The method of clinical massage was developed by doctors was outlined in a 6th century medical treatise: Aetios of Amida …outlines tactics for release of the she-semen. …Presumably Aetios was mistaking vaginal lubrication for semen. Gynecology was but a sideline interest for Aetios (best known for his eye, ear, and nose texts) and it shows. Women who came to him for contraceptive advice were told to wear a piece of cat liver in an ivory tube attached to the left foot. Though I suppose this might well keep you from getting pregnant, in the same way that wearing Birkenstocks might.When we get to modern times, it turns out that vibrators were initially sold to doctors, who could shorten this chore of “pelvic massage”.. From a book by Maines “The Technology of Orgasm”, Roach shares that most of these doctors were unaware that “the climax of the treatment they were providing was an orgasm.” The home models were advertised with vague claim such as “makes you fairly tingle with the joy of living.” A pair of Star Vibrators were advertised in 1922 as “Such Delightful Companion! Perfect for weekend trips,” as though they could serve up witty repartee and spell you at the wheel.”Throughout the book, Roach’s provides a fascinating and sympathetic tour of the science of sexology, from delvings in the library to a diverse set of road trips ranging from laboratories and surgical clinics to sex toy factories and animal breeding farms. Sometimes she puts herself on the line (and sometimes her poor husband) as a subject in some experiments. She sits in on penile surgeries for erectile dysfunction in Taiwan and empathetically delves into current explorations of treatments for people with spinal cord injury. I like her conclusion:Study by study, the gains may seem small and occasionally silly, but the aggregation of all that has been learned, the lurching tango of academe and popular culture, has led up to a happier place. Hats off and pants off to you all.Her delightful chapter titles give the prospective reader an idea of the ride they will be taking when they pursue this wonderful book:The Sausage, the Porcupine, and the Agreeable Mrs. G: Highlights from the Pioneers of Human Sexual ResponseDating the Penis Camera: Can a Woman Find Happiness with a Machine?The Princess and Her Pea: The Woman Who Moved Her Clitoris, and Other Ruminations on Intercourse OrgasmsThe Upsuck Chronicles: Does Orgasm Boost Fertility, and What Do Pigs Know About It?What’s Going On in There: The Diverting World of Coital ImagingThe Taiwanese Fix and the Penile Pricking Ring: Creative Approaches for ImpotenceThe Testicle Pushers: If Two Are Good, Would Three Be Better?Re-Member Me: Transplants, Implants, and Other Penises of Last ResortThe Lady’s Boner: Is the Clitoris a Tiny Penis?The Prescription Strength Vibrator: Masturbating for HealthThe Immaculate Orgasm: Who Needs Genitals?Mind over Vagina: Women Are ComplicatedWhat Would Allah Say: The Strange, Brave Career of Ahmed ShaftikMonkey Do: The Secret Sway of Hormones“Persons Studies in Pairs”: The Lab That Uncovered Great Sex"
11,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is definitely an entertaining book. Mary Roach did a lot of personal investigations; she visited sex researchers to find out what they are up to, how they do research, what are their findings. She describes the early researchers, like Kinsey and Masters and Johnson. She even volunteers herself and her husband as subjects for some of their experiments. She visits scientists who put willing couples into an MRI to take images of the proceedings. She visits sex toy factories to find out how employees feel about their work.Roach seems also to focus on the bizarre. For example, what people used to do before the days of Viagra. I won't go into the details, in case you are enjoying a snack right now. In fact, many parts of the book are gross enough to avoid reading on a full stomach.Mary Roach not only focuses on the personalities, but on the science as well. As some other reviewers have noted, it is surprising how little is known about human sexuality. One reason is that it can be difficult to get funding in some topics. Also, perhaps little is known because it is a combination of physiology and psychology, mixed together and it is difficult to sort out these two areas.I didn't read this book. I listened to the audiobook version, narrated by Sandra Burr. Her reading is FANTASTIC. Her voice tells much more than just the words printed on the page. If you haven't read the book yet, and want to, I highly recommend listening to the audiobook!"
12,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,4,"Mary Roach takes her practially-patented whirlwind tour through the world of sex research. And for the most part, it's very fun. And occasionally cringe-inducing. But less so than Stiff, which had me avoiding that book any time I was eating. Bonk never gave me the same problems.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

13,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026591-christian-mckay,5,"A book about sex. You might not want to read on.My uncle and I have read all of Mary Roach's books together. We had stomach churning conversations about cadavers at dinner parties and discussed the after life at meant-to-be light-hearted gatherings. He approached me with red in his cheeks after he finished this. ""It's raw. But good."" And that was the end of our conversation.This was the kind of book that kept me laughing so hard people around me had to ask, ""What, what?"" and then I would reiterate some astounding and hilariously written fact about the clitoris or how to appropriately stimulate a pig to prepare her for insemination without stuttering or batting an eyelash.I thought I knew a lot about sex. Turns out there's an untapped (heh) well of information about the infamous researchers and their discoveries. Not only has Roach equipped me with fascinating tidbits to share in random conversations, but I actually think it's going to make my sex life better. Scratch that, it already has. There's plenty I want to talk about/quote, but I'm feeling shy. This is the price you pay for having your mom as a goodreads friend."
14,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50387-coco-prato,1,"In a few words, this book is poorly written and less than informative. The information, IF YOU CAN FIND ANY, in this book is mostly trivial and/or useless. (The actual amount of info in the book might have made a long magazine article in Cosmo.) The book is shamelessly padded with jokes and cutesy side remarks, found both in the text and in anecdotes in textual footnotes. Since they often have nothing to do either with the book's subject or the material on the page at hand, they quickly become first disruptive and then irritating. After about 30 pages, even the sex jokes become lackluster. I like a good sex joke as much as the next person but Ms. Roach is not my best friend nor can I deny the fact that this worthless commentary comes at an expensive price. "
15,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6303796-rachel-bavr,4,"Shocking news: It's really difficult to get funding for sex research even in these enlightened times. I know. A real travesty, right? What strikes me is that there's still a lot we don't know about sex. The female orgasm is harder to figure out than quantum physics because the experience is so subjective, and the various remedies for erectile dysfunction are varied and disputed. In Bonk, Mary Roach, with her customary wit and fearless approach to asking TMI questions, details the relationship between science and sex. I learned a lot. Frankly, I'm a bit ashamed by how much I didn't know about sex. Growing up in Pennsyltucky is hard, you guys. So, in case you were wondering, a lot of sex research consists of people banging in a lab, or in the case of Kinsey's studies, at an undisclosed location. I'm imagining the situation was something like this ...... only without the dreamy CW eye-candy. Masturbation, too. People are still masturbating for science. Researchers check heart rates, blood pressure, watch MRI scans, etc. to uncover the mysteries of how our reproductive systems work.Roach and her husband even throw in their assistance as test subjects, agreeing to have uncomfortable, sanitary sex in an MRI machine while a kindly doctor watches. I can only imagine how my husband would react if I asked him to have sex with me in an MRI machine for science. Roach's husband agreed to it for the trip abroad. Mine ... probably definitely wouldn't be so easily convinced. Bonk is a fun read with a wealth of information explained in every day terms by Roach. I felt a little bogged down by the erectile dysfunction chapters. Is it sexist that erectile dysfunction doesn't really interest me? Even in general, I hear or read the word Viagra, and I'm like ...So, yeah, if that makes me close-minded, sorry to the penises. It is not your fault. The erectile dysfunction stuff wasn't all bad, though. One of my favorite parts of the book is the chapter where Roach goes over all the ways old-timers tried to keep men from masturbating. Masturbation was believed to cause impotence because they apparently thought a penis would eventually die of overuse like a baseball glove or an old pair of shoes. Back in Victorian times, they were patenting devices left and right to stop those dastardly wet dreams. The most horrifying device was strapped on to the penis at bed time. If the man (or boy) became aroused in his sleep, his skin would come into contact with tiny spikes! D: Before impotence was linked with masturbation, a lot of people just thought witches did it, so I suppose the penis torture devices were sort of an improvement, scientifically speaking. Aside from all the kinky stuff, the real stars of the book are the numerous sex researchers that Roach interviews. They're a brave lot, boldly going where other researchers are afraid. For that, I thank them. "
16,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,4,"This is another great book by Mary Roach. I have to hand it to this lady, she leaves no stone unturned in her mission to shed some light on our favourite topic. Mary travelled great distances to watch foreplay between inseminators and sows, voyeuristically spied on mating monkeys, and even went so far as to offer to put a gent's new penile implant to the squeeze test. Heck, she even recruited her husband to do (it) under observation, becoming a research subject in the process.Her research is exhaustive, and I have to admit I learned a lot in reading this book, not least of which was the existence of a ""Fruit Machine"" designed to be used by certain federal agencies in Canada to expose and root out homosexuals from the ranks of our military and RCMP. Apparently the contraption couldn't be tested as the Department of National Defence claimed to have no homosexuals to test and the mounties were understandably reluctant to volunteer.There is a lot of technical and biological info in this book but don't worry...you won't even realize that you're being educated. Mary's delivery is so humorous that this offering is a breeze to read. My only (slight) criticism is that her last chapter seemed abbreviated and perhaps a bit rushed. I'm going to read everything she puts out."
17,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Mary Roach, as usual, is drawn to the weird and the wonderful. I love her sense of humour about whatever her current obsession happens to be. A book about sex research could be dry and boring, but not with Ms. Roach at the helm. Male readers may cringe at several of the chapters regarding surgery on the family jewels—it made me a little queasy. I am also amazed that she managed to drag her husband along to participate in research projects with her. He is obviously a guy with a sense of adventure!Sex researchers, both animal and human, were good sports to show off their work in progress or discuss published results. As stated a couple of time in the book, publicity can sometimes be a hindrance to obtaining research money, so they were either very established researchers or willing to risk the exposure. We’re all interested in the topic, but few of us have the time or inclination to track down these great stories! Thank you, Mary Roach, for being the obsessive researcher for us."
18,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,3,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Taffy: ""Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex"" by Mary RoachMany eons ago I had a friend at work who was always boasting how many times he did it per week: 'We've experimented with positions, more than 100 altogether' and some-such. There was a sense it had become a bit of a braggadiccio thing. Well, firstly the idea of counting all these positions is risible but of course there aren't over a 100 different sexual positions, merely 4, maybe 5 that give scope for various variations. "
19,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,5,"Not as raunchy as I'd hoped for, but then the subtitle doesn't exactly set you up for raunch. It was my own fault, my own fervid expectation, based on my enjoyment of reading Roach's other books. That said, Roach is never a disappointment. "
20,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8678116-muhammed-hebala,3,"Roach strikes a nice balance between science, history and humor to keep the book interesting and readable.I think that the best of this book – like Stiff – is acknowledging that life, death and sex are all a bit absurd and for that we really should be very grateful. if you're looking for a forthright and humorous scientific break-down of erotic encounters, the clit, the g-spot, the erection.... well, this may not be the book for you.roach focuses her special, special attentions on the sex researchers that have changed the landscapes of our bodies and our bedrooms. quick, tell me, which sexologist used his research as an outlet for his attraction to men? whatever happened to the dildo cams constructed decades ago for sex research of vaginal arousal? what do you know about the discovery of the g-spot? have you ever read a graphic description of the surgeries performed to provide erections for men with erectile dysfunction? what do you know about the distance between the clitoris and the vaginal opening, and the orgasmic capacity therein? interested to find out which sex researchers had to perform their studies under the cover of nightfall? want to read about Coital interlocking, penile vibrators, the Lazarus sign, spectatoring and mindfulness? read BONK. That said, I didn't find this one as entertaining as Stiff. Bonk is similar in a lot of ways, taking the same humorous approach to the topic, and focusing on the bizarre and fascinating. If you feel like reading something that's light, fun, and able to make your genitals suck up into your body with fear, give this book a go.This book could and should have been better. Mary Roach is a fine writer, an obvious research nut and the subject is one that is anything but unengaging. Unfortunately it's yet another book where the editor let the author run free. Some real hard nosed editing, some real focus, a re-arrangement of the footnotes and a clarity of perspective and you've got a fine book."
21,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/715797-lori-whitwam,4,"(Review starts with a recent blog post, written mid-book, then my conclusion)Well, maybe it is, just a little bit.As I've often stated here, I read very little non-fiction. Too dry, too dull, too fact-intensive. Just too. A couple of months ago, I read Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers by Mary Roach. Roach's good-natured obsession with researching anything and everything that interests her is infectious. Plus, I'm fairly morbid, so the topic appealed to me. Seriously, I can watch surgery shows, gruesome real-life crime investigations, you name it. If I thought I could stand medical school (and all those annoying patients I'd have to deal with during my internship and residency), I think I'd love to be a forensic pathologist. I'd donate my body to the Body Farm, where they place corpses all around the wooded property to study how we decay under various conditions, but I suspect that would upset Tom. Also, then my ashes couldn't be mixed with those of my dogs and scattered somewhere scenic.When I discovered that Roach had a new book coming out, I was excited. Then I learned that Fabulous Fiancee had a copy, and that I could borrow it. Jackpot!The new book is Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex. What could possibly be more fascinating than experiments and research involving dead humans? Sex? Maybe? Yeah, I'm thinking so.I'm only about halfway through it, but just had to mention it here. You can check my Goodreads page in a couple of days and read my full review. The link is over in the right sidebar of Fermented Fur.Am I fascinated? Yep. Am I intrigued? Amazed? You betcha. Am I a wee bit disturbed and perhaps even alarmed? Oh, yeah.Early ""sex researchers"" were inventive, barbaric, and creepy, but as curious in their own ways as Roach is today. And some of the things people do? I thought I was pretty well-informed regarding some of the less-conventional, more taboo, things humans do in their quests for excitement. (I read lots of fiction, and just because it's fiction doesn't mean it isn't about things that really do take place.) Now, I realize I have no clue - and am probably better off that way. There are things (which should not be considered ""insertable"") that are placed into regions where they were never intended to be. There are methods of ""study"" that are at least as bad as the worst porn scenario you've ever seen, imagined, or heard about.And who knew there were so many uses for Pyrex?The truly fascinating thing is Roach's absolute dedication to research. She talks to people about things that most of us are taught to never, ever say out loud. She asks questions that would cause the average adult human being to bite off her own tongue before they would actually voice it. And, above all, she is all about ""the best way to research is to participate.""Imagine being Mr. Roach, and your wife tells you she's arranged for the two of you to take a little trip. It all sounds lovely, until you learn that the focal point of your trip will be having sex inside an MRI tube so the researcher can get accurate images of just exactly how men and women ""fit."" The name of that chapter? How 'bout ""What's Going On In There?"" Imagine, lying on your side spooned up to your wife, in an oh-so-intimate (if not even remotely private) moment, with the doctor's hand on your hip as he leans over the two of you to wave a scanning wand in front of your wife's abdomen. Then he tells you he's gotten the images he needs, and it's OK for you to finish now.Sure, some people might really, really like that. Most of us really, really wouldn't.At the moment, I'm learning all the fascinating physiological facts behind erectile dysfunction, having just completed the part about the pig artificial insemination facility in Denmark and the segment about the Center for Sex and Culture's annual fund-raiser called the ""Masturbate-a-Thon."" A glance at the table of contents indicates I shall learn far more than I ever imagined about male and female body parts, the absence thereof, the presence of too many thereof, health, hormones, religion, culture, and ""accessories,""... all with Roach's informative yet humorous narrative to guide me.Fun. Disturbing at times. Really not a mood-setter, though, if you get my drift. But it's non-fiction, and I'm reading it, and any author who can accomplish that definitely knows how to write and educate and entertain. And isn't that why we read?But I might just sleep with the lights on for the next couple of months.(Conclusion)How Roach can cover so much factual material and remain so entertaining is a gift. Wonder what her next topic will be?One interesting fact is that one Masters & Johnson study showed that gay and lesbian couples are better at sex than heterosexual couples. Apparently they are more in tune to what their partner wants/needs, they don't see it as a means to an end and tend to linger over each stage, they're more in tune to each other's ""almost there"" signals and are better able to prolong the event, and they're better about speaking up about what they do and don't want.

22,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1719442-jen,3," Bonk. Bang. Scrump. Everyone has a different word for it. Sometimes there aren't even words; a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, and an eyebrow lift or two can be enough. But what's behind it? The science of it? And hasn't everyone wondered about what happens if a guy loses a ball (or two) and needs another? Where to go? What to do? It's all in this book. That written, this book is not as interesting as Roach's book on cadavers. But before I'm called a prude, I want to make sure that all have the opportunity to call me pompous. Here's the reason why: Apart from clit measuring and data specifics, I had read quite a bit of all of her research before...either I just have managed to read a lot on sex accidentally or on purpose. The book just didn't blow me away (twss) with new facts and information.  But I did have a favorite part, which involved mice. When two mice (male and female, btw) are bonking, scrumping, hokey-pokeying, whatever, placing a piece of cheese beside them doesn't distract the male. But, oh! How the female is divided! So, now my thoughts are out...okay book. Sometimes funny, as expected from Mary Roach. But my younger sister really liked this one. I think it was the idea that people buy cojones implants for dogs that did it- broke through her Jane Austen exterior.  And my middle sister? The one who likes family smut and calls the vagina a ""gine?"" To her, this book was okay. Boring, really. I mean, who wants to read about scientific details regarding dildos and couples getting it on inside an MRI tube? To her, reading about this took away from the act itself. I think she wants sex to be like magic- why analyze it and try to see what is behind the curtain? Just enjoy. Oooh and aaah. Poor thing, she couldn't even finish the book. Her favorite parts described animal sex research (which reminds me, female pigs have clits inside their vaginas. Forget the phrase lucky dog. Lucky sow!). But we did agree to a new rule- Sisters' book club will only focus on fiction from now on. We are too diverse a trio to try non-fiction."
23,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Mary Roach is always entertaining - possibly our best living author just for ""shit that might be fun to talk about at a party"" - but this isn't her best work.The thing that's fun about her is that she gets hands-on with her research. She visits corpse farms and goes into low-earth orbit. And there just wasn't as much of that here. I'm all ""I just want to read about Mary Roach fucking things,"" I know, and why am I complaining? She nails her husband in an MRI tube! - but that's sortof about it, and the rest of it is pretty heavy on descriptions of studies, and that makes it feel like one of those articles someone puts on Facebook called something like ""Does Semen Cure Depression?"" and, like, yeah, obviously you're going to click on that - anyway it's like 300 of those in a row. Which isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's not the best thing either."
24,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18265148-amanda,4,"If ever there were a book about sex that were less sexy than Bonk, it would have to have been written specifically for that purpose. A veritable calliope of penis especially, vaginas, engorged... everythings and extremely graphic, medical detail, this is not for the faint of heart. Yes, you'll need to gird your loins for this one. (Sorry).If you're interested in a scientific look at sex and how it works (or doesn't work, as is often so lamentably the case), then this is probably the book for you. If, however, you're looking for something to make you want to have sexy sex lots of sexy times, then this is probably (assuredly) not the book for you and you should really, really not read it. In fact if you'd like to have sex ever again and not think about castrations, multiple speculae being put where they shouldn't be, or things being (gah) stretched that had no need to be (gah) then you should really stay away from this book. Forever.In fact, you probably shouldn't even put this book near your genitals or near anyone you want to have sex with or in the same room as well, anything. For instance avocados.That's not to say this is a badly written book! In fact it is well-written, and the audiobook is very entertainingly read.Mary Roach has a deft touch that keeps the subject matter refreshing and even appealing, while simultaneously causing unconscious cringing. Honestly, I rather feel that I don't need to know any more about pig, cow or even human sex than this book has taught me. Alright, I probably do, but the subject matter is so disconcerting that I really feel like I don't need to know anything more for a good long while.I didn't think I could get any more grossed out after reading Stiff, but surprise! At times this really, really put me off: I found myself walking around clutching at my genitals at inopportune moments. It's that sort of book. So if you choose to read this book, don't act like I didn't warn you. Read with caution – be aware that there is some disturbing stuff in here! I definitely wouldn't read it to children, pets, pot plants or in the vicinity of dairy you don't want spoiled.If you are curious how your body works and what makes you and your partner tick, or just want to be reassured that that strange quirk or pecadillo is not just normal but healthy, then this is the book for you.But please, my fellow humans, stop putting things up your urethrae. It's just not good."

Take heed: you can learn a lot about the science of sex from smutty books. Roach is a very engaging writer. She does an incredible amount of research for her books and makes science approachable and FUN. One tidbit; if you need a penis reattached, Thailand is the place to go:
Two of the wives flushed the penises down the toilet, forcing their husbands to grope for their lost manhood inside the septic tank. (Incredibly, both were found, cleaned, cleaned some more, and reattached.) More commonly, the women would hurl the penis out the window. In the cases described in “Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in Siam,” all the recovered penises were “grossly contaminated.”Better that than eaten by livestock. Many rural Thai homes are elevated on pilings, with the family’s pigs, chickens, and ducks tending to mill about seeking shade in the space underneath. It is not, oddly, the pigs, but rather the ducks, that the castrated Thai must worry about. The paper does not provide the exact number of penises eaten by ducks, but the author says there have been enough over the years to prompt the coining of a popular saying: “I better get home or the ducks will have something to eat.”

26,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,5,"Hilarious! Science? Sex? Yes, it's as sordid and stomach turning as you might expect from ""science and sex"" (just think ""1800's"" for a second, and if that doesn't do it, think ""foreign objects...""), but Mary Roach makes it hilarious.This is sort of a roving history of scientists turning their keen (and until lately, MALE) eyes toward sexual function. Naturally cultural mores were turning their keen eyes on the scientists (they must be pervs!), so sex science is predictably stunted, and even now seriously challenged. For a long time, they looked at animals having sex instead to make inferences about human sexuality, because that's not pervy at all. Or they felt around under a Victorian skirt. Then science got the fMRI. Enter Mary Roach. Literally.My money's on Mary Roach's next book being either on taxes or religion. Sex - check. Death - check. You see? Both of those are total winners- she's a gangsta science writer."
27,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4303446-megan,3,"Well thank god that's over. (That's what she said.) This book had lots of interesting studies and facts and tidbits about sex and how our body parts work and what turns people on and off, but after a while I just started to get bored with it so it took me forever to finish. There's only so much discussion about vajayjays and penii functions that a girl can take before she feels like she's reading a medical journal. Or some kind of really weird, specific porn. This is definitely way more entertaining than a medical journal, don't get me wrong, Mary Roach kept it light and funny in parts (especially for the first half of the book), but eventually I started to feel a bit bogged down with facts that just seemed sort of useless and uninteresting. Like the penis implant procedure - I don't really need to know the specifics of that surgery since I have no plans to do it anytime soon. So maybe a little less time could've been spent there (I'm sure male readers would have liked a break from crossing their legs and holding onto their business for dear life through that part as well).Things I learned:""The stereotypical ideal female - Barbie tall with Barbie big breasts - is the one least likely to respond to a manly hammering.""""The Science of Orgasm says that people who have regular orgasms seem to have less stress and enjoy lower rates of heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and endometriosis. They also appear to live longer.""""Cheese crumbs spread out in front of a copulating pair of rats may distract the female, but not the male."" [Because everybody knows bitches like their cheese] I definitely enjoyed  Packing for Mars more and thought it was much funnier, but I'll continue to read Roach's other books for future laughs and strange educational experiences."

(OK, I don't really read a lot of funny stuff. Occupational hazard?) Almost every footnote made me LOL and want to mark the page so I could post it on GR somewhere, but there were just too many good ones. But you know what stuck with me most about this book? How revolutionary it is for women to have control of their bodies, sexually, reproductively, to be intellectually informed about them... Though there are less recent Western examples of puritanical and misogynistic ideas influencing and inhibiting sex research and gynocological treatment throughout the book, the chapter about the researcher in Egypt was heartbreaking.The book was also just very informative, and I thought I was pretty informed about sex and my own anatomy! More important, reading it (learning more about my own body, learning more about a natural human activity) helped me further shrug off my own puritanical sexual programming, and anything that contributes to that is a definite winner for me. As is any writer who gives me this moment of Zen:You have no idea what a perplexing mess is female arousal."

Roach visits implant surgeons in taiwan, pig breeders in denmark, 'does it' in an MRI tube in a london hospital, and hangs out with one of the biggest supplier of dildos to the states. PLUS, there's rats forced to wear polyester pants for a year to see if it cuts into how much action they get. it does--- almost as much as wearing birkenstocks, M.R. reports--and with that remark, she forever wins my heart.not as great as 'STIFF' but well worth reading"
30,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"As I recently noted on Twitter, there is an uncomfortable amount of talk about inserting stuff into bodily orifices that shouldn’t be inserted there. This is not a book for the faint of heart.Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex is the third book in the #bangingbookclub, run by Hannah Witton, Leena Norms, and Lucy Moon. Check out the Twitter feed to see what everyone else is saying about Bonk and the other reads (last month’s was 
The Vagina Monologues
). This book club focuses on books about sex and sexuality, and Bonk definitely falls under that category. What the club doesn’t prescribe but Mary Roach does provide is a healthy helping of humour: in the book’s description, someone for The New Yorker describes her as “the funniest science writer in the country.” I was sceptical of such a superlative distinction, but it might be true—and if not, she’s up there on the podium.If you watched the first season of Showtime’s Masters and Sex you will know, somewhat, of what Roach discusses here. (I say the first season, specifically, because subsequent seasons have drifted further into soap opera territory and farther away from the science side of things—which is fine if you want soap opera, but not really my cup of tea.) Roach gives Masters and Johnson their due, of course, and she mentions other notorious scientists, like Alfred Kinsey. She also illuminates the field, though, mentioning names I hadn’t encountered: Robert Latou Dickinson, and women in the field, like Marie Bonaparte (she of the “I had my clitoris moved…”). And while Roach diligently details much of the history of sex research, she spends a great deal of the book talking about the state of the field right now. I found this very gratifying.I can’t speak for others (particularly those who live in less fortunate areas of the world, like the United States, where sex ed is paltry or non-existent) but I’ve always just kind of had the impression that our scientific knowledge of sex was pretty thorough and complete. We know, in other words, how babies are made. I knew we were still mucking about with genes and fertilization techniques, etc., but I didn’t pay much attention to other parts of the field. I guess I underestimated how much the pleasurable nature of sex for some people motivates us, as a species, to turn our curious and scientific minds to the process. The truth is, sex research is alive and well—but we just don’t talk about it as much as we should!Roach seems to have a few clear goals. Firstly, she sets out to demystify and dispel stigma around sex research (i.e., it’s not something scientists do because they have a perverted fascination with sex). Secondly, she tries to explore and explain the field without resorting to too much jargon (her explanations of complicated biological processes and surgical procedures are remarkably lucid and easy to follow). Thirdly, she points out areas of sex that have yet to be studied thoroughly enough. Although short, Bonk packs a punch when it comes to the sheer amount of information and number of topics Roach manages to cover. Also, the chapters themselves are short, making this a very easy book to read a little at a time.I appreciate the way Roach allays accusations that if you’re interested in talking about sex, or researching it in a lab, you must be a pervert. It seems like this should go without saying in 2016 (or 2008, when this book was written), what with the way we’re saturated in media by sex and sexuality. And hey, everyone wants to talk about sex—I’m not interested in having sex and I still want to talk about it. However, this is the peculiar double standard of our times: we are supposed to be interested in sex just enough, but if we are interested too little or too much, we are labelled as deviant. The amount of interest, and the way it should be expressed, varies with one’s gender, social status, age, etc. Slip up in any way and you get policed. Start talking or thinking about sex too young? Perverted. Someone must have “corrupted” your innocence. Start having sexual thoughts about the sex you’re not supposed to be attracted to in your community? Ugh, perverted! Did you start talking about sex, and are you a woman? The height of perversion!!I digress. And I jest—one theme that Roach unearths is how women’s sexuality has actually been acknowledged and studied in various ways throughout recorded history. Rather than a clear progression from “women do not enjoy sex” to “women enjoy sex but men don’t care” to “women enjoy sex and men should care,” we see a much more complicated, roller-coaster-ride journey as different societies grapple with the radical notion that women are people, and that they should enjoy their bodies as something other than childbearing vessels. And while we live in a very enlightened and privileged time (what with the Pill and all those fancy vibrators), we still have a ways to go.For all her openness (Roach is pretty candid about the times she had to volunteer herself as a participant to get access to the goings-on in a sex study), elements of Roach’s humour undermine her attempts to make us stop sniggering about sex. I conflicted about this. On one hand, I think Roach is just trying to dispel our discomfort using humour—by pointing it out and then dismissing it with a joke, we can focus on the science. On the other hand, I do feel like she is somewhat reinforcing the very ideas that she dismisses in her introduction; sometimes her jokes feel like they are implying that these researchers are unhealthily fascinated by what’s going on, or at least that there is something weird and freaky about studying the anatomy and biology of sex in humans. To be clear, I don’t think Roach is deliberately implying that—I just worry it’s a side effect of some of her humour.Bonk might be one of the most edifying books I’ve read in a while—and I read a lot, a fair amount of it non-fiction. The coy chapter titles conceal their contents well, but Roach covers a vast swathe of sex research. She looks at what we know about the role of the clitoris in orgasm before moving on to wondering what role the female orgasm’s biological manifestations plays in reproduction (answer: we’re still not sure). From there she talks a bit about how we can get a good look all up in there (vaginas; I’m talking about sticking cameras up people’s vaginas), before a few chapters on impotence (male and female) and the ways we can “fix” this (male and female). I say “fix” because Roach does point out that, for some people, it’s not actually a problem, and that there are communities and organizations somewhat concerned by the medicalization of sexuality—especially in women. Throughout this book I was constantly thinking about the controversy around “female Viagra”, a treatment Roach alludes to in the book but that has only recently come to fruition.This book also taught me many cool science tidbits I otherwise haven’t learned before. Vaginal lubricant isn’t glandular but actually the clear plasma component from the blood that fills the walls around the vagina. How cool is that?Roach seems to spend roughly equal time on vaginas and penises. For a book about sex, it’s not surprising that the subject falls into such a binary. To her credit, Roach does talk about trans people and gay people here and there—as far as Bonk is concerned, it’s mostly focused on the individual, who might have a penis or a vagina, rather than couples of any particular orientation. I found it most interesting that Roach does not even come near the debate over how biology, genetics, or environment might influence our sexual orientations—though I think she was probably right to stay away from that minefield. Overall, this is a book focused almost exclusively on biological parts of coupling rather than the cultural parts—though I don’t mean to suggest that biology presents us with straightforward binaries either. Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go on this front, when many researchers continue to talk about gender queerness in very medical terms and use “healthy” as a synonym for cisgender people. While Bonk doesn’t demonstrate these views, its findings are naturally restricted to what we have studied so far (and the framework around which we study them, as Roach herself points out when she describes the methodologies Masters and Johnson use with gay couples).That is, of course, the fantastic thing about science. The state of our knowledge is in continual flux: what we know changes every day, every moment, and can make us revise or revisit everything that came before. Bonk represents the state of our knowledge in 2008. It’s far from complete, and I’m sure parts of it are outdated or will be in coming years. But Roach does a great job pulling back the curtain on research into the bedroom, giving her readers a great primer on sex and science and leaving us with the right questions to ask going forward.

31,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael,4,"Bonk is a look into the history and study of sexual physiology. Mary Roach takes an interesting and humorous look into the world of sex research, exploring the weird methods used and the evolution of the field of study. Mary Roach has a unique style that has turned her into a household name. From a book about cadavers (Stiff), to more recently a look into the digestive track (Gulp).This is my first Mary Roach book and I was immediately drawn to her writing style. I have never read her before, but I have heard so many good things. It was a toss-up between starting with Bonk or Stiff, but I am happy to finally have a chance to experience her writing. The blend of humour while teaching about science makes her an author I need to read more from. She has a style that I have always been interested in adopting for my blog; a balance between teaching and entertaining. Sadly my blog has been nothing but book reviews lately but I hope this will change in the near future.I remember reading Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us by Jesse Bering a few years ago and found it completely fascinating. I wanted to learn more about the research side of sex but never read anything since then. While Perv looks at the psychological study of sex, Bonk focuses more on the physiological. There are so many topics to cover on the topic, so my biggest problem with Bonk is the fact that it was a very ‘broad-strokes’ approach to the topic. Although this is a good starting point to understand the science.I was a little horrified with all the setbacks that happened in the study of sex. Whether they are religious or cultural reasons, there has been a lot of times research falls years behind just to save face. This topic alone would be an interesting one to explore, not just about sex but research in general. I am sure there are many times where science suffers due to public opinion. I wonder if there is a book that covers this topic (if you know of one let me know).I am glad to have finally read Mary Roach and Bonk, I have discovered a new favourite author and a topic I need to learn more about. The more non-fiction I read, the more I wonder why I had an aversion towards it for so long. It was a non-fiction book that got me into reading and I am pretty much a non-fiction writer. I have so much to learn and I plan to learn more; hopefully this will reflect on my blog in the future. If you have an interest in reading about the research of sex both physiologically and psychologically, I recommend both Bonk and Perv.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev..."

The public is waiting to hear about a 55 year old man who reads a book about sex……Myself: Of course, this book is a fine representative of the erotic humorous descriptive popular science genre.Me: You just made that genre up didn't you?Myself: …… well …. Kind of.Me: Your daughter is your friend in Goodreads….. What will she think?Myself: She doesn't read all the crap that I write, and anyway she is used to being embarrassed by her father. Additionally, it will embarrass her only if one of her friends read it. Me: Whatever…… By the way, what language will you use?Myself: English of course, that’s the language I read the book in.Me: No, No, I mean, will you use the 'F' word and the 'C' word and the 'P' word and the 'WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE ACRONYMS ARE AMBIGUOUS' word? Myself: Of course not, I will use the language of the book, sentences like “When the clitoris is set very high the woman must take an attitude which accentuates pelvic inclination.”Or the following description of the woman's position in ""The Anterior-Lateral"" sex position taken from the book ""Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique"" written by the Dutch gynecologist Theodoor Van de Velde:the woman's position is described as “half-lateral, half-supine, with a corresponding half-lateral, half-superposed attitude of the man, which is possible by appropriate arrangement of pillows.”Me: okay, if you insist, go ahead.Myself:Haven't read such a hilarious book in years. The author, Mary Roach, presents us with a well-researched and insanely funny descriptions of various scientific aspects of sex, the methods of research, the history of research and the language used by the various parties to describe sexual related activities. While, it is clear from the book that she does respect the sexual research field and acknowledges its importance, she does not miss an opportunity to ridicule the topics of the research, the methods of research , some of the results, and mainly, the language that these results and methods are described in. A few examples of the language, I quoted above, and here are some more highlights from the book (I tried to find the short ones, many longer funny ones exist)“If one’s mouth is open when there is a sudden upsurge of erotic stimulation and response,” Kinsey writes, “saliva may be spurted some distance out of the mouth.”A quote from the 1935 edition of Sex Practice in Marriage: “Should a man be unable to restrain himself and have an orgasm before his wife, he must keep up the clitoris stimulation until his wife has reached the climax.”Some quotes from an information sheet given to volunteers for usage of ultrasound imaging in order to see what goes on ""in there"":""We are investigating whether this technique can be used to reveal more information on how various body parts work during various activities"" ""For a dry penile scan, a volunteer is asked to lie on the bed facing down, and place his penis through a hole in the bed into an artificial vagina. The ‘vagina’ is made of (harmless) starch jelly.”The book, has a chapter that describes some of the common believes in the mediaeval age, one of them, the phenomena of disappearing penis (apparently this was a problem then) was attributed to witchery, but don't worry there is a simple cure:The accursed man who seeks advice is invariably asked to give some thought to whom he believes might have bewitched him. He is then urged to “prudently approach” this person and to sit down and have a talk. “Soften her with gentle words.” Whereupon the penis generally reappears. As a Plan B, the learned tome recommends that the accursed “use some violence.”The author took a very hands on approach to the research (literally, and not only hands). She flew to Denmark to watch how pig inseminators cause orgasm in female pigs in order to increase fertility (9% increase if I remember correctly).She flew to Taiwan to interview a hotshot urological surgeon, (including hands on participation in the surgery)She had intercourse with her husband while connected to ultrasound imaging apparatus…… All the works.Bottom line:While this book does have practical information for those who insist, includes some amazing information that makes you say ""wow, do Inuit's really use walrus penis bones as clubs"", this book is a funny and witty, laugh from page one to the last of the footnotes.Me: That's it????????

33,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"The eminent sage and philosopher Donald Rumsfeld once said ""As we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know."" Now I never gave that phrase much thought, other than requisite snort of derision, until recently when I began listening to the audiobook for Mary Roach's Bonk. It was only then that I understood the scope of what Rummie, in his standard garbled manner, was talking about.You see, I know that I don't know a lot of things. I know that I don't know the distance from Earth to the Sun, the mating ritual of the ladybug, why Lady GaGa refuses to wear pants, or why tortillas are the most perfect thing to wrap food in. It wasn't until reading Bonk, though, that I realized that I didn't even know that I didn't know about such wonderful things as vaginal upsuck, teleclitoridians, porcine foreplay, scrotal moles, or the scientific studies that were performed to study these delightful subjects. Oh brave new world, that has such things in it!With her customary self-deprecation and humorous asides, Roach dives deep into the world of the sexual sciences. A very skilled researcher, Roach simultaneously looks back to the dawn of reproductive study, through the titillating studies on the female orgasm performed by the sadly unsatisfied Princess Bonaparte, the modern studies of Alfred Kinsey and Masters & Johnson, and out into the future. Written in a very conversational manner (helped greatly by the fact that I listened to the audiobook), the book proved to be one of the most interesting thigns I've read all year. The only complaint I can muster is that Roach sometimes tends to skimp on the details in the chapters where I was most interested and then piles them on in the segments where I could stand for some things to be glossed over (ie- the description of skinning the penis prior to inserting an implant). Even so, this is nitpicking. The book is eminently enjoyable, a proper followup to Stiff that has me curious about her other book, Spook.If the above hasn't already either piqued your interest or sent you running in the opposite direction, you can watch Roach speak on the same themes in the following clip recorded at the annual TED conference:TED Talks: Mary Roach- 10 Things You Didn't Know About Orgasms (possibly NSFW)"
34,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9104633-jason,5," Disclaimer: This review is highly male oriented  this book has everything sex in every form... every cringe worthy, OMG, terrified, and enlightening aspect of such a wonderful experience (uuuuu....sually....)   (fertility statue)from what makes people tick sexually (hormones, positions, and implications on sexual function and arousal, etc)  To the anatomy—muscles, structure, non-typical reactions, biology, spinal cord injuries and their impact on sexual relations—. An assortment of horrifyingly stunning—scope, findings and WTF moments—, and fascinating procedures. Procedures explored within are a unique balance of the dated and archaic and more modern ones.  the starting revelations and findings arising from the use of old technology, as well as advanced modern approaches (mri machines and ultrasounds)An assortment of complications pertaining to sex, involving an endless array of constellations and configurations  The exploration of psychology and sex Together these themes culminate into the typical approach Mary takes in writing her odd little gems. Frustrations abound for the less ADHD crowd. It skips around the main theme, providing related evidence, historical context, as well as not so relevant information that in the end somehow fits. For example, she will be undergoing a procedure about female arousal and anxiety disorders and will detour this subjective experience to additions related material, then sweep back to the exam. This isn't difficult for someone who is used to this sort of puzzled pieces approach. Also, this book, as well as all of her other works is heavy in research. This book does not mess around with the trivial, mundane, or lighter side of science. It explores the less known, cringe worthy, and darker parts of science in a classic Roach style.  Pretty much summaries my personal, subjective response to   Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex  It's ultimately is all about its sex.... all things about sex... some things you may not know and some things you never wanted to know. The chapters on the penis demonstrate this.  The chapter that circles around the quote ""'I better get home or the ducks—I still have trouble walking next to ponds—will have something to eat.”  caused a fair amount of anxiety and discontent and had me covering my junk throughout (I KID YOU NOT, AND FOR THE MOST PART THIS WAS A AUTOMATIC, UNCONTROLLABLE REACTION). I'll leave you to find out the meaning of this quote, but if you have a willy you will surely be doing the same thing. In the end the chapter titled  The Taiwanese Fix and the Penile Pricking Ring: Creative approaches to impotence  had no subjective relevance prior to reading, but may be a temporary side effect from reading this book. I fear the consequences of this book and on 'Clark Kent' (give me a break i was young when it got its name). Thankfully this hasn't been the case YET, but I will admit that I have at times, particularly shortly after finishing this, quietly critiqued and examined 'things'. There have been a number of times when my thoughts have quietly expressed disbelieve and awe at what is happening during the... task.. event.... experience. Hopefully my mind and body don't drift too much in opposite directions, because honestly the tests of a males' member and arousal throughout this book seems way to painful to endure. Thankfully 'Clark Kent' seems to have enough stamina and association with the ID to overrule my analytical mind. But it may prove too much for poor 'Clark Kent'."
35,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321324-meg,1,"I just read this one in my book club and I am here to tell you that book clubs are not just for ladies bored with cookie exchanges and Tupperware parties or for those with a hall pass to get drunk and catty. In fact I recently joined one filled with funny Kindergarten moms who happen to like wine, a lot, and chocolate (which happens to be brought in Tupperware) while talking about a lot of things, including good books.We recently sought out a book about sex. We didn't really need a how-too manual (though we agreed that if we found one, it could be strategically left out for our partners.) We wanted something to spice up a dark Chicago winter and also provide some practical information about sex. After chatting-up our local bookstore owner, we delved into Bonk by Mary Roach. Bonk is advertised as a witty overview of the study of the science of sex. This choice seemed to fit right in with our repertoire of not-quite how-to non-fiction book choices by witty female authors, such as MFK Fisher's How to Cook a Wolf. But unfortunately it was neither witty nor did it deliver any recipes for how to achieve a vaginal orgasm. We unanimously criticized Bonk for its sophomoric commentary and haphazard litany of sex studies, and it became the first book that the group came to a consensus on--it sucked. Roach misses the mark on describing the ebb and flow of sex research and doesn't even make the reader feel sexy.We did read that Marie Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte's niece, made great strides in identifying the starring role of the clitoris in female orgasms, (she surgically moved her own twice to optimize hers!) Yet our mothers' generation barely even knew what a clitoris was. This begs the question, what happened to sex research in the intervening hundred years? Perhaps an editor, or even an outline, would have helped Roach organize the studies into an interesting portrait of sex research and help us understand our generation's relationship to sex.If it wasn't enough to disappoint an entire group of sun-starved Chicago women in January, my husband might have been most offended. He is secretly jealous of our book club for its flavorful mix of smart people and compelling reading list. He was especially happy about this month's book choice because according to his man logic, WIFE + SEX BOOK=LOTS OF SEX. However after the first two nights of squirming uncomfortably while I recounted stories of men ejaculating with toothbrushes up their urethras, or explaining how sows need foreplay from their handlers for successful insemination, he quickly decided that working late would be more productive.The unfortunate side effects of the book like the absence of pork products in our kitchen and the sharp increase in sexless nights drove him to read the Internet. And after I shared one last detail about penile implants he retaliated with a video about duck vaginas. In this YouTube video, Isabella Rosellini (obviously in full duck dress) explains how a duck's vagina is a labyrinth. Lady ducks can either steer duck penises to mecca and fertilize the egg or to a deserted dead-end. In essence she can reserve the baby-daddy status for her prince charming instead of the first duck to mount her. How handy! With the idea that Rosellini's cinematic choices might make a better book club topic this month, I forwarded the video. Alas the subject ""Green Porn,"" made more people think it was a Canadian pharmacy selling viagra than actually watch it.Despite my failure to detour the book club conversation, we did not waste much of our time talking about Roach's book, but we did cover our experiences with strip clubs, jerk shacks, birth control, and porn. The night ended as any night might with a group of Moms who spent a few hours with a few drinks talking about sex--""Can you believe this crazy thing that came out of MY vagina?""* *(Our Kids)"

43,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,This is a funny and informative book about sex and science. It is also a bit disturbing and gross in parts. 
44,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"Mary Roach's Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex is a book about sex. Well, sort of. It's not erotica. Or a how-to manual. Or an exploration of sexuality in our culture. Or an examination of sex in the media. Rather, while it does touch briefly on some of those topics, Bonk is the history of the scientific study of sex. It's also very funny.You may be unsurprised to find out that sex as a research subject has a history of taboos and upturned noses once you stray outside of reproductive and making babies territory. Studying the practical plumbing of the human reproductive system is generally on this side of acceptable, though Roach does point out that aspiring gynecologists used to have to learn their crafts by working on cadavers and even when graduating up to the real thing they had to work by feel without looking. But the study of sex and sexuality for their own sake is more hush-hush and got a much slower start thanks in no part to the many weird and unconventional places it goes.And go there you shall, curious reader. Roach is fearless and unapologetic in her exploration of the field, and she shines her light right up into some pretty shocking places. This was both great and not so great for me. For example, I found the chapters on sex machines and the people who make them weirdly fascinating, and the chapter where Roach talks her husband into experiencing first hand (so to speak) a study that used ultrasound machines to get cross-sections of their coital act was hilariously awkward. She also throws herself into the research in other places, such as touring a prosthetics factory (and by ""prosthetics"" I mean ""prosthetics"" here), and getting personal with attendees of a meeting people who build homemade sex machines. But then again, there was only so much discussion I could take when it came to monkey orgasms, genital surgery, and other things I'd rather not even write about here. I'm no prude, but it didn't take long for me to get my fill of those topics, which Roach goes into with incredible detail.The best part of the book, though, is Roach's style, because she is the most entertaining science writer I've come across this side of Bill Bryson. She is possessed of a sharp wit and great sense of humor about all this, which goes a long way towards keeping the weird and traditionally private topics approachable and easier to relate to. And it's not of the sophomoric ""boobies, tee hee!"" variety, either (well, sometimes, but not often). Instead, Roach makes effective use of footnotes and asides to make jokes about not only the people she's reporting on, but also to make self-deprecating quips at her own expense since she's not as far out there as the people she's researching. In short, Roach manages just the right mixture of factual science reporting and wry humor. I laughed out loud many times during this book, and that's got to count for something."
45,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,5,"This book is just as much about researchers' struggle to get funding for and effectively carry out research on sex as it is about the findings of the sex research. As someone who also does research on rather ""taboo"" subjects, I instantly connected with the scientists' struggles and attempts to break out of stigma, all the while coating their research in highly jargony terms to get it approved for funding.This, coupled with Mary Roach's witty style of writing and obviously genuine enjoyment of the subject (and the path the book took her down) make for a wonderfully entertaining book that will appeal to scientists and laymen alike.Also, a kudos to Ms. Roach for not only referring to Leonardo Da Vinci correctly as ""Leonardo,"" but also for including a footnote explaining that this IS the correct way to refer to the artist. It gladdened my art history minor heart and endeared Mary Roach to me forever."

And for the most part it was pretty hilarious. I had some problems with it thought. I felt like I spent the whole book waiting for her get to the point about people having different kinds of sex. The book, supposedly, is about sex. But it's never really clear how she defines sex. She (and scientists) seem to be working mostly from a sex-as-intercourse assumption. This was most clearly illustrated when she and her husband volunteered to have sex in a lab so scientists could take an MRI of it. But then when she described it, it really didn't sound like what i think of as sex at all. I don't want to project feelings on to her too much, but it didn't sound like she was involved or turned on by it at all. It didn't sound like two people having sex. The way she described it, it sounded like she could have been a doll that her husband was having intercourse with. Orgasm was certainly never mentioned in that scenario.Point being, she spend a lot of time talking about the mechanics of sex, but what IS sex exactly? There are so many different kinds, and she really only talks about intercourse and the orgasms that come therefrom. At the very tiny little squeak of an end she mentions queer sex (or ""homosexual,"" as she very clinically puts it), but only as an aside to illustrate that Masters & Johnson found that queer people have better sex than straight people. But does she go on to say anything more about queer people or queer sex? No no. Instead she talks about the implications of this tidbit for straight people. You can practically hear the underlying ""we"" when she talks about how far ""heterosexuals have come"" (no pun?). No mention of any of the implications for queer people. There's so much othering going on I almost can't keep track of it all.It is shocking to me that a book that purports to be about sex has such a severely limited definition of what sex entails. When I got to the chapter about implants and sexual modification I thought that surely, finally, there would be a mention of queer people, at the very least of people who have undergone gender reassignment surgery. NOTHING! It's appalling. The book is funny and entertaining, but for a book that claims to be about sex, it is heterosexist and cisgenderist (is that even a word?) in the extreme. Not even just heterosexist, interesting-sex-ist (e.g No discussion of all the different ways for just straight ppl to have sex other than intercourse). Disappointing."

If I'd recorded the soundtrack of me reading this it would be full of giggles, gasps, oh my gods and ewws. Anyone listening would assume I was Bonking, instead of reading about it. Mary Roach fully immerses herself in her research, even taking part in some studies to experience the experiments for herself. I feel for her husband. Being married to her can mean finding yourself chatting to a strange man watching you having sex with your mad wife inside an MRI machine.Her witty commentary on the history of sex research shows the people behind the white coats weren't all perverts and had a genuine scientific curiosity about sex, the most taboo subject in the world no matter time or place you live in. The negative effect this had on both their careers and their personal lives was sometimes staggering. However, some of the experiments on animals...err...well, they were uncomfortable to read. Roach only reported on the humane ones but even those -I was questioning where the line between science and bestiality is, if there is one. I'm sorry, researchers but there was a gigantic EWW! moment involving a female primate. It was too weird.Being female I was most interested in the female chapters than the male which tended to drag for me although penis re-attachment surgery was most...enlightening. *coughs to hide smile*Certain statistics, anecdotes and trivia (e.g. items removed from naughty places that can't be explained without embarrassment) were spread throughout the book, many of which were in the footnotes so whatever you do, pay attention to those even if you, like some, don't particularly like Roach's writing. Her sense of humour won't be to everyone's taste, for me it's more hit than miss but I can understand why some see it as forced, trying too hard to evoke a laugh from her audience.In an ideal world I'd want to give this to teenagers as part of their sex education. Anyone who might assume this is just some smutty perverted book just by looking at the cover, is wrong. Neither is it dry and boring, there will be no Zzzz's whilst reading this. If anything I'd warn people: You must have a strong stomach. There are graphic descriptions of surgical procedures that will have you involuntarily crossing your legs in sympathy.So if you want to read about how men get erections, why some women orgasm and others don't then this book is for you. Have fun and try not to puke."
51,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65207-shannon,5,"Mary Roach is ridiculously readable. The following are the quotes in the book that made me lol. (Keep in mind, I am weird. The first one isn't even supposed to be funny, but out of context- it makes me laugh, for some reason).""Archibald concedes that the machines represent a stereotypically male notion of what women enjoy."" ""The job of a production pig is to produce more pigs, as many pigs as pigly possible.""""Perhaps I would decipher the secret language of pigs.""""Who clubs a hamster?""""'I am increasingly wretched.'""""I want to trip him, not out of meanness, but just to see the penises fly through the air and rain down around us.""Okay, so they are all taken out of context, but I like it better that way.And note: the pig quotes are courtesy of a chapter on pig-stimulation. Totally creepy/gross. Yet informative.So, yay to Roach for discussing topics I'd never heard of at all. Not like I'm a massive sexual deviant, but I've taken plenty of sexual diversity classes in college and all that nonsense, and they all seem to cover more or less the same ground. Roach, being the investigator-journalist that she is, discusses issues that I'd previously never even heard of (again: pig stimulation- with the purpose of creating as many pigs as pigly possible. Heh. ""Pigly"".)Also- She discusses the Master's and Johnson's studies, of course, which is a pretty widely examined study, but mentions a fact that I'd never heard of before (but have always known, deep in my heart, intuitively): ""The best sex going on in Master's and Johnson's lab was the sex being had by the committed gay and lesbian couples. Not because they were practicing special secret homosexual sex techniques*, but because they 'took their time.'"" HA. Even Master's and Johnson, who did not approve of homosexuality (their Homosexuality in Perspective paper was largely about how to convert gays to the far less glorious [not an insult, I'm just saying: scientifically speaking] heterosexual lifestyle) had to concede that the gaysex was the best sex. Oh man Mary Roach, as if I wasn't enough of a gay-elitist now I'm going to go around telling everyone that gay sex is scientifically better. SAYS SCIENCE. So: YOU SHOULD READ THIS. The end.*But they were, totally."
52,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"Curiosity seems to be Mary Roach's raison d'etre, and bless her heart for that.In our culture, especially outside the hallowed halls of science and academia, sex is viewed as titillating and scandalous -- not to be talked about, no matter the context. And while I'm not going to get political here -- because I super hate it when people do that in inappropriate places -- I think that's a huge detriment to our culture, and to us as participants in that culture. So props to Mary Roach for writing this book, and for making it so dang readable.Bonk chronicles Roach's investigations into the long and interesting history of science and sex. Specifically it's a funny and matter of fact history of people who -- like Roach -- were curious about sex and the way things worked, and decided to do something about it. The book is pretty large in scope, covering everything from Alfred Kinsey to bicycle dildo cameras. In a couple of memorable incidents, she even goes so far as to make herself (and her good-sprited husband) research subjects when it becomes clear that she won't be able to witness experiments in any other way.It's been almost a month since I finished this book, so the details have largely slipped my mind, but what remains memorable (aside from a few details that I will make sure to pop out at inappropriate times disguised as small talk) is the way that Roach insists on asking the questions that everyone wants to know but are too embarrassed to ask.This was my second Mary Roach book (finished Stiff a couple weeks later) after reading Packing For Mars last year, and although she definitely has a formula at this point, it's a fun formula, and I'm in for whatever wacky avenue of inquiry she thinks up next. I totally want to hang out with her and go on weird research adventures, but I guess reading her books are the next best thing."
53,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"A cheery analysis of how and why scientists have observed, recorded, and theorized about human sex behavior, since gynecologist Robert Dickinson’s case studies in the 1890s, through the Masters and Johnson reach, Kinsey’s questionnaires, Marie Bonaparte’s studies on the relation of clitoral position to enjoyment of sex, and so on. Roach travels to Denmark where she observes pig inseminators sexually stimulating the sows for better results; watches penile enhancement surgery in Taipei; peeks into the small and unsettling world of sex machine hobbyists; interviews the maker of a suction device for women (to increase blood flow to the clitoris); discusses the strange history of testicle grafts; and opens many other windows into the vast array of human sexuality. Stuffed with the kind of tidbits of information that make you cross your legs and squirm (there is a great deal of historical insertions of objects into urethras, for example), and told in vivid, bold, often hilarious prose, this is a hugely entertaining book. It’s not exactly a definitive study of human sexuality, being wide in scope but not deep and with very little in the way of general thesis; however, Roach’s winking, irreverent prose style, her wisecracks, and her wordplay set this book in the highest ranks of popular science surveys. "
54,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,5,"A hilarious recounting of the sexual escapades of scientific researchers. Ms. Roach takes all the dryness out of sexual research on humans, and a few other species as well, and puts the fun back into it. Some of the anecdotes do seem taken out of the pages of the “National Enquirer”.But the stories are “fresh” in all senses of that word. I actually learnt even more about very special organs (penis and clitoris) and special activities (orgasm). Yes Ms. Roach’s account is uninhibited and I was thankful as I was reading with a weird smirk that no one asked me – “Hey what are you reading?!”"
55,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Not as good as Stiff, but soooooo close. Much better than Spook! A big part of why I love Mary Roach is that she writes readable books on topics I’m intensely interested in. We have the same zeal for the weird and the verboten, and she makes satisfying my own curiosity so much easier by doing the research I can’t. And god, is she funny. Her humour fell flat in Spook but I think Bonk’s humour is the best of the three I’ve read so far. Undoubtedly part of it is the illicit thrill of reading about sex that makes you want to giggle like a preteen at every joke. I was defs blushing and giggling for a good part of this book, and smiling for the rest. "
56,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,3,"Sex is far more than the sum of its moving partsAs always this was very entertaining and informative. Some of the suprises was a full chapter on princess Marie Bonaparte (Napoleon's niece), and the repeated appearances of dr.Watson (the behavioral psychologist) in a book about sex research. I really appreciated the fact that Mary Roach and her husband participated in some of the experiments - that's dedication for you. "
57,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32278959-leslynn,2,"There are great facts and case studies in this book, and many LOL moments, but dear book:And you went on for so long that I had to say:"
58,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa,3,"Not as good as Stiff, this book really dragged in parts. She reminds me a lot of A.J. Jacobs; funny, but sometimes it's just too much bother to keep reading."
59,0393334791,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,5,I love Mary Roach. Science + sex + snark + one of the few nonfiction writers who can make me laugh out loud.
