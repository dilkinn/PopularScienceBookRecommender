0,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385685-diana,4,"You don't have to be well versed in statistics to enjoy Blastland and Dilnot's book The Tiger That Isn't. Their aim is to teach their readers how to criticality examine and understand statistical claims in the news. Using a plethora of sometimes amusing, sometimes troubling examples they show how the government, the media, and special interest groups can misunderstand and misrepresent statistical analyses. I enjoyed this book and found it quite an eye opener. It's pretty scary how often statistical results are knowingly misrepresented for effect or gain. Just as often studies are incorrectly presented through ignorance.Using simple arithmetic Bestland and Dilnot provide a few easy methods for detecting whether a statistical claim is outrageous or realistic. This book is perfect for people with just a basic mathematical background who want to learn to question the statistics they read. For those with more robust mathematical backgrounds many of the statistical concepts might be very simple, but I believe they might still enjoy the numerous examples of statistical studies being twisted to support various agendas. "
1,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67312834-riccardo,3,"There are three types of lies : lies, damned lies and statistics. Mark Twain- well maybeMichael Blastland gives us a modern an up to date reminder of why we should not believe all the statistics we read. It is a rather topical book in the current COVID epidemic where we have seen a wholesale abuse of data. Michael runs through a number of very interesting examples of the abuse and misuse of data. It is well written and entertaining. My one criticism is that it focuses excessively on examples from England, and might have benefited from a more global perspective. Many of the examples from the British health service or from British politics are not very interesting to the non English reader. None the less it is well worth reading, and will probably warrant an extra chapter once the dust settles on COVID."

"
3,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,5,"I first read this book in 2008, not all that long after it was released, pretty much in one go on a long haul flight. I recently came across it again, remembered the pleasure I derived from it the first time round, and so gave it a re-read.The Tiger That Isn’t provides a competent grounding in the very basics of statistical theory – risk, sampling, averages, etc – but does so in a way that is both relevant to daily life and, genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny. Blastland and Dilnot pick examples from many different spheres of life, but with a particular lean towards politics and the media, and explain the basic statistical errors underlying fallacious claims. They largely succeed in doing this in a lighthearted way, and attempt to equip readers with tools which might help them avoid similar mistakes in future.One suggestion that I remembered from my first reading of this book is that any Government spending announcement is more easily interpreted if one divides the headline figure by 3bn, which gives an approximation of the spend per member of the population per week.Of course, this book does not discuss statistical methods in great detail, and nor does it deal with some of the more complex statistical concepts. It does, however, give a good grounding in everyday statistics to those with a passing interest – I wish more journalists (and politicians) would give themselves a solid foundation of statistical understanding, and this is as good a place to start as any.I very much enjoyed my re-read of this volume, and would happily recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the topic.This review was originally published on my blog, at http://sjhoward.co.uk/archive/2014/02..."
4,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6424859-dominic-carlin,4,"Rather than devoting a few hours to reading a book about the fallacious (or downright deceptive) use of statistics, most weeks I limit myself to listening to the BBC's More or Less podcast. Despite that, it's probably still worth reading a book like The Tiger That Isn't once every few years, even if I am somewhat mathematically literate. That's probably just as well. These books tend to come out quite often. Now maybe I would have been better off reading 'Calling Bullshit', released this month by noted - and in the times of COVID, the really rather topical - epidemiologist Carl Bergstrom, but a book by the initial brains behind the More or Less show? How could I resist!Nothing in The Tiger that Isn't is conceptually new. We've all heard the phrase ""lies, damn lies and statistics."" Most of us have probably heard that correlation does not equal causation too. Those in the UK have also probably heard of the infamous NHS deficit too. One of the main lessons of The Tiger That Isn't - a lesson that's really worth repeating - is to drill down into the numbers and make sense of them. The NHS's most recent deficit came to £571m. Is that a big number? It sure sounds like it. But how does that compare to the NHS's actual budget? Well, it turns out that £571m comes out to an overspend of around about 0.4%. Is that a big number? Not so much.To some people, any amount of overspend is too much. A perfectly reasonable stance to take. But the debate over the NHS deficit goes some way to illustrate just how numbers can be manipulated and mislead. The Tiger That Isn't is full of such examples which, even 13 years later, still bear relevance. As the UK prepares to release A Level grades based on estimates based on a sample of the past 3 years of results, it's worth remembering that private schools consistently have an intake of advantaged kids with stable upbringings and better educational resources at home. That inner city comprehensive? Their results are more susceptible to variation in any one individual or cohort's performance. A particularly gifted cohort this summer which follows 3 years of fluctuating - but ultimately average - academic performance? Well, it's obvious which of these schools is most likely to miss out.As the Tiger That Isn't goes to great pains to point out, these averages mask a great many sins. When, where and how you draw a sample and how you illustrate the result matters. Yet despite this, outliers can still exist and data can still confound. The examples used in The Tiger That Isn't may be dated, but the principles outlined remain just as relevant today. Clearly and simply illustrated, they can be applied by pretty much anybody, making it a book worthy of anyone's time."
5,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27785844-edward-janes,4,"Geeking out with this book about the value of statistics but the need to be cynical of data too. Not so much academic as full of anecdotes (eg how the average pregnancy length/projected due data should be 283 days not 280), metaphors (how sampling is like trying to drink from a firehose), and incorrect assumptions (how less splatted hedgehogs on roads may not be a sign of fewer hedgehogs but less traffic)."
6,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10175216-hrishikesh,3,A badly written collection of excellent ideas. The authors impart great clarity as to how numbers are to be UNDERSTOOD. A helpful guide in these data-crazy times. My gripe is that the authors try to be unnecessarily and excessively nformal at times.
7,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5894103-jo,5,Excellently written accessible even for a doctor with very little brain - a lot of the examples and illustrations are around health - a great introduction to sceptical thinking about statistics. 
8,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6814606-lisa,4,"Maths for the layman. Simple language, practical examples. Well demonstrated points. "
9,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60999179-tansy-hepton,3,Easy read from the presenter of More or Less (which I always enjoy). Clear examples and explanations - a great read for someone who thinks they don't understand numbers or is easily bamboozled. 
10,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"This pre-Crash somewhat polemic introduction to the use and misuse of statistics in public policy and the media comes from the creators of the estimable and corrective Radio 4 Programme More or Less.Since it was published, More or Less has been a rational thorn in the side of Government officials, campaigning NGOS and tabloid editors who misuse data knowing or unknowingly for their own purposes.The book is a primer on or perhaps manifesto for sensible thinking about what numbers can and cannot do and we should worry if, eight years on, the basic lessons have not been learned by Government.Every day shows us that the Press and the almost sociopathic NGOs have not learned any lessons at all. At least the two people authoring this book were standing up for intellectual integrity in 2007.Unfortunately the book is written as if it was a leisurely radio broadcast, conversationally steering an unsatisfactory line between populism and the scientific method. I wanted tighter editing and a less easy-going style with the space saved given over to more examples of public policy error and campaigning manipulation.In the end, the style, like radio, makes the narrative a little forgettable. It does not stick in the mind as a set of techniques for critiquing public policy. Those techniques are what we really want.Perhaps I am being unfair because a polemic may have been required in the dying days of the manipulative political culture constructed by New Labour. We have since moved on -though not as far as we could.More or Less has, since then, created a very substantial body of work. It has developed a significant and educated listenership so perhaps it might not need to be written in quite this way today.What struck me, however, was that the authors seemed terribly reluctant to stick the knife into the carcase of our political culture very deep. It was as if they did not want to burn their bridges.What is needed now is something more brutal than this book. We need an investigation not of our ignorance but of the will to manipulate ignorance and the wider failure to educate us out of ignorance.My reading of this book is not that people are stupid but that they are human, overwhelmed by data. They should be able to trust those they elect, give money to or who supply their information. They cannot.The problem is only partly a matter of better education (in which the authors play their part). It is equally an issue of politics. The public should not have to become statisticians to protect itself. The emphasis on us protecting ourselves is the wrong one - it is the elite, Government, NGO and media, that have to be brought to account.Every time a Government or NGO or corporation or newspaper manipulates data to sell something - a policy, a cause, a product or a story - they should be called out. This book pulled its punches. "
11,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470798-michael,4,"Really outstanding stuff - this is a summary of the problems with statistics, and particularly with the way they're reported in the mainstream media. Blastland and Dilnot (the latter author being cruelly removed from the book's record on goodreads.com) produced a Radio 4 show about statistics called 'More or Less', and this book is a summary of some of the major issues they encountered.I found it a truly fascinating read - it loses a star because some of the later chapters aren't as compelling as the early ones. The chapters on Correlation and Comparison tend to rehash the points that have already been made in the book, and seem like a weak conclusion for such a strong opening.The chapter on 'Averages' is truly remarkable, and should be an essential read for every voting individual. Once you understand what is meant by the word ""average"", a lot of claims by politicians need to be viewed in an entirely different light. As the authors themselves say at one point, the word ""average"" has taken on negative connotations - but, when it comes to things like the average income (measured as the mean), around two-thirds of the population are below the average.Similarly, the chapter on 'Targets', and the way that, in particular, British hospitals have ""gamed"" the system to achieve their targets, while not necessarily providing the best possible medical care for their patients, should be an essential read for voters and politicians.Overall, a fascinating insight into the damned lies of statistics!"
12,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59563411-dima-yousef-jadaan,4,"This is a well-researched and illuminating book intended, as the authors say, for ""consumers of numbers"". Its aim is to explain where statistics and numbers that we hear and read in the media everyday come from and how they fit into the real world. To that end, I believe the book did achieve its goal. It has great examples of how numbers can be misinterpreted and misused and provides readable formulae-free explanations about what those numbers really mean.I found the chapters explaining size (how numbers ending in ""illions"" are not necessarily big) and averages (how they don't necessarily represent the ""normal"" or what is typical) as well as the chapters on ""Targets"" and ""Risks"" very well-written with lots of relevant eye-opening examples. The chapter explaining Chance, however, was less well-written and I'd expect some readers to find it confusing. I come from a background in epidemiology and statistics, and thus, I am really well-versed in probability and chance. Yet, I didn't find the chapter explaining them the best on the subject.Overall, the book is written in an intelligent yet understandable style. However, I did find the writing at few times long-winded, heavy, and distracting. As another reviewer suggested, it is advisable to read the book in small chunks. But that doesn't make the book any less valuable and I do recommend it not only for ""consumers of numbers"" but also producers of numbers, journalists, politicians, decision-makers, as well as teachers."
13,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277552-matt,5,"A guide to thinking critically about numbers. Clear, accessible, thought-provoking, and insightful, The Tiger That Isn't is a must-read. It makes the case that one doesn't have to be mathematically gifted to make sense of the seemingly baffling stream of statistics that we both demand and fear. Instead, it shows how numbers can be made meaningful by making them personal, how averages might not mean what we think they do (as it points out, most of us have an above-average number of feet), what numbers hide as well as show, and what questions to ask of the numbers we find presented on the news and in our media. It's a fascinating primer, teaching not only essential skills, but also showing up common misunderstandings and errors. Richard Dawkins' used a term when describing his book The God Delusion, which aimed to promote rational and critical thought on the subject of religion: consciousness-raising. This book is a perfect example of consciousness-raising; it provides the tools to allow readers to think critically about numbers, and make decisions unobstructed by superstition and doubt. Can't recommend it enough."
14,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4750117-georgina,3,"This book was very clear in the maths knowledge it bestowed on its readers, and it did not require a great deal of already-established knowledge to be able to understand what it was trying to tell you. It really was a big eye-opener into the world of statistics which is around us everyday; yes, you might already be aware that the data that you read in the newspapers isn't the most accurate, but do you realise just how wrong that data could be? The book aims to bring out the main errors that are picked up in everyday maths which should be easy enough to pick out and yet out of apathy for maths or just an unwillingness to get to grips with the numbers that are there, the errors are often portrayed as if they weren't errors at all across newspapers, newsreels and in day-to-day life. Blastland shows that you don't need to be a genius at maths, just to understand the numbers that are thrown at you every single day, however daunting they may seem at first."
15,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216852-zach,4,"I really enjoyed this book - A very straight forward look at statistics and how they are often misused to shape our opinions and beliefs about the world. It offers a good basic understanding of statistical analysis that offers insight into what commonly reported numbers mean (and don't mean). I know I certainly read the daily newspaper with a little more attention to reported stats. To be fair, the authors really do believe in the usefulness of statistical analysis, they simply argue that you must know what you're looking at and constantly ask questions about the results. Don't worry it doesn't take a math degree to read it. In fact, it is relatively light on the inerworkings of stats. In short, a good quick easy read that hopefully well help us not get fooled by the numbers we are constantly bombarded with.Zach"
16,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5559110-aastha-madhur,5,"The book was suggested by a team member for a book review project. While initially sceptical I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The title is apropos to the theme and overall content of the book as it encourages people to demystify the figures being thrown at them w.r.t. various issues and try and get a more realistic assessment of what the numbers actually represent. Being concise, it encourages the average and reluctant reader to pick it up. Its been written in a simple and clear language addressing primarily a novice audience; so no experience or prior knowledge of even rudimentary statistics is required in order to read and grasp the significant points made in the book. Don't get me wrong, it won't give you a complete and exhaustive hold of the world of numbers :) but it would definitely pique your interest to an extent, that you may no longer be afraid of the tiger that isn't."
17,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,4,"A great follow-up to ""How to Tell Lies with Statistics"". I think these two books are an easy starting point for anyone who missed taking statistics in school. If you check out the table of contents on Amazon, you'll see a rough overview of what it's all about. It's a walkthrough of all the basic info you need to consider when you meet a number. And that reminds me to tell you the most important lesson from the book: size does matter. :)PS The second-listed author does a podcast on BBC called ""More or Less"". Some material in the book was inspired by or taken from that show. You'll want to give it a listen after reading this book when you become hooked on statistics and numbers."
18,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57593551-david-pereira,3,"Interesting and as the book points out - some of the points made in this book about ""guesstimates"" being touted as real numbers in the media are probably not as accurate as they make them out to be. A little common sense and a bit more thought could dismiss half of the stats results that are used to back wild claims about the status of the government, country, NHS.. etcIt was O.K, didn't fascinate me or push me to turn the page. Tbh felt like some of the subject chosen were to... big. the language at times was not straight forward or easy to follow. This is my own experience of course and different ignorance levels apply here."
19,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2879463-jane,4,"If ever assigned to teach research, this book will be required reading. The authors broke statistics into basic elements for chapters and provided insight into the challenges of data collection and analysis. Perhaps the most powerful lesson was to put numbers into a form of personal meaning. This skill alone would assist any student of statistics and research to better critically review research. I read the review for this book in The Economist magazine some time ago. It was on my shelf throughout a course in advanced statistics and modeling. I regret I waited until now to read it."
20,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,2,"This book makes very light, easy reading. It has great merit in introducing some key concepts on interpretating and understanding how statistics are reported and (mis)used. However, I found that it made the same points over and over again, and many of them would be rather obvious to anyone with any sort of mathematical or scientific backgound or, frankly, common sense. Dare I say it: a good book for someone arts educated who has never had an interest in mathematical or scientific reasoning but wants to get better at seeing through newspaper headlines."
21,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50687491-carolyn-lochhead,4,"This book made me feel surprised, more informed, and a little bit ashamed. Surprised, because it asserts that many people and organisations who might be expected to be statistically literate are nothing of the kind. More informed, because that assertion means I'll be more sceptical of media and political claims that statistics demonstrate the truth of their argument. And a little bit ashamed, because I have occasionally been guilty of mild selective statistical quoting myself. Still, now I know I'm in good company..."
22,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23394483-sara,3,"Pros: Clear, concise, simple to follow and very organised. I learn stats, but this book served as a good reminder of common fallacies as well as some others I wasn't so familiar with or hadn't seen this definitively outlined before.Cons: The occasionally angry, dismissive and/or condescending attitude to certain groups and types of people, even the reader (though somewhat justified in some cases). But I am nitpicking a little and this might not matter so much to others."
23,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250471-john,3,"This book isn't the best written I've read, but it somehow comes alive nonetheless - it's a wonderful reminder that numbers aren't something to be afraid of and that statistics can lead you wrong if you don't understand them properly. If you've already read How to Lie with Statistics and want more, this is for you."
24,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509714-alasdair,3,This was a very interesting read - enlightening about some basic principles that are easy to forget. The examples are mostly interesting and drawn from everyday life in the UK. It really gives an insight into how we make policy errors and shocking headlines - often with no substance behind the figures.
25,1861978391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3716268-virginprune,3,"some good insights, but there are quite a few factual and methodological errors - best for ""mathphobes"" who want to get a better grip on how to intelligently pick through the barrage of pseudo-fact that is thrusted on us by media, politicos, professionals, anyone with an agenda and a number on the tip of their tongue.
