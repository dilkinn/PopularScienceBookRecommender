You know it was going to be sad, how could a man dying of lung cancer before the age of forty be anything but."" Yet to just classify this memoir, to classify this novel as such is to devalue the man he was. He was a lover of literature, a neurosurgeon, a scientist, a son and brother, a husband and father. He tried to live each day to the best of his ability, he helped many and he acknowledged the doctor patient relationship had a big disconnect with the reality of life, how their lives would change after being diagnosed with a serious illness. He was not a saint, he cried when given a death sentence, but his thoughts were not always for him, he always wanted to make sure his wife had a life after he was gone. So in many ways this was a profoundly beautiful read by a remarkable man. His wife says it best, ""What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy."""

It feels awful to give a three star rating to a nice guy (by all accounts) who is now dead. But I simply did not find this book compelling or insightful enough. It is mildly interesting to learn about neurosurgery as a specialty and to read the author's thoughts as he faced diagnosis, illness and then death. I always felt that the author was holding back; that it was too clinical, too calm, just not passionate enough. The first time I felt that I was reading something worthwhile was in the 26 page epilogue by the author's wife. I guess the best way to say it is this; this is a quick read. And of course it should not be. "

I think you should read this book because that talented, inspiring man has incredibly important things to say derived from his own experiences, and it's important to listen and learn from them. Read this book with the knowledge that you might not always be able to understand everything someone goes through, but you can set aside the time to listen to their story and hopefully give them the dignity and respect they deserve as a human being, in life or death. “Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” -Paul Kalanithi"

I just don’t feel comfortable rating someone’s life.Cancer and the death of a close one is something most of us unfortunately can relate to and I think it’s why this book got so popular.I’m glad the author was able to write this book since it was his dream but in my opinion the best part of it was the epilogue from his wife. I’m sure it’s where most of us ended up ugly crying. "

7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"1/12/16: Update: Just wanted to mention that this book goes on sale today. Its an amazing story!Paul Kalanithi studied literature at Stanford University. For his thesis, he studied the work of Walt Whitman, a poet , who a century before, was possessed by the same questions that haunted him. Kalanithi wanted to find a way to understand and describe what he termed ""the Physiological-Spiritual Man."" Kalanithi had a passion for literature. He began to see language as an almost supernatural force, existing between people, bringing our brains, shielded in centimeter-thick skulls, into communion. ""There must be a way, I thought, that the language of life as experienced – – of passion, hunger, of love – – bore some relationship, however convoluted, to the language of neurons, digestive tracks, and heartbeats.""Paul Kalanithi's thesis was well-received -- but neuroscience as literary criticism didn't quite fit in the English Department. ( nor did he). There was a question he couldn't let go of. ""Where did Biology, morality, literature, and philosophy intersect?"".Kalanithi consulted a premed advisor - set aside his passion for literature - and figured out the logistics to get ready for medical school. He was still searching for answers to the question ""what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay?""When he was in his fourth year medical school, he watched many classmates choose to specialize in less demanding areas, (radiology or dermatology for example). It puzzled him that many students focused on lifestyle specialities--those with more humane hours, higher salaries, and lower pressures. For himself, he chose neurosurgery as a specialty. Kalanithi was diagnosed with Cancer. ( he actually was almost certain he had cancer many months before getting an X-Ray or MRI). Once it was clear that the cancer had invaded multiple organ systems--( ""severe illness wasn' life altering--it was life shattering""), decisions needed to be made. His wife Lucy, father, siblings, doctors were all involved - and chemo would start soon. Clarifying the rest of his life ( only age 36 at the time), was going to be a process. He and Lucy went to visit a sperm bank to preserve gametes and options. They had planned on having kids at the end of his residency. To think. Paul Kalanithi wrote this book - relentlessly- fueled with purpose during the last year of his life -- never got to finish his life's plan..( yet he still worked that last year).... But he was racing against time. With this book - he was hoping to confront death - examine it- accept it-- as a physician and a patient. He wanted to help other people understand death and face their mortality. ""It's not exotic..but tragic enough and imaginable enough he says"". There is a beautiful - but so sad- Epilogue by Lucy - from Paul's wife at the end of the book. Their baby had been born eight months before Paul died - March 9th, 2015. Lucy reports that Paul let himself be vulnerable and comforted by family and friends.. and even when terminally ill, he remained fully alive! Thank You Random House, Netgalley, and Paul ( and Lucy), Kalanithi"
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,5,"I read this almost two months ago and realized I never reviewed it. When I finished the book, I just couldn't review it. It's a small book, but it's powerful. I didn't shed any tears at the end of it, but I remember sitting there physically shaking and feeling really numb and tingly. A book has never impacted me that way before, and I'm not even sure why I read the book in the first place since I knew what I was getting myself into. Wait, I know why I wanted to read it. It was very therapeutic for me. I don't want to pull back the curtain too far on my life, but I've seen the havoc cancer causes out of nowhere in people's lives. People very close to me. I've held my grandmother's hand as she took her last breath after battling pancreatic cancer. My grandfather wasn't far behind her thanks to cancer in his lungs and throat. My dad has been battling colon cancer for the last two years. He's up and down. I think chemo does more bad than good. It's definitely taken its toll on him, but he's fighting. All this cancer and death hitting so close to home left me in this weird phase two years ago where I got to learn what a panic attack feels like. It's like having a heart attack, but not really, but close. It's scary. I think cancer blasting through my family while I was in the process of trying to move across the country just really shook me up. I still deal with the effects of it sometimes. I think God was just trying to show me there are some things in life I can't control. I can pick my job, my house, what to watch on Netflix, but I have no power over death or cancer or a heart attack or a car crash or any of it. YeahSo this book was helpful. I felt like I really connected with it and it was something I needed to read. You might not have quite the same reaction, but I still highly recommend reading it. Fiction is always great to escape the dark realities of the world we live in, but sometimes confronting those realities head on is extremely beneficial."

Torschlusspanik [1] sets in and he has to write that one book he always wanted to write. It's partially an autobiography of his training, a hymn to his wife, and a bit on patient-doctor relationship.Sometimes it's way too pretentious for its own good, lots of classical lit, lots of poetry quotes, lots of namedropping - who on earth reads Wittgenstein to a newborn?? - and sometimes it's too sentimental and just straight-up walks into Tuesdays with Morrie territory. It is not an ugly death - for that the family is too well-trained in medicine to ""fight"" ultimately senseless fights, too well-acquainted with death to cause a fuss, too rich to die in a dump, too well-connected to suffer bad doctors.The last chapter written by the wife after his death is probably the best - still, I wouldn't recommend it, not much new, not that interesting [2]. Would make a good book for Oprah's Book Club.I can guarantee you that yours and my death will be much worse than what is described here. Here there is no constant vomiting, no blood, no mucus, no week-long screaming from the pain. Death is too clean, like the book itself.[1] One of the best words we have in German - literally ""gate closing panic"", it usually denotes a woman who starts to behave unusual once she realises that her child-bearing age window is closing, but it can be used to describe everyone who starts to behave unusual once time starts to run out[2] It feels extremely mean to write that about a guy's work who has just died"
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9479701-joseph,3,"Okay, I so wanted to like this very absorbing book more than I did. I am not going to recap it other than to say that Paul came from a privileged background, a very supportive family and an Indian (Asian Tiger) mom. He succumbed to an aggressive form of lung cancer. My own wife died of lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Outside of the hospital I was her caregiver for a year and a half. I was the one who made sure she had oxygen, got to her appointments, watched this once vital woman deteriorate, and held her hand in icu when she passed. Unlike Paul and Lucy, we did not stay together out of a sense of obligation because one of us was sick. Unlike Paul and Lucy we did not have an extended family to support us. Unlike Paul and Lucy we adopted. I went through this with her because I loved her. I never thought of another option even though she tried to persuade me once or twice that there might be other options. The book is very well written and Paul had a gift for including just the right amount of medical detail and jargon. He explains things precisely when explication as needed. The book flows smoothly from his childhood through Stanford and then Yale medical school. Paul according to himself is just about the best at whatever he undertakes and again according to himself he always takes care to score one more point than his closest competitor. He catalogues a list of the books he has read -- exclusively Western -- and drops a few favorite quotations from some. Strangely he makes no mention of Indian writing or writers or of the great Kiowa author Scott Momaday who matriculated at Stanford. Kinda too bad Paul did not read Momaday. If he had he might have understood the power and use of words better than he did.He becomes according to himself a wonderful neurosurgeon, probably the best ever although he does not reduce it to that exact description. He is decisive, fast, innovative and just an all around wonderful doctor.If you are getting the impression that he comes across as extremely self centered you broke the code. If you are getting the impression that he comes across as lacking real depth you not only broke the code you read between the lines.The book is very well written and at times absorbing, but it left me wondering, was that all there was to Paul and Lucy?"

12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15701318-sid,5," ""ALL ORDERS TEND TOWARDS ENTROPY"" This is the story of the perception and management of life and death (both separately and together) of a 36 year old doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgery training when he got diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer. Being a person on the path of being a surgeon, having a love for books, philosophy, literature, writing and a thirst to know deeper meaning for life, I felt I could understand the author very well, somehow! The parts regarding a surgeon's hectic schedule, the heavy burden of patients' wellness and care and the thorough explanation of surgical procedures proved to be like my own normal routine and consequently made me feel more at home with this man's philosophies and researches for whatever he was looking for out there in this whole wide universe!Paul had a passion to fully grab the meaning and purpose of life, death and human existence and this love took him on an adventurous journey first through literature, then through medicine and finally both!“Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.” He found that no matter how much close to a patient a doctor was during his illness, he could never grasp the true meaning of his suffering since he could never be in his shoes!This book shows how fragile life is to spoil the long hours of hard work and fail you in achieving your goals, how unpredictable it can be to divert you from the path that so definitely was leading you towards your dreams just in the previous moment.This book shows how life is to be lived, how death is to be welcomed and how much effort it takes to have the integrity to look them both in the eye, fight with dignity and come out a winner, despite losing your breaths in the battle! Tears welled up in my eyes while reading the part when despite having a weakening body, this man invested enough energy to gain unlimited happiness during the moments of delivery of his daughter. He taught us that vulnerability is not weakness. It takes real strength to reveal your vulnerable side. It is in the weakest moments that a man can be the strongest, never knowing he could endure all that pain.This book opens our eyes to our mortality. That our time in this universe is limited. That love and knowledge are immortal tools that we can use to our aid to make our stay on this planet infinite.Finally this book teaches us how the pain and suffering could be reduced by the undying love, affection and care of one's family. That life is not lived in years. Even in the smallest amount of time, we can create valuable and immortal memories.“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” The book is written in simple and honest language yet it touches the deepest parts of heart and mind. Being written by a man who had a limited time frame and a vast knowledge and understanding of the human miseries and their connections with the beginning, mid and end of the story called life, I would not like to judge it harshly. Just having the courage enough to write a book with such influence on readers is a feat worth praising!The sadness I felt, after knowing that we have lost one of the best neurosurgeons and a visionary, affectionate human being who could do so much with his talent and compassion to reduce the sufferings of the world, was immense!""Only 0.0012% of 36-year-olds get lung cancer. ""The dilemma???He had to be the one!5 starts!Highly recommended!"

15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"Paul Kalanithi is thirty six and so close to finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he finds out he has stage IV lung cancer. As an undergraduate Kalanithi studied English literature and his love of reading and writing had been a constant through out his life. He had always felt that when he was older he would like to write and had decided to focus on neurosurgery for now, where he could make a bigger difference by saving people's lives. All his hopes and dreams for the future were suddenly unrealistic as an upper limit of a handful of years was put onto his life. Kalanithi pens this memoir, dealing with the struggles of facing death and having to go from being able to save others lives to now be the one staring down mortality. The writing was excellent but reading this memoir was so depressing. Just the fact that someone so brilliant was going to die and not be able to keep contributing when they clearly had so much to offer. I was disappointed by where the book left off but then I read the afterword to find out that he had died before he could even finish the memoir which just made it twenty times worse. Death is inevitable but like Kalanithi acknowledges we don't really think about it as being imminent and so it's not the same as when you're terminal and trying to make peace with dying. I just found it so hard to read him struggling to make sense of how to best use the rest of his time especially since there was no way for him to know how limited it really was. Also the fact that he didn't get to see more of his daughter and watch her grow up. It was just depressing honestly, well written but I just felt sad and I don't know what else to say. It just feels unfair because I wish I was even a fraction as smart or eloquent but I'm not but I get to live and he doesnt."

I had to wait a little bit to pull myself together before writing a review of this exquisite book, even though I am tremendously late to the party on this one.""...See what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone, by your words. In a world of asynchronous communication, where we are so often buried in our screens, our gaze rooted to the rectangular objects buzzing in our hands, our attention consumed by ephemera, stop and experience this dialogue with my young departed colleague, now ageless and extant in memory. Listen to Paul.""Paul Kalanithi was, by all accounts, an excellent neurosurgeon, with the potential of being a true guiding force in medicine and science. He spent most of his early adult life seeking knowledge on multiple fronts, from literature and science to philosophy and ethics. When he finally decided to pursue a career in neurology, he wasn't just content to be a doctor—he wanted to understand and identify with his patients fully, to help them and their families adjust to whatever their new reality would be following a diagnosis, an accident, a surgery.""I was pursuing medicine to bear witness to the twinned mysteries of death, its experiential and biological manifestations: at once deeply personal and utterly impersonal.""At the age of 36, Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer. Suddenly his life has transformed him from doctor to patient, not an easy transition for anyone, especially someone as hands-on with patient care as Paul had been. While he and his internist wife Lucy are prepared for the worst, Paul's oncologist has hope, and doesn't allow him to wallow in his diagnosis. If he wants to stop being a neurologist, she tells him, it has to be because he doesn't want to continue or wants to pursue something else—his cancer won't stop him.As he struggles with thoughts of his future, however long that might be, he ponders how to fill that time. Should he continue working in a field that has so richly given back to him, and given him the chance to touch so many lives? What gives a life value, and how can that value be measured? What obligations does he owe his family, his friends, his wife, his infant daughter?""At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.""
When Breath Becomes Air
 is an intellectual and deeply emotional memoir, written by a young man with so much promise, so much heart, so much empathy. It is both a reflection on coming face-to-face with one's own mortality and a commentary on the responsibility doctors have to help their patients and their families through that same reflection, whether it happens with some warning or suddenly. It is also a love story, of a man and his wife, a man and the child he will never truly know, and a man and his career.You know from the very start of Abraham Verghese's introduction to the book that Paul lost his battle with cancer, yet the end of his life, and the epilogue written by Paul's wife still feel like sucker punches. You mourn a man you probably never knew, but you feel truly blessed he chose as one of his final acts to share his life, his death, and his thoughts with the world, because we are all better for them.""'The thing about lung cancer is that it's not exotic,' Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. 'It's just tragic enough and just imaginable enough. [The reader] can get into these shoes, walk a bit and say, 'So that's what it looks like from here...sooner or later I'll be back here in my own shoes.' That's what I'm aiming for, I think. Not the sensationalism of dying, and not exhortations to gather rosebuds, but: Here's what lies up ahead on the road.' Of course, he did more than just describe the terrain. He traversed it bravely.""This is a beautiful book, truly a work of art that I won't soon forget. Easily one of the finest books I've read in some time. My thanks to the Kalanithi family, and Paul himself, for this opportunity to view such an exceptional man at such a critical juncture in his life.

(Abraham Verghese)And we, for the most part, can actually say the same thing about Paul Kalanithi. We've come to know of him only after he had left this world of ours. Ironically, I write this on March 9th, the one-year anniversary of his passing.Paul Kalanithi: son, husband, father, brilliant surgeon. He was a healer whose very existence gave hope to so many. How can this be? In my humble opinion, I believe that we are here on this earth for the appointed time of our being. We draw no more breath than what is pre-determined by a Higher Being....be it the last, raspy breaths of the elderly or the sole breath of a dying newborn. Paul was here for his personal alloted time.This book is divided into two sections: before cancer diagnosis and after cancer diagnosis. Many have expressed a disconnect after having read this story. Many were looking for the gentle words of the dying in philosophical terms. The little nuggets were indeed there. But the perspective was all Paul's.The beginning of the book was both clinical and procedural. That was Paul revealing his sense of ""being""......what it took to become this focused man of medicine and of science. His steps were measured in the direction of his accomplishments and towards the light of a future that was never meant to be.The second part of the book concentrated on the shifting of his identity from directing physician to the role of dependent patient. His profound knowledge of medicine served him in a limited capacity as he fought against the aggression of the disease. ""But I'd had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle."" Much like the rest of us in our stilted human experience.The Epilogue is beautifully written by his wife, Lucy. She writes: ""his transformation, from life to death, the ultimate transformation that awaits us all.""When Breath Becomes Air should not be taken as a maudlin reading, but one of hope and one of living a life well, no matter what the promise of longevity reveals."

19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8836060-michelle,5,"“When Breath Becomes Air” is not only poignant, touching, and painful -- it is also full of love, insight, courage and humility. I’m thankful Paul Kalanithi found a way to share his love of writing and prodigious talents with the world, especially under such harrowing circumstances. The world is a richer place because of it… And at heart, this is a life-affirming book. It was for me, anyway.Paul expresses, lived, and has shared how meaning can transform tragedy into a deep transcendence of being that shimmers. With meaning and eloquence, he was able to step outside of himself, trapped in his disease for sustained periods of time, and create the side of humanity we can't know. He does so with balance and personal reflection on the value of life and our relationships with others. His realization of patients as people, and about quality of life was profound to me. Though sad, the story never felt manipulative or self-pitying. I couldn’t help but reflect on my life while I was reading this, and I think this is the book's greatest strength. From a distance, it might seem that Paul’s life would be hard to relate to -- Stanford, Yale, Christian dad, Hindu mom, neurosurgery etc.-- but his empathy and insight cut through all that and make him all the more human. This is a memoir that anyone ""ceaselessly striving"" to live with grace, dignity, and accountability will benefit from -- a testimony of the impact of such a life. Paul’ s life-long love and study of literature is evident in the way he uses words to express his thoughts and concepts. His lyricism is in the choice of his words, making it for a very direct, honest, objective narration, yet deep and captivating. As I see his message: we will die, but we can live a meaningful life by giving ourselves to make an impact on others -- by trying to improve those around us by doing good deeds, and by art such as writing. In this way, we may live on, as Paul has managed through this sublime memoir. I found his wife's epilogue particularly touching in describing the last couple of weeks when he could write no more, and his monumental endeavor to write his story. Thinking back as I write this review, I felt the loss of this man. Just like in my own life, there was an impact that required a little time before I could look back and see the gifts of wisdom shared from a unique human being: “With what strife and pains we come into the world we know not, but ’tis commonly no easy matter to get out of it.” "
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,4,"A very high 4 stars. When Breath Becomes Air is so good and so sad. It's a brief memoir of a life ended way too early. Kalanithi was 35 years old and finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer. As he was living out the end of his life, he wrote this brief powerful memoir. In the first section, he describes how he became aware of his diagnosis -- he essentially self diagnosed. In the second section he explains how he decided to become a neurosurgeon -- he wavered between being a writer and a doctor but decided that he wanted to do something tangible that engaged him in the real world -- although he had planned to become a writer later in life. In the third section, he writes about being a patient, his struggle to live a normal life, becoming a father, and his failing health. And the final section is written by his wife after his death – she writes about his death, how he wrote the book and who he was to her. I'm not sure what to say to do justice to this book and to Kalanithi. There's a bit of a stream of consciousness feel to the book. But all the bits and pieces of narrative add up to a very meaningful whole: he writes strong fluid prose, he has a brilliant mind, he conveys his dual love of literature and science, and he has great human insight into life, medicine, dying and death. It makes for a very sad book -- not because Kalanithi is melodramatic or self-pitying – quite the contrary -- but because as I read and savoured his prose and thoughts I couldn't help feeling the sense of a life cut far too short. I can't fathom how he was able to so soberly write this book in the last few months of his life, but I'm grateful I had a chance to read it. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for an opportunity to read an advance copy. "

But the numbness reappears the instant I allow the pages to unfold in my memory. The silence which suddenly parts to let these memories seep in and cloud my vision, fills the air. Even as I grapple to make ‘sense’ of what it means to lose a dear, dear one, I, ironically, already know that very ‘sense’ to be ephemeral. No part of my being accepts death; they all adjust the lens to view it as a part of life.Paul was a neurosurgeon by profession, and passion, at Stanford University School of Medicine. Standing at the threshold of seeing his dream come true, one built on a decade and half of relentless academic pursuits and tireless hours at residency, he witnesses a cruel twist of destiny; he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, just months before his scheduled graduation. A doctor in mind and a fighter in spirit, he battles this uninvited and lethal intruder with immense mettle and equanimity, gaining much wisdom during the course and eventually, surrendering to its inevitability and in a strange, serene way, to its affability.Paul Kalanithi’s memoir is a sublime read. It is a reminder of the transience of life yet an even louder reminder of longevity of deeds and memories. That in little manifestations and significant decisions, in careless words and sombre confessions, we continue to live, long after we are gone. He wrote most parts of this book during his last months in debilitating pain and treatment but he couldn’t have sounded more balanced and calm. The impact of this book is not in his sage-like, detached, professional treatment of his grave illness but in its earnestness; earnestness to detect vulnerabilities and find a path through them that eventually stands meaningful. Somewhere around page 161, he talks about the much quoted five stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And along with them, his case, with aberration, wherein the cycle was embraced in reverse order by him. From accepting his fate to slipping into depression at not being able to pursue his career, to adamantly cherry-picking duties at hospital, if only to be closer to his first love to getting angry at his lost mobility and scarred vitality, to finally, plunging into his surgeon duties with a vengeance, agonizingly shoving his deteriorating body aside, Paul exhibits an incredibly hungry mind and dedicated soul. As a reader, I have, many times, felt the palliative effect of books. During my times of distress, I have seen my sorrows and melancholy unloading on the sturdy and wise shoulders of authors and their verses. Thus, I could fathom the strength Paul drew from Beckett and Eliot, Forster and Nietzsche. And most importantly, from his wife, Lucy. A doctor herself, how crushing it would have been for her to keep a good head and not forsake the glimmer of hope in the light of her professional inferences. But as Mark Twain says, “The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”Paul and Lucy Kalanithi did live, in their lovely daughter, Cady. Born sixteen months post Paul’s diagnosis, she had the physical company of her father for eight months only. But she will continue to know his courage and feel his magic every time she will pick this book up. "

At the same time, he realized neurosurgery brings him joy—and so does his family, who have supported him from the start, especially his wife. He mentioned at the beginning of the book that cancer may have just saved his marriage, and while that seems crazy, it is also incredibly true in his case.Paul brings us back to his adolescence and college years to make us see why he changed his path so drastically—from studying the written word to studying dead bodies. I was fascinated as he explained his fascination with ''what makes life meaningful, even in the face of death.''Ironically enough, for a long time he wanted to somewhat decipher death, and be able to witness it firsthand—which he did, and yet his illness allowed him to comprehend and think about life like he never did before. Not only is this insightful, honest, important, touching and beautiful, it’s also educational. I feel as though I understand my place in the world better than I did yesterday. And I have a newfound respect for doctors and medicine. Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin’"

Facing an impending loss without a foundation of faith to fall back on, I find myself asking, “What is the meaning of life if we’re all just going to die?”Paul Kalanithi answers that question in the most meaningful way possible in his outstanding book. A 36-year- old neurosurgeon, Paul wrestled between medicine and literature as an eventual career. Medicine won out and he was just on the cusp of a stellar trajectory when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Paul nurtured a passionate belief in the moral dimensions of his job. He also strongly believed that the relational aspect between people undergirded meaning and that life’s meaning has everything to do with the depth of the relationships we form in our journey. He says this, “The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win …You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which are ceaselessly striving.Just as his surgeon’s scalpel eased disease of the brain and saved lives, his words give reasons for living. The grace with which he navigates his journey – from a top-rated surgical resident to writer to his most important role of all, husband and father of a young daughter – his book is ample testimony to how one life well-lived can continue to create such a great impact.In the foreword by fellow doctor and writer Abraham Verghese, that doctor writes, “He (Paul) wasn’t writing about anything—he was writing about time and what it meant to him now, in the context of his illness.” And in the afterword by his wife Lucy, the meaning of that time becomes even clearer. I felt the sense of having lost a personal friend.Let me make this clear if I haven’t already: this is NOT a self-pitying, manipulative memoir and it is not the reason I’m 5-starring it. It’s a beautifully written, insightful, page-turning book on how we connect as humans and why life – no matter how truncated – is worth living. I will be recommending this strongly to just about everyone in my life."

Even though the book is incredibly sad, it is ultimately life affirming and worth the emotional investment.At the age of thirty-six, Paul Kalanthi, a doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgeon training, is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. This revelation becomes a dividing line in his life, something of a reversal of fortune. Paul goes from being a healthy physician with limitless possibility ahead of him to a sick patient with an uncertain future.Paul's love affair with literature began at an early age. ""Books became my closest confidants, finely ground lenses providing new views of the world."" Fearing that her son would not receive an adequate education in the small Arizona town where his father opened a cardiology practice, Paul's mother supplemented with endless literary classics. Paul, convinced that he would not go into medicine, decides to major in English literature but also completes a degree in human biology because of his fascination with the brain. ""Literature provided a rich account of human meaning; the brain, then, was the machinery that somehow enabled it."" After completing a Master's degree in English literature and wanting to discover where biology, morality, literature, and philosophy intersect, Paul chooses to apply to medical school. ""Words began to feel as weightless as the breath that carried them."" He longed for a direct experience. He selects neurosurgery because for him it was truly a calling.After the cancer diagnosis, Paul struggles with answering the philosophical questions that plague him. ""The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later you may feel differently...Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process."" Paul never claims to have the answers, but he perseveres and continues to live. Paul and his wife Lucy even decide to have a baby together. He goes back to the OR until he is no longer able to practice and then dedicates himself to writing this book. Unfortunately, Paul lost his battle in March of 2015, two years after his diagnosis. I am sure different people take different things from this book, but I was captivated by Paul's love of literature. He even credited literature for bringing him back to life during his first course of treatment. Paul's words are so eloquent, and frankly, I had to restrain myself not to quote the entire book. After learning of the cancer, Paul joked with a friend, ""The good news is I've already outlived two Brontës, Keats, and Stephen Crane. The bad news is that I haven't written anything."" Well, Paul Kalanthi did leave behind a powerful work of literature that I highly recommend.Indulge me for one final quote:In the end, it cannot be doubted that each of us can see only a part of the picture. Human knowledge is never contained in one person...It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete. And truth comes somewhere above all of them."

In the second part, we are invited into a time of his life that is heartbreaking, tragic, filled with bewilderment and pain. It also overflows with wisdom and Dr. Kalanithi’s moving quest for meaning; a quest he began at an early age and one that guided him throughout his life.A neurosurgeon and neuroscientist who won awards and whose work was sought after by many institutions as well as individuals, Dr. Kalanithi chose a path that was both intensely specialized and emotionally draining. Or, to be more precise, this path chose him; for Dr. Kalanithi, it was a calling.Brutally long hours requiring a sharp focus where a millimeter can separate life from death, triumph from tragedy instilled in me a completely renewed view of what is required as a surgeon. I cannot even imagine the degree of energy and inner resources that would be required to accomplish the work he did.Reading about his passage into and through the world of medicine and about the extent of what he called his ‘moral responsibility’ to each patient was enlightening. How he learned to become more than just a surgical machine, to become directly involved in his patient’s pre-surgery care as well as after-surgery care is inspiring and, in a sense, an instruction booklet for developing integrity and humility.The second part of the book takes us on a journey where we share in his battle with cancer. He was diagnosed with metastatic Stage IV lung cancer in May 2013, and he died in March 2015, less than a month away from his 38th birthday. His last wish was for his wife to ensure that his book was published, and so it was in January 2016.This journey we embark on with Dr. Kalanithi is an epic journey, and although I finished reading this book last night, the impact of all that I read kept me awake into the small hours of the morning. I feel as though I had experienced the entire range of human emotion while reading this novel, and I learned so much about both the frailty of human life and its heroic strength.This is a book that, even more than usual, will be experienced differently by each person. There are many nuggets of wisdom in it, and as with all wisdom, it comes to each of us only in the proportion that we are ready to receive it. It is what makes this novel such an important book – one that I highly recommend to everyone."

It is a memoir about his life and illness, battling stage IV metastatic lung cancer. It was published on January 12, 2016. At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naive medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهاردهم ماه ژوئن سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: آن هنگام که نفس هوا می‌شود؛ نویسنده: پل کالانیتی؛ مترجم شکیبا محب‌علی؛ تهران؛ انتشارات کوله‌پشتی؛ 1395؛ در 199ص؛ شابک 9786008211228؛ موضوع ریه ها - سرطان - جراحان مغز و اعصاب - ایالات متحده - سرگذشتنامه - زن و شوهر - سده 20معنوان: آخرین نفس؛ نویسنده پل کالانیتی؛ مترجم: مهرداد بازیاری؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس، ‏‫‬‏1395؛ در 193ص؛ شابک: 9786001822223؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛عنوان: وقتی نفس هوا میشود؛ نویسنده: ‌پال کلانثی؛ مترجم: ساناز کریمی؛ تهران: انتشارات میلکان‏‫، 1395؛ در 159ص؛ شابک 9786007845998؛ چاپ سوم 1396؛عنوان: وقتی نفس هوا می‌شود؛ نویسنده پال کلانیتی؛ پیشگفتار از آبراهام ورگس؛ مترجم: سمیرا صادقی‌چیمه؛ ویراستار موسسه ویراستاران؛ تهران: همگامان چاپ‏‫‫، 1398؛ در 221ص؛ شابک 9789647666442؛عنوان: هنگامی که نفس هوا می‌شود؛ نویسنده: پل کلانیتی؛ مترجم احیا عمل‌صالح؛ ‏‫ویراستار امیر طاهری؛ شیراز بازتاب فرهنگ، ‏‫1398؛ در 176ص؛ شابک 9786226768016؛عنوان: ‏‫وقتی نفس هوا می‌شود‮‬‏‫؛ نویسنده: پل کالانیتی‮‬‏‫؛ مترجم: علی‌اكبر صالحی؛ تهران: فرهنگ و دانش‏‫، 1395؛ در 264ص؛ شابک 9786008065111؛نقل از متن ترجمه ی جناب مهرداد بازیاری: من و «لوسی» روی تخت بیمارستان، کنار هم دراز کشیده بودیم، و گریه می‌کردیم. سی‌.اتی. اسکن همچنان روی صفحه ی رایانه می‌درخشید، و در این مورد خاص، دیگر هویت من، به‌ عنوان یک پزشک، مطرح نبود. با سرطانی که به چندین عضو بدنم حمله کرده بود، تشخیص واضح بود. اتاق غرق سکوت بود؛ «لوسی» گفت که دوستم دارد. به «لوسی» گفتم، نمی‌خواهم بمیرم؛ گفتم: پس از من ازدواج کند، چون نمی‌توانم تحمل کنم، که او تنها بماند. گفتم: باید هرچه سریع‌تر مسائل مالی، و وام‌هایمان را روبراه کنیم. بعد با اعضای خانواده تماس گرفتیم. کمی بعد «ویکتوریا» به اتاقم سر زد، و در مورد اسکن و معالجات آینده، حرف زدیم. وقتی موضوع تدارک بازگشت من به گروه رزیدنتی را به میان کشید، حرفش را قطع کردم، و گفتم: «ویکتوریا»، دیگه هیچ‌وقت به‌ عنوان دکتر به این بیمارستان برنمی‌گردم؛ موافق نیستی؟ ظاهراً فصل دیگری از زندگی من، به پایان رسیده بودشاید کل کتاب زندگیم، در حال بسته شدن بود. به‌ جای بودن در نقش یک شبان، برای حمایت از تغییر و تحولات حیات آدم‌ها، خودم را، در نقش یک گوسفند گیج و سردرگم، می‌دیدم. بیماری‌های سخت و طاقت فرسا، تغییر دهنده ی زندگی نیستند، بلکه متلاشی کننده ی زندگی اند؛ کمی شبیه ظهور عیسی، و مثل تأثیر انفجار نور است. این نوع بیماری‌ها، همه‌ ی چیزهای واقعاً مهم را، از بین می‌برد، و بیشتر مثل این است، که یک نفر، همین الان، یک بمب آتشزا، در مسیر پیش رو، انداخته باشد. و حالا مجبور بودم، در اطراف و درون آن آتش، کار و زندگی کنم. برادرم «جیوان»، به بالینم آمد، و گفت: تو کارای زیادی انجام دادی، و به درجات والایی رسیدی. خودتم می‌دونی. مگه نه؟ آه کشیدم. منظور بدی نداشت، اما کلماتش پوچ، و بی‌معنی به نظر می‌رسید. زندگی من، بر روی استعداد نهانی، و عوامل بالقوه، بنا شده بود. بدون این‌که کشف و فهمیده شود. برنامه‌ های زیادی برای انجام داشتم، و تا یک قدمی اهدافم رسیده بودم. از لحاظ جسمی ناتوان بودم، و تصوراتم در مورد آینده، و هویت شخصیم، مضمحل شده بود، و با همان سرگردانی موجودیتی روبرو بودم، که بیمارانم بودندسرطان ریه ی من، محرز بود. دیگر آینده‌ ای برنامه ریزی شده، و تلاش‌های سرسختانه، برای دستیابی اهداف، وجود نداشت؛ از طریق شغلم، کاملاً با مرگ‌ آشنا بودم، و اکنون مرگ، به دیدار خودم آمده بود. بالاخره با من، چهره به چهره می‌شد، و با این وجود، به ظاهر همچنان قابل شناسایی نبود. ایستاده بر سر دو راهی، در جاییکه می‌توانستم رد پای بیماران بی‌شماری را ببینم، که طی سال‌ها معالجه کرده بودم؛ اما به‌ جای آن، یک صحرای سفید تهی و متروک، زیر یک نور ضعیف می‌دیدم؛ انگار که طوفان شن، همه ی آثار‌ آشنا را، از بین برده بود. خورشید در حال غروب بود. صبح روز بعد، ترخیص می‌شدم. یک وقت از متخصص غدد، برای آخر هفته، گرفته شده بود، اما پرستار گفت که متخصص غدد؛ آنشب و قبل از این‌که دنبال بچه‌ هایش برود؛ به من سر می‌زند؛ اسمش «اما هیوارد» بود، و می‌خواست قبل از نخستین قرار رسمی‌مان، مرا ببیند؛ زیاد «اما» را نمی‌شناختم ــ قبلاً چند تن از بیمارانش را معالجه کرده بودم ــ ولی غیر از عبور محترمانه از کنار هم، با هم حرف نزده بودیم؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 25/03/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

I first read this book a year and a half ago; when I picked it back up recently, I thought I’d give it just a quick skim to remind myself why I loved it. Before I knew it I’d read 50 pages, and I finished it the next night in the car on the way back from a family party, clutching my dinky phone as a flashlight, awash in tears once again. (To put this in perspective: I almost never reread books. My last rereading was of several Dickens novels for my master’s in 2005–6.)What struck me most on my second reading is how Kalanithi, even in his brief life, saw both sides of the medical experience. He was the harried neurosurgery resident making life and death decisions and marveling at the workings of the brain; in a trice he was the patient with terminal lung cancer wondering how to make the most of his remaining time with his family.Yet in both roles his question was always “What makes human life meaningful?” – a quest that kept him shuttling between science, literature and religion. In eloquent prose and with frequent scriptural allusions, this short, technically unfinished book narrates Kalanithi’s past (his growing-up years and medical training), present (undergoing cancer treatment but ultimately facing death) and future (the legacy he leaves behind, including his daughter).Looking back once again at the guidelines for the Wellcome Book Prize (“At some point, medicine touches all our lives. Books that find stories in those brushes with medicine are ones that add new meaning to what it means to be human”), When Breath Becomes Air stands out as a perfect exemplar.My original review from October 2015:I’m something of an aficionado of cancer memoirs, a subgenre that appeals for family history reasons but also because I appreciate stories lived right on the knife edge of life and death. Here’s one I would recommend to anyone for the beauty of its prose – a fine blend of literature and medicine – and the simple yet wholehearted picture of a life cut short.Paul Kalanithi was 36 and just completing his neurosurgery residency in Stanford, California when he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer that did not respond well to treatment. It came as a complete surprise and set the young surgeon’s life on a new course. He and his coterie of doctors managed his symptoms so he could operate for as long as he could, but when the time came he knew he wanted to devote his last year to writing this memoir. In addition, he would get a brief, sweet taste of fatherhood: he and his wife Lucy, also in the medical field, decided to have a child.Kalanithi grew up the son of Indian immigrants in Arizona. “I was driven less by achievement than by trying to understand, in earnest: What makes human life meaningful?” he recalls. Degrees in English literature and human biology were disparate attempts to find an answer. Like Henry Marsh (Do No Harm), he has a surgeon’s knowledge of the anatomy of reasoning, but realizes that does not provide a full picture. He recognizes the responsibility of holding others’ lives in the balance, and regrets occasional failures of empathy.“Those burdens are what make medicine holy and wholly impossible: in taking up another’s cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.” It’s intriguing to see religious language in that statement – indeed, Kalanithi saw his work as a calling, and one with moral connotations. Christian imagery shows up repeatedly:Instead of being the pastoral figure aiding a life transition, I found myself the sheep, lost and confused.Openness to human relationality does not mean revealing grand truths from the apse; it means meeting patients where they are, in the narthex or nave, and bringing them as far as you can.When’s the last time you encountered the word “narthex”?! The vocabulary is striking throughout, as in another favorite passage: “A tureen of tragedy was best allotted by the spoonful. Only a few patients demanded the whole at once; most needed time to digest.”Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015. There’s a lovely epilogue from his wife – like Marion Coutts, the author of The Iceberg, she’s more than competent to carry on his story."
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,5,"Paul Kalanithi tells us about a 62 year old man with a brain tumor.We strolled into his room on morning rounds and the resident asked him “Mr Michaels, how are you feeling?”“Four six one eight nineteen!” he replied, somewhat affably. The tumor had interrupted his speech circuitry, so he could speak only in streams of numbers, but he still had prosody, he could still emote : smile, scowl, sigh. He recited another series of numbers, this time with urgency. There was something he wanted to tell us, but the digits could communicate nothing other than his fear and fury.“Fourteen one two eight,” he pleaded with me, holding my hand. “Fourteen one two eight.”“I’m sorry.”“Fourteen one two eight,” he said mournfully, staring into my eyes. And then I left to catch up with the team.I have seen another example of this kind of language affliction myself. My own mother had vascular dementia and lost the power of language in her last three or four months. And yet she still conversed with us. So she would speak in streams of jumbled syllables which made no sense at all, but they would sound exactly like normal speech – some streams of gibberish sounded just like amusing anecdotes and questions would have a rising inflection – you could tell when she was recounting a wistful ancient memory. In fact you could tell all the emotions of what she was saying, you just couldn’t understand a single word, because she was no longer speaking in words. I think that in her own mind she was making perfect sense. Whether she could understand what we said to her is anyone’s guess.  Her final infirmity taught me a valuable lesson – not all dementia is cruel. Her version was quite kind. She seemed very contented. She never seemed to notice anything was amiss.  Quite the opposite happened to the author of this remarkable memoir. He was a neurosurgeon, he was in his late 30s, just about to be launched into the very peak of a glittering career. He knew exactly what he was looking at when he saw his own CT scans.  I was going through some books cluttering up my to-read shelf and I picked up this one today; I can’t even remember how it got there. From somebody else I think. Not really my kind of thing – a bit morbid, a bit melodramatic, a bit obvious – but once I started I was hooked all the way to the bitter end. He has a beautiful style.I pulled away the fat until the fascia appeared and I could feel the tips of his vertebrae. I opened the fascia and smoothly dissected the muscle away, until only the wide, glistening vertebrae showed up through the wound, clean and bloodless. There’s quite a lot of that. He is as unembarrassed about his own surgical skill as he is about his own cancer and its terrible progression. Some people, I guess, are just fantastic.I agree with everybody else : 5 stars."

30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"By now I’m sure you’ve all heard about this book by the young Dr. Paul Kalanithi, who, in his mid-30s, was completing his training as a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist when he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. At the time, he and his wife Lucy, also a physician, were contemplating having children. Universities were wooing him. The future was all mapped out, years of hard work about to pay off.And then he got the news about his cancer. Suddenly, he had to reassess his life and think: How do I want to spend the rest of my time, however long that may be?One of his long-term goals was to become a writer. And before he died in March 2015 he asked his wife (and now mother of his child) and parents to make sure this book – alas, incomplete at the time of his death – got published. And this is the result, a brief but powerful and remarkable volume.The book, complete with prologue and (written by Lucy) moving epilogue, is divided into two parts. The first recounts moments from Kalanithi’s childhood, his early love of literature (he studied both literature and biology as an undergrad) and his discovery of his calling as a physician. The second deals with his illness. For the most part, Kalanithi’s writing is clear and earnest, and there are some surprising moments. At one point during his pre-med years at Stanford he was so poor that he squatted for a time in an empty dormitory. He quotes a lot of literature, especially Joyce and Beckett, but I wish he had explored in more depth what he got from books.It feels churlish to critique the writing of such a multi-talented man who never got to finesse the manuscript in book form with an editor, but surely someone at Random House could have made some of these sentences more graceful: How little do doctors understand the hells through which we put patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving. Our relationship was still deep in meaning, a shared and evolving vocabulary about what mattered. If human relationality formed the bedrock of meaning, it seemed to us that rearing children added another dimension to that meaning.I had to look up “asymptote,” and I wish an editor had tweaked that awkward word “relationality.”The second half of the book is much richer, because it’s here that Kalanithi is forced to dig deep and ponder big questions. Here he is questioning his identity:Because I wasn’t working, I didn’t feel like myself, a neurosurgeon, a scientist – a young man, relatively speaking, with a bright future spread before him. Debilitated, at home, I feared I wasn’t much of a husband for Lucy. I had passed from the subject to the direct object of every sentence of my life. In fourteenth-century philosophy, the word patient simply meant “the object of an action,” and I felt like one. As a doctor, I was an agent, a cause; as a patient, I was merely something to which things happened.That last observation is simple yet profound. Witnessing his rapid maturation is inspiring and, in the end, makes you reflect on your own priorities. His final words, about his young daughter, are so wise and generous they'll make you tear up. And Lucy’s bittersweet epilogue puts her husband's writing in perspective. She knows the book feels unfinished, and that it doesn’t capture Kalanithi's sense of humour and other qualities. But sometimes, we can intuit, there’s not time for everything. Let’s be grateful for what we do have, not what we don’t."

Dr. Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgical resident entering his final year of training when he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. This memoir is Paul's story for his daughter, Cady, who was 8 months old when he passed away, just 22 months after his cancer diagnosis. Among other things, Paul writes about his career, his love for his family, his views on the 'doctor and patient relationship' and his eventual transistion from doctor to patient. Something that really stood out for me in the book was when Paul explained that as a doctor, you study and learn all the exact descriptions and details of symptoms and illnesses and diseases, but you don't actually ""know"" what it truly ""feels"" like for the patient until you become one. You spend so much time advising patients about what to expect and how an illness may progress, how treatment may feel or what side effects you may get, but you don't TRULY KNOW how it feels to be in their shoes.The Epilogue, written by Paul's wife, was a very beautiful finish to the book. I shed quite a few tears throughout this book, but that Epilogue had me sobbing. Publishing this book was one of Paul's last requests to his wife and family before he died. How wonderful that Paul's inspiring story gets to live on forever through this beautiful book!"

I'm not sure I even need to acknowledge the brilliance, ambition, tenacity, curiosity, and endurance this man possessed or the fact that he wrote in a way that felt conversational and genuine, even when discussing procedures of the brain and medical school examples well outside most people's normal realm. His wife's epilogue was extremely well-written and reduced me to tears, as did his note to his baby daughter. I felt it was a wonderful gift he gave his wife by tasking her with seeing the book through to publication...giving her the opportunity to speak about him and truly keep his memory alive while really focusing on the most positive aspects of his experiences as a husband, a father, and a neurosurgeon.There is much to be learned here about death and living with a terminal illness, but what I came away with from this clearly unfinished memoir is simple: if there were more doctors endeavoring to make the type of connection to their patients that Paul Kalanithi saw as valuable and worked to establish, the state of medical care in this country would be improved in a way that likely cannot be quantified. This man came to realize the value of human connection. He witnessed the effect it had on a patient's ability to accept their situations and their ability to make decisions. He knew the strength of the doctor/patient relationship and he saw the positive outcome of treating the whole patient rather than focusing on just the medical problem to be solved. He was lucky to have an oncologist with the same vision treating him later in the book. Paul Kalanithi has left a great legacy. I hope his generation of doctors/surgeons/educators is paying attention. 5 stars for this beautiful, gentle soul and this book that could change the future of medicine."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,5,"I found this to be a very thought provoking, resonant, difficult at times, and oh so human memoir. Very relatable for me, especially in parts that might not be so to other readers. Kalanithi was a resident neurosurgeon, neuroscientist, with aspirations to become a writer later in life when he was diagnosed with a virulent lung malignancy that was to end all of his plans and goals. His memoir becomes a thrashing out of his life before and after, a view of what is this life about. What is Life? What is a Good Life? What is a Good Death? What gives life meaning?Kalanithi uses his own life, his family and incidents from his life as student, intern and surgeon to explore these meanings and seems able to answer these questions for himself. The answers are quite often difficult, sometimes beautiful, often so personal that the reader may not always relate to all the details, but the meaning seemed present for me. Family, love, work, doing the best he could do, striving for success--to relieve suffering as his work dealt in diseases and injuries to the brain, the center of personhood. There is much ego here...but I don't believe a neurosurgeon exists without ego--who would dare to enter someone else's brain with a scalpel otherwise. And there is also the mind of a seeker of beauty -- in his infant child, in nature, his wife, the human body.Kalanithi's wife, Lucy, also a physician, has written an excellent Epilogue in which she sums up the ""end of the story"" and also states that Paul would be unlikely to finish the manuscript for the book due to physical changes. I think this shows somewhat in the book but should not hold anyone back from reading it. It is a powerful exploration of one man's life, as it is ending.As his wife wrote in the Epilogue: He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life, and his book explores that essential territory. This struggle apparently began early in his life and took on new urgency with his illness.Highly recommendedA copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

I was waiting for the right time, and that never seemed to come. Timing is important for a read like this, and we all have our connections to books or topics that we feel might contribute to poor timing…If Beth hadn’t had this on her reading list for November and offered a buddy read, I don’t know if I ever would have picked it up. Even though I desperately wanted to read it, I was scared.What happened to Paul Kalanithi could happen to any one of us. A young life full of promise with some uncomfortable symptoms he explained away as stress and body ailments that would come along with one of the most physical and mentally draining times of his life, his last year of residency in neurosurgery.Kalanithi chronicles his early life, the role of his parents in his education, his siblings, his time in college- what he studied and why. He shares many philosophical thinkings he has had and how they contribute to the path he chose. He comes to a fork in the road where he has to choose between being a writer and being a doctor, and he chooses the latter. Why? Not for the fortune and fame because of all the sacrifice it would take to get there; instead, it was a calling for him.Documenting the years of his training, including his residency, and up through his diagnosis to the birth of his daughter, and then his last documented days, I have to say I cried in the beginning, and I cried while reading the last 60 pages. Once Kalanithi knew he was rapidly declining, I could not stop my tears. Then, when his story ends, and his wife, Lucy, completes it, I continued to weep. Paul Kalanithi’s had worked hard to accomplish so many things, and it was all cut devastatingly short. He had a tenderness in his love for his wife, his daughter, his parents and brothers, his friends, but also in how he approached every human he encountered. He never disconnected from the human connection, that each patient was someone’s biggest love.Even though this book ripped me apart, and yes, it made me cry, I’m grateful that I know, and can be inspired by, Paul Kalanithi’s heart.Thank you to Beth for another wonderful buddy read. So far we are two for two with emotional reads!My reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com"
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48024027-janet-gould,2,"I expect the author was actually a much nicer guy than he comes across as being in this book. However throughout the book he tells us again and again that he was the smartest kid in school, that he got into Stanford AND Yale and was the best med student and the best med students become surgeons and the best surgeons become neurosurgeons, so of course he became a neurosurgeon. And then... became the BEST neurosurgeon - chief resident at a top hospital. And wait there's more: he's also well- read and illustrates this by throwing in frequent quotes from literature. It is unfortunate the author spent so much time cataloging his accomplishments when actually he had an interesting story: a young man thought he had most of his life ahead of him and was suddenly faced with a mortal illness. A more introspective story might have explored how this sudden reversal of fortune affected his inner life, relationships, and values. But this is not an introspective story and only touches on such things in a very superficial way. Perhaps the most interesting question here arises from the backstory. Why does a young man when faced with a deadly disease remain narcissistically focussed on his own accomplishments? Is this the price to be paid for an upbringing that reminds us of the ""the Namesake"" and the ""Tiger Mother?""But none of these ideas are explored and unfortunately the book becomes a not very interesting story about a promising career cut short and a too-early death.

“Servere illness wasn’t life altering, it was life shattering. It felt less like an epiphany, a piercing burst of light illuminating what really matters, and more like someone had just firebombed the path forward. Now I would have to work around it.”
Paul Kalanithi is just thirty-six years old when he’s diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before entering the medical field, he debated about whether to follow his love of literature into a teaching and writing field. It’s touching that he got to do both things in his short life, and that his one attempt at authorship would produce this poetic, ethereal ode to a life more than half lived.I’m still processing this book several days after completing it, so excuse my lack of other descriptive words. Books like these make me overwhelmingly sad, so I don’t usually seek them out, but in this case I feel so grateful for having met Paul through his work. Abraham Verghese described coming to know Paul through his prose in the foreword, and I couldn’t have described it any better."

So reading this and putting myself in the shoes of someone having to make those tough decisions and be equipped with all that knowledge was a big treat. This book wasn't quite as hard-hitting, philosophical, and sad as I was expecting it to be, but I'm still glad I read it. I was choked up during the epilogue thinking about his young daughter growing up and reading this for the first time. It must be so special for his family. At the same time, anyone could pick this up and see how resilient and admirable Paul was in the face of death, which is why it was a bestseller and won the Goodreads award. I'm definitely gonna be pondering this for a bit."
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-fabian-councillor,4,"Paul Kalanithi, the author of this touching memoir, died of stage IV lung cancer in March 2015, ten months before the publication of the novel which would not only raise attention to his fate, but also to the general effects of the terrible disease that is cancer (which should never cease to deserve attention; it is a subject too important). When I first opened the pages of this book, what I expected was a clinical description of his disease's course, but Kalanithi surprised me and probably a lot of other people as well.This is a work of reflection. Paul Kalanithi lived for only 37 years, but in the end of his life he was thankful for the experiences he had and the life he was allowed to live, for the woman he married and the career he focused many parts of his life on. His reflections on the illness are touching and moving, but his book is also about his thoughts on doctoring, included many interesting aspects about his time-consuming steps to become a respected doctor and to establish his career as a neurosurgeon. Survived by his wife (who wrote the beautiful afterword to this book) and a daughter, Kalanithi talks about the struggle of first being a doctor treating patients and then, from one day to the next, turning into a patient being treated by doctors. After all, facing mortality is a difficult thing to do for everyone who had to deal with death at a certain point of their lives. And so was it for Kalanithi.I bear a lot of respect for Kalanithi and was incredibly touched by his fate. His prose was not always as natural and flowing as you might wish in a book, but he delivered the best he could, and I am the last person to criticize him for that - especially considering the circumstances under which he wrote these pages. Even more, the book was not as depressing as you might expect in a memoir about cancer.

“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”

Paul Kalanithi's words inspired me, his story touched me, and I am grateful for the publication of his book, as what happened to him is so important for so many people.~~~If you are interested in more insight on Kalanithi, you may be interested in this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5u75..."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"This is Paul Kalanithi's life story. He relates how he got into neuroscience, his exhausting and life consuming training, his illness, and his eventual transition out of this world into the next.At first, Paul didn't even want to become a surgeon because his own father was one and he saw how hard it was to balance work and family: ""When we did see him, late at night or on weekends, he was an amalgam of sweet affections and austere diktats, hugs and kisses mixed with stony pronouncements ... He had reached some compromise in his mind that fatherhood could be distilled; short, concentrated (but sincere) bursts of high intensity could equal.. whatever it was that other fathers did. All I knew was, if that was the price of medicine, it was simply too high."" pgs 24-25, ebook.But, even though he started out as an English major, Paul's own interests led him towards the profession. He was passionate about medicine and making the best decisions for patients. He was interested in what makes life worth living and how the brain's functions effect quality of life. This is what he had to say after a sobering visit to a home for people who had suffered severe brain injuries as children: ""Only later would I realize that our trip had added a new dimension to my understanding of the fact that brains give rise to our ability to form relationships and make life meaningful. Sometimes, they break."" pg 34It was really difficult for me, personally, to read the parts of this memoir that dealt with Paul learning how to make life and death decisions for ailing patients. He talks in depth about taking people off of life support because they didn't want their bodies to be kept alive while their brains were gone. I was reminded of how my grandfather, though he never suffered any debilitating brain injury, was kept alive through endless medicines and machines to reduce the water around his heart. He eventually refused to eat and refused a feeding tube, so he slowly withered away.. this from a man who lived for eating and described the joys of consuming a fresh peach in summer as one of his favorite memories. It was heartbreaking. In this passage, one of Paul's professors is talking about the same type of situation with his own grandma: ""But ""what was most evident,"" he continued, ""was the slow drawing away from life... By the time Bubbeh stopped praying, she had stopped virtually everything else as well."" pg 41 ebook. Eating was my grandpa's form of prayer. So, you may want to avoid this memoir if you have any fresh grief that you're dealing with, as this book brings it all bubbling to the surface.Paul studies so hard to become a doctor to learn the secrets of life and death. But, he begins to realize, that as a doctor, he'll constantly deal with these moments but never truly understand them: ""I began to suspect that being so close to the fiery light of such moments only blinded me to their nature, like trying to learn astronomy by staring directly at the sun. I was not yet with patients in their pivotal moments, I was merely at those pivotal moments."" pg 56Then, he has his own illness and realizes that, even though he's seen death and suffering, he really knew nothing about it: ""It occurred to me that my relationship with statistics changed as soon as I became one."" pg 82. The rest of the book is so very sad, but one thing is clear, Paul Kalanithi finally found the moment when breath becomes air, what he had been searching for his whole life. Neurosurgeons write really fine memoirs. At least, that's been the case for nearly every one I've come across. Some read alikes, if you're interested: A Thousand Naked Strangers: A Paramedic’s Wild Ride to the Edge and Back by Kevin Hazzard (not a neurosurgeon, but Kevin talks about the burnout that comes in the medical community), Medicine, Miracles, and Manifestations: A Doctor's Journey Through the Worlds of Divine Intervention, Near-death Experiences, and Universal Energy by John L.

The yaksha asks: What is the most surprising thing in the world? to which the prince replies:""Everyday, living beings go to the abode of the God of Death. Yet even seeing this, the remaining wants to live on for ever. What can be more surprising than this?"" It is a fact that even after being aware of our mortality, we never think about it. Maybe it's a survival requirement, to avoid being in a permanent state of fatalism or anxiety. But the fact remains that each and every one of us is on the death row - only the date of execution is unknown. So we dream, make plans, and enjoy life without ever thinking of it coming to an end - like Paul Kalanithi, the author of this book, did.At age thirty-six, I had reached the mountaintop; I could see the Promised Land, from Gilead to Jericho to the Mediterranean Sea. I could see a nice catamaran on that sea that Lucy, our hypothetical children, and I would take out on weekends. I could see the tension in my back unwinding as my work schedule eased and life became more manageable. I could see myself finally becoming the husband I’d promised to be. Having finished his gruelling residency as a neurosurgeon, Paul is looking out to a bright future with his wife Lucy and their children to be - he is intent on saving his marriage which is almost on the rocks because of his punishing work schedule, and settling somewhere with a plum job. The only thing is, he has to get rid of this nagging back pain...... the nagging pain, which turns out to be lung cancer.Paul thus plummets from the pinnacle to the valley - from doctor, to terminal patient.The lung cancer diagnosis was confirmed. My carefully planned and hard-won future no longer existed. Death, so familiar to me in my work, was now paying a personal visit. Here we were, finally face-to-face, and yet nothing about it seemed recognizable. Standing at the crossroads where I should have been able to see and follow the footprints of the countless patients I had treated over the years, I saw instead only a blank, a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert, as if a sandstorm had erased all trace of familiarity. Thus arrived on the waste land of the spirit (the frequent references to T. S. Eliot are not coincidental), Paul sits back and takes stock of his life. What has he done so far, what can he do with the remaining time he has? Initially assured that his cancer is not progressing fast, he decides go back into surgery as planned earlier. He also decides to start a family, and accordingly stores his sperm in a sperm bank in anticipation of the possible side effects of chemotherapy. But without warning, his disease flares up - and Paul is left with no option but to withdraw into his role as the terminal patient: and write this memoir.""When Breath Becomes Air"" is a fascinating account by a person cursed (or blessed) to stand on both sides of the doctor-patient dyad. Paul evaluates his actions as a doctor through the lens of a terminal patient.If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining? Whatever life he has lived in the short span that fate, god, or blind chance (take your pick) had given him, Paul puts on the dissecting table, like the excellent surgeon he is, and holds up the different parts for the scrutiny of his readers. The result is an absorbing and heartbreaking tale of a brave and good human being and a sincere professional.We had assumed an onerous yoke, that of mortal responsibility. Our patients’ lives and identities may be in our hands, yet death always wins. Even if you are perfect, the world isn’t. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win for your patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving. In other words - just do your karma.***Paul Kalanithi died without completing this book. But in a way, this unfinished manuscript with an epilogue by his wife Lucy is perfect in its incompleteness. Paul's narrative ends with his message to his eight-month old daughter, as he holds her in his hands:When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing. One more quote before I end this review: this time from Lucy. It shows us Paul the man; sick and dying, yet with his beautiful humanity intact.At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know how to breathe.” ***Thank you, Paul Kalanithi. When the Pingala Keshini comes for me one day, I hope I will be able to meet her with as much fortitude as you did.------Pingala Keshini: The representation of death as a loathsome woman with reddish-brown hair, in some Indian alchemical texts."

Not in a happy and cool way but in a way that shook me and chilled me first and then slowly and then at once, left me broken. I loved it because it had its effect on me.I already knew about Paul and that he didn’t get to finish this book as he wanted to, so I was ready for the emotional effect this book might have on me. The foreword was very good and the prologue made me sad, but then Paul didn’t jump straight to his illness. Words have a longevity I do not. So there were basically two main parts to the book. The first about him choosing neurosurgery and dealing with patients and his understanding about life and death. The second about leaving all he knows to become a patient and to know the gaps between the two lives he couldn’t fill before, about facing death and dealing with his time.Shouldn’t terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death? What better way to understand it than to live it? But I’d had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle. I’d always imagined the doctor’s work as something like connecting two pieces of railroad track, allowing a smooth journey for the patient. I hadn’t expected the prospect of facing my own mortality to be so disorienting, so dislocating. I thought back to my younger self, who might’ve wanted to “forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race”; looking into my own soul, I found the tools too brittle, the fire too weak, to forge even my own conscience.I have had a little experience of myself with the things he discussed in part one. I was horrified and I was grateful. It had my heart constantly thumping and my eyes didn’t seem to leave the words even to blink. I was completely lost there. Then came the second part which went a little slow but then it just had me crying ugly till I finished it and the epilogue. I can’t rate anyone’s life but this book is really something.I pray that Lucy and Cady are well and happy.Highly Recommended.
My Thoughts as I Read:
(view spoiler)[I was such a mess. Didn’t write a word as I read. I hope I’ll live long enough that she has some memory of me. I had thought I could leave her a series of letters—but what would they say? I don’t know what this girl will be like when she is fifteen; I don’t even know if she’ll take to the nickname we’ve given her. There is perhaps only one thing to say to this infant, who is all future, overlapping briefly with me, whose life, barring the improbable, is all but past.That message is simple:When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied.

Though I'd never presume as much, I try to maintain my faith that a reason exists for the premature death of someone like Paul Kalanithi, who was ably devoted to giving so much. That is to say, I must have hope that Dr. Kalanithi, a mid-30s highly respected neurosurgeon with a loving wife and infant daughter, was empowered by his disease, as the best of empyreal messengers, to contemplate, conceive and write his message with a profundity that reminds readers that we are mortal, a reminder not in a melancholic or morbid sense, but as eyeing a morning glory, as we move forward on the road to the rest of our lives. Put another way, I need to believe in my soul that angels are among us.As I see it, his message is that we each will die, but we can live a meaningful life by giving of ourselves to make an impact on others, by trying to improve those around us by doing good deeds and by art, such as by creative writing. In this way, we may live on, as Dr. Kalanithi has managed through this sublime memoir.I found touching his wife's epilogue describing his monumental endeavor to write this memoir and I especially admired her strength to endure what must have been an extremely painful ordeal in writing of his last couple of weeks, when he could write no more."

Paul Kalanithi is the kind of guy you can't help but resent because he's such a good person. He's brilliant, altruistic, but not so perfect it's too good to be true. And apparently he's a naturally talented writer. I don't mean to be insensitive, and of course I don't envy what he and his family went through, but wow.

47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"What makes human life meaningful? Kalanithi, a thirty-six year old neurosurgeon, tried to locate the nexus of language between science and philosophy to answer the question. “Literature provide[s] the best account of a life of the mind, illuminates another’s experience, and provides the richest material for moral reflection.” There is messiness and weight in real human life that is not accounted for by science, says Kalanithi. Science and analytics (and atheism) cannot encompass all the mystery of human life. He gives the best argument I have heard for religious faith, suggesting that no one human has any answers because each individual has only piece of the puzzle. It is only in human connection that we can start to put the pieces together, making sense of the world. “Human knowledge grows in the relationships we form between each other and the world.”Science, created by human hands to make sense of the world, cannot contain the world. It doesn’t account for those things that make literature, and life, so compelling and so meaningful: “hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue…sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness…justice...goodness…mercy.” Questions without answers. Pieces of a puzzle.Kalanithi died of lung cancer shortly after writing these words. But he strove every day, in his work, in his studies, in his family and friends, to find meaning in life. He thought it might reside in words. Language. As a neurosurgeon he was taught, and he believed, that if a person lost the capacity to communicate--to speak or to understand language—their life became no life at all. He was a student of literature besides being a neurosurgeon, and in language was meaning. This memoir is Kalanithi’s attempt at connection. The Foreword is written by a Dr. Abraham Verghese, author of the unique and unforgettable novel about medicine and Africa, Cutting for Stone. The Epilogue is written by his wife, Lucy Kalanithi, also a doctor. Their words fore and aft add heft and a kind of imprimatur: this man really existed and, yes, he was as thoughtful as he appears. His life had meaning.Kalanithi changed my mind about something, and showed up a deficit, a smallness in my own thinking. I have always been suspicious of people who spend their lives in school, even though they might be concurrently working, piling up more and more degrees. Anybody can do that, I thought. Kalanithi completed a Bachelor's in English literature and human biology, a Master's in English literature, a degree from Cambridge in the history and philosophy of science and medicine, a medical degree with neuroscience and neurosurgery specializations. He was in his mid-thirties when he finally finished. And then he died. That last year he wrote this book and he managed to show me that, if one is focused and serious and seeks the critical nexus between life and death, one may begin to perceive the outlines of a moral philosophy that might help answer the large questions. We only have a lifetime to find meaning, and sometimes that lifetime is short.When Kalanithi talks of his 8-month old daughter shortly before his death, how she is all future and he is all past, we see what he sees: that their circles just touch, but don’t significantly overlap. She will never know him. This has the poignancy, truth, messiness, love, and tragedy of literature. Of life.I listened to the audio of this book, read by Sunil Malhotra and Cassandra Campbell. I have encountered Malhotra before and he is one of the best narrators in my experience. His pacing is perfect and he makes the reading very easy to follow. I ended up buying the hardcover because the book was so meaningful for me and because it is easy to pass around.“One key to managing a terminal illness is to be deeply in love, vulnerable, kind, generous, grateful.” –Lucy Kalanithi"
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This was a moving book written by a young doctor who was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. The memoir covers Paul's experiences as a medical student, why he chose to study medicine, and how quickly he had to adapt to being diagnosed with a deadly disease.Part of this book's meaning comes from the sense that it is unfinished, because Paul's life was cut short by cancer. There is a desperation to his writing, the urge to get thoughts down on paper NOW rather than later, knowing he didn't have much time left. There is poignancy in what he's written, and in the things he didn't have a chance to write. The book concludes with an emotional epilogue written by his wife, which wraps up the book well.I would recommend When Breath Becomes Air to those interested in cancer or medical stories, or those who appreciate an impassioned memoir.Favorite Quotes""My mother, afraid the impoverished school system would hobble her children, acquired, from somewhere, a 'college prep reading list.' Trained in India to be a physiologist, married at twenty-three, and preoccupied with raising three kids in a country that was not her own, she had not read many of the books on the list herself. But she would make sure her kids were not deprived. She made me read 1984 when I was ten years old; I was scandalized by the sex, but it also instilled in me a deep love of, and care for, language.""[on Paul's experience as a student]""Life felt rich and full, and over the next two years I kept at it, seeking a deeper understanding of a life of the mind. I studied literature and philosophy to understand what makes life meaningful, studied neuroscience and worked in an fMRI lab to understand how the brain could give rise to an organism capable of finding meaning in the world, and enriched my relationships with a circle of dear friends through various escapades.""""Time for me now is double-edged: every day brings me further from the low of my last relapse but closer to the next recurrence — and, eventually, death. Perhaps later than I think, but certainly sooner than I desire. There are, I imagine, two responses to that realization. The most obvious might be an impulse to frantic activity; to 'life life to its fullest,' to travel, to dine, to achieve a host of neglected ambitions. Part of the cruelty of cancer, though, is not only that it limits your time; it also limits your energy, vastly reducing the amount you can squeeze into a day. It is a tired hare who now races. And even if I had the energy, I prefer a more tortoiselike approach. I plod, I ponder, Some days, I simply persist."" [from the epilogue, written by Paul's wife]""Two days after Paul died, I wrote a journal entry addressed to [our daughter] Cady: 'When someone dies, people tend to say great things about him. Please know that all the wonderful things people are saying now about your dad are true. He really was that good and that brave.'"""

It ends with an epilogue written by Lucy Kalanithi, Paul's wife; her description of his last days and the enduring love she continues to feel for him are heartbreaking. Yet her words provide a fitting close to a book which, as she remarks, is largely about Paul as an individual, and illuminates the emotional impact of his illness on him and his family, something that his very matter of fact tone doesn't always reveal.While reading, I was reminded of the argument Atul Gawande makes in Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, that the levels and extent of medical intervention in the treatment of life changing or terminal illness needs to be directed by the choices of the individual, determined by what they consider to be the most important aspects of their life and how they want to spend the time they have left. With the help and support Lucy and his consultant, Emma, Paul seems to have been able to do this throughout most of his illness. Firstly, in his aim of returning to practice neurosurgery, then in the writing of this book, and finally the decision not to be intubated, instead choosing to spend time with his daughter and the rest of his family. It is this focus on individual choice that made the book feel empowering as well as moving. Paul was a man with an enquiring mind and a determined spirit, one who was resolved to maintaining the agency in his life. Because decisions about his care were based on his priorities, he was able to achieve the goals he set himself, including being able to set down the words within this book to speak for his experience and perhaps offer comfort, knowledge....something to those who read them. He stands as an example about how to live life and how to cope with death.Many thanks to Random House UK/Vintage Publishing and Netgalley for the opportunity to read this copy in exchange for an honest review."

This is very much the case for me with When Breath Becomes Air.If I had rated it the day I turned the last page, it would have been an easy five stars. The book had me captivated. A brilliant neurosurgeon gets late-stage cancer while still in his 30s and chronicles his journey from being a doctor, to a patient, to a father, to a dying man. Paul Kalanithi was a rare person. The epilogue from his wife had me crying in the Starbucks, and we’re not talking a quiet sort of eye-welling, we’re talking swollen face and muffled sobs. It’s absolutely heartbreaking. Yet here I am a month later, and other than the fantastic epilogue, I don’t remember the book very well. It doesn’t stick. Instead of recalling any of Kalanithi’s descriptions or insights, I am only left with an ephemeral sort of sadness. I feel terrible saying this because the book was so important to Kalanithi and he will never write again. I also feel bad because other GR reviews are filled with elegiac praise and it’s hard to stand apart from a group that you respect. But, in my case, the writing just wasn’t strong enough, and this wonderful man died before he could make it better. "

54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This is a fabulous book. Despite a bit of distancing, I as a reader got a really good idea of what it felt like to be diagnosed and to live with terminal cancer, both physically and psychologically, and also got a good sense of the experience of being trained to be a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist.It’s the kind of book that could easily be read in one or two sittings. I did not want to put it down. The loss of this man was a tragic one. Huge loss. For his family, for medicine, definitely personally. He was a wonderful man and I appreciated his honesty on these pages. I liked how he conveyed his decision making process and how he talked about quality of life issues. Even the seemingly ever present HOPE doctors insist upon he did in a mostly realistic manner. He was courageous and I admire how he tried to live the best rest of his life. His account was heartbreaking to read.Personally I could have done without some of the religious references but that is them and so I was fine with that. I did have personal and very strong negative feelings about this couple deciding to have a child together when they knew he would not survive that child’s childhood, but for this family I guess it worked. I really loved all the literary references!I so wanted to add my female authors shelf! His wife should have gotten credit for the very well written and important epilogue. Yes, I know this was Paul’s book and that he wrote it only after he was diagnosed and wrote it for his daughter, but it was unfinished when he died. And his wife Lucy’s portion was a great and for me needed addition to what Paul left. I appreciated how she described some things about him that didn’t come through as strongly in his portions, such as his wonderful sense of humor and his deep caring for friends & family. She did a great job and I’d love to read a full book by her. The epilogue was an important part of this book. But she is not credited/does not take credit as a coauthor, so I assigned only my male authors shelf. Between the two of them I got a good sense of them and their family members, friends, and colleagues. (I’m happy that Lucy has a good present: https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert... and I also have to read The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying by Nina Riggs.)"
55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,5,"I couldn't not rate this book 5 stars. I don't know if it was because it was non-fiction, and truly touching because of that, or because it was just so compulsively readable and fascinating, or maybe some other reason. All I know is this is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. And yes, I cried.Science has never really been a strong interest of mine, but this book has opened the floodgates in terms of pursuing scientific-based non-fiction in the future. Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and budding neuroscientist, and the vast knowledge that he imparted in this book was both fascinating and incredibly understandable for a novice like myself. I also loved how he managed to integrate the world of the arts with the world of science, two things that are usually seen as polar opposites. His musings on life and what it means to be were touching and I loved how he melded his scientific knowledge with ideas he had taken from the literary works he had read over the years.Kalanithi came across as a wonderful, caring, intelligent man who just wanted to help people through absolutely no selfish means. His writing flowed beautifully and I truly felt like I was close to him while reading and a real part of his story. However, it wasn't until the epilogue (written by his wife/widow Lucy Kalanithi) that I truly felt the sadness of his illness and what it really meant to be on the outside of it. Lucy's words on Paul's last days battling his terminal lung cancer were heartbreaking and I couldn't not cry. She wrote about him so beautifully though, and I thought it was a perfect ending to the sadly unfinished book.I would highly recommend everyone read this - it is a truly touching, well-written memoir, and something that I think everyone could enjoy and take something from, despite its sad subject matter."

I read this book because I found the topic mixed with the personal investment fascinating, but I also read it knowing it was going to be really sad and make me reflect on mortality and how we live our lives. This book provided me with everything I expected and also something new: a description in depth of the man behind Paul. How he grew up, what he believed it, how he viewed his career. This part of the book was my favourite because I think it was necessary. We really get to know Paul before we get to read his devastating account of what it’s like to live with terminal cancer; an account that his wife had to finish because Paul passed away before he could do so himself.

His life was dedicated to saving the lives of others and his work, in the area of neurosurgery, was renowned. But what happens to the mind of a man so used to being the savior, when he unexpectedly discovers he is to become the patient?From the synopsis, and numerous 5-star reviews I have read about this book, I knew this was going to break my heart. I did not expect it to have such a profound and lasting effect on me, however. Paul’s story is a sad and, unfortunately, not a rare one. The things he suffers have been suffered before. His story has been recounted and written of before. But never have I read such a sensitive and evocative account of such a thing; of a life taken far too soon.Paul truly came to life in these pages. I lived his joys and his successes; his heartbreak and his fears. I became a part of his family. I was invited to share details of his work life and his home love. I grew with Paul. And the story’s apex hurt me all the more because of it. I felt I got to intimately know a brilliant individual and the story’s unavoidable apex hit me like the loss of a loved one, rather than that of an actual stranger.Paul’s story is one worthy to be told and shared, but it is the way it is delivered that really makes it stand-out. Because Paul, as well as being an illustrious surgeon and a proficient writer, was also a wonderful human being with so much to teach us all. He gracefully deals with and recounts traumatic subject matters and triggering topics, and skillfully weaves the narrative of his own life into instructions on how to make our own a better one.This is blurbed as being a must-read for trainee doctors. But I would say it is a must-read for any human, who wishes to face all this world has to throw at us and still keep our humanity intact. It is not our closeness to tragedy that will ruin us, it is our growing ease with it that will, in an ever-increasingly violent world.Paul invites us to share his story and his pain, and to remember that pain every time we allow ourselves to let our humanity slip. Every hurt has a human face. No story is void of characters. Paul will live on through the sharing of his story, but also in making his readers live a life filled with compassion in kindness, no matter the adversity to be faced."

What a beautiful, inspirational and thought-provoking memoir. The quote above is central to When Breath Becomes Air, first as he helps his patients to address this issue, and then as he has to do so himself. I found the first chapters very interesting as it deals with neuroscience and -surgery, and his thoughts on the doctor-patient relationship. But I loved the second half of the book where he takes us on his journey once he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Obviously it is sad, but he shows us that ""Death may be a one-time event, but living with a terminal illness is a process."" Paul goes through this process with integrity and empathy. I also admire his wife for her strength and her epilogue really touched my heart. Highly recommended. "

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1834059-april,3,"I received this book from Goodreads First Reads.Overall I enjoyed this book, however I did enjoy the afterword written by Paul's wife, Lucy, better than the rest of the book. Here's why:1. I'm not a huge fan of classic literature...Whitman, Dickens, Twain, Austen, etc. There were a lot of references to authors and titles that I have never heard of. I don't really care for the language used in the classics and I often felt like the flow of this book took that tone.2. I'm also not a fan of books using big words, when I have to look up too many words to understand what the author is trying to say I lose interest or just skim through those parts of the book. It's the authors love of language and style of writing that I just don't appreciate. 3. There were a lot of technical terms and procedures that he was explaining in the book that related to the field of medicine. This coupled with the large words he used made me lose interest.4. Lucy was able to describe very complex emotions and Paul's final days with a touch of simplicity that was interesting and engaging to me. It didn't feel complicated to me when reading the afterword - it felt more emotional. There is one line in the book that I did mark that I feel sums this book up beautifully: ""...even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living."" It's how Paul lived his life before he was even diagnosed with Cancer, which made him a fantastic doctor and on through his last days. Now that I've probably made myself look very uneducated....those who have a love of classic literature and a large vocabulary will most likely enjoy this book. Despite the things I didn't like about the book I feel this one is worth a read. The content and character of this book has a lot to offer. "

But above all see what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone by your words.” From the forward by Abraham Verghese.Paul Kalanithi was a very brave man with the talent and promise of becoming a brilliant neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with cancer in his last year of residency. He also loved literature which is so evident in his beautiful and stunning writing. “Frail but never weak” he entered into his earthly life’s final transformation on his own terms, the reflections of which would make for rich and insightful conversation in a group setting. How often have we heard the question If you only had 6 months to live what would you do with the precious time left, especially when each day can redefine your value system. I would have loved to explore his thoughts and choices with fellow readers.One of my favorite sections of this narrative is the epilogue by Paul’s wife Lucy. It stands on its own as a poignant witness and testimony to a man greatly respected and well loved. As she stated ""My marriage didn't end when I became a widow.” and in describing his memoir she wrote:“He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life and his book explores that essential territory.” I listened to the very excellent audio version and highly recommend it.

I finished this book around 4am, tears streaming down my cheeks and a set-too-soon alarm looming in the future. That was over six months ago, but the whole time I prepared to write this review, I get sucked back into that moment. 
“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.” 
As both a medical professional and someone with chronic illness (requiring hospitalizations in the past) I am still stunned how Kalanthi grappled with these two halves of being. The story he shared  is personal, quietly profound and encourages empathy. Everyone has a story. I’m glad Kalanthi and his family shared theirs-- and encouraged us to listen to others."

Before he encountered late stage lung cancer his love of literature and medicine filled him with desire to better understand the human condition .

67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334938-taryn,5,"A short and powerful memoir about living in the face of death.At 36 years old, neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. When Breath Becomes Air was written in his final months. In this thoughtful and deeply personal memoir, Dr. Kalanithi explains the questions of life-and-death that drove him to become a neurosurgeon. Over the course of the book, he ponders the role of the doctor and what makes life meaningful enough to go on living.
The physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.
This is a one-sitting book. Not only is it short in pages, but it's also small in size and spacious in formatting. Dr. Kalanithi's love of language and literature is evident in his writing. The writing is poetic and he frequently references relevant passages from great books. When Breath Becomes Air is divided into two parts: Part 1: In Perfect Health I Begin and Part 2: Cease Not till Death. In Part 1, before his diagnosis, he reflects on his childhood, education, and career. He shares some of the pivotal moments in his life and we witness how seriously he takes his duty to his patients. In Part 2, after his diagnosis, he copes with becoming the patient after years of being the doctor. Always fascinated with the line between life and death, his philosophical questions suddenly become devastatingly relevant. At the end, there is an epilogue written by his wife Lucy. While most of the book is philosophical in nature, Lucy writes about the concrete details and the emotional impact of caring for Paul in his final months and of life after his passing. It is a beautiful testament to her husband.
I began to realize that coming in such close contact with my own mortality had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.
While it had the potential to be completely depressing, it is more a celebration of life. There is no wallowing in grief, only the commitment to keep living:""until I actually die, I am still living."" Despite the personal stakes, Dr. Kalanithi writes with surprising objectivity and rationality, almost detachment. It wasn't until Part 2, when his daughter was born, that I became emotional. After that point, it was extremely difficult to continue reading through my tears. Below is the last paragraph before the epilogue (skip if you need to), one of the most touching and heartbreaking things I have ever read:(Directed to his infant daughter) When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.I admired Dr. Kalanithi's honesty, commitment to life-long learning, and for generously sharing his thought process from his final year. I desperately hoped for a different ending, even though I knew it wasn't possible. Intellectually I know that death happens every second of the day, and to everyone eventually, but it is still difficult to accept that such a thoughtful and vibrant mind could be gone from this earth. I wish he could know how deeply his book has affected so many people! I'm glad he wrote it and to know that it will be there when I need it most (hopefully not for a long time). This novel is relevant to everyone, because we are all living in the face of death. If you enjoyed Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, you will probably enjoy this book. I didn't enjoy Gilead when I read it, but I think I owe it a reread.The earth is quickly turned over by worms, the processes of nature marching on, reminding me of what Paul saw and what I now carry deep in my bones, too: the inextricability of life and death, and the ability to cope, to find meaning despite this, because of this. What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy. (Lucy's Epilogue)"

I do think they pair nicely together. Both are written by surgeons! Atul Gawande has had a long career in which he has had to learn about working with patients, and has some informed views on death and dying. Paul Kalanithi was still completing his residency in neurosurgery when he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and is able to speak from dual perspectives of surgeon and patient. I enjoyed reading Kalanithi because he is just so intelligent. He has received degrees in English and biology/medicine, even both at the graduate level, because he was trying to find the best way to explore the idea of what makes us think, how do the mind and brain connect, and what does that mean for our humanity? He is deep and his education has been an intense one. At times it felt a bit name-dropping but I suppose his humanity is also being a surgeon (traditionally a healthy slice of ego there) - I imagine if he had lived to see the finishing of this book and worked with an editor, they may have talked him out of a few mentions of schools or feeling the need to explain something along the line of ""nobody else was smart enough to do this but I was."" Overall this isn't even a complaint, this is his personality, and it is coupled with a serious desire to understand and contribute. Here are a few examples that resonated with me:""There is a moment - a cusp - when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.""""After so many years of living with death, I'd come to understand that the easiest death was not necessarily the best.... We decided to have a child. We would carry on living, instead of dying.""""I needed words to go forward. And so it was literature that brought me back to life....""""Even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living."" The end includes an epilogue by his wife, and while I can appreciate her desire to restate why he was a significant person, I found it unnecessary. The work, the thinking, stands for itself. And even with a parent with very serious illness (nobody is using the word terminal except sarcoma always is), I found this book uplifting in the sense that there is an understanding about the inevitability of death here. For some reason that is soothing to me."

When your perspective is broadened, your thinking changes, and your own way of living opens up for self-examination. All of this impacts how you move forward with your life...thus the change.Paul Kalanithi's memoir offers perspective about living in regards to the detached medical science of function, the philosophy and theology of being present, and the desperate need we all have to process and feel human emotion. I am urged to view my physicians as emotional human beings and not the white coats with all (or none) of the answers. I am urged to show love and appreciation daily to my family. I am urged to confront my discomfort and make every effort to spend time and unfiltered conversation with the terminally ill. What true perspective we miss out on when we withdraw from the dying, but the true tragedy is how avoidance negatively impacts quality of life and authentic human connections. I loved this book.My favorite quote:“Relying on his own strength and the support of his family and community, Paul faced each stage of his illness with grace—not with bravado or a misguided faith that he would “overcome” or “beat” cancer but with an authenticity that allowed him to grieve the loss of the future he had planned and forge a new one. He cried on the day he was diagnosed. He cried while looking at a drawing we kept on the bathroom mirror that said, “I want to spend all the rest of my days here with you.” He cried on his last day in the operating room. He let himself be open and vulnerable, let himself be comforted. Even while terminally ill, Paul was fully alive; despite physical collapse, he remained vigorous, open, full of hope not for an unlikely cure but for days that were full of purpose and meaning.”"

It is a beautiful, heartrending, deeply philosophical piece by an accomplished young man who dedicated heart and mind to his work and study in neurosurgery. He discovers that he has terminal lung cancer at the age of 36, just before completing his grueling neurosurgical residency and embarking on the career he has worked so hard to attain. The book is very thoughtful and reflective in nature, especially upon the meaning of life. It made me wonder if the author was truly always so interested in finding the meaning of life, or if only when told of this terminal diagnosis, that reflection back on his life made this search so apparent. As one nears death, what is most important, becomes glaringly more obvious, and Paul Kalanithi describes this so well.Abraham Verghese speaks in the foreword of how he had met Paul in person several times before his death, but it was not until he read his book that he felt he really knew him. I too, felt like I got to know Paul through this book. He is very open and honest about himself, his sickness, his relationships, and struggles and triumphs throughout the process of dealing with cancer.I find it interesting that Paul did not always think he wanted to be a physician, but rather thought he might be a writer. He may not have realized his full potential as neurosurgeon and professor, but he surely achieved his goal to be a writer. He has left behind a beautiful book that will be read for many years to come. It will be of great interest to those with life-threatening disease, their family members, and really everyone, because we will all be in those shoes at some point. He has also left behind a wonderful gift of himself to his daughter. She will not remember her time with him, but she will be able to know him through this book and well as through the memories that I’m sure his close relations will share with her. Aside from writing and even delving back into neurosurgery residency at one point, he spent the last years of his life following his diagnosis, building closer bonds with his family, and the love there was overflowing.Aside from being an important read for anyone facing a life-threatening illness themselves or loving someone who is, I think it is a very important read for all medical professionals. It puts a face behind a patient, who is clearly able to articulate the thoughts and feelings of being a patient in our medical system. It emphasizes and highlights the importance of the physician-patient relationship.I give this novel 5 stars, for it’s thought provoking, beautiful prose, as well as for writing it’s way through a death with utmost dignity. He strengthens his belief systems, forges stronger relationships with family and loved ones, and finds greater meaning in life once he is given this terminal diagnosis.For discussion questions, please visit my blog: http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=70 "

In this case, I found the style of writing tedious, I'm a voracious reader but the flow of my reading pace was often broken in looking up a word here or there as Paul used quite, we'll be honest, pretentious words and references which made him harder to relate to. He wanted to come across as well educated and intelligent, and yes he did, however, it's difficult to form a connection with people of a lower education (which I imagine is the vast majority of readers!). Even though the subject matter, Paul's cancer,is so personal and relatable to so many, you never feel that connection or humanness to Paul. There's little to no vulnerability in his writing. He's factual and rational, which makes sense as he was a doctor but in order to connect to the reader there needs to be that vulnerability, that rawness. Throughout the whole book I could not form an attachment to him, however in just one chapter I connected with his wife. He seemed to distance himself, talking philosophically instead of personally, prose instead of reality, never being straight and open, rather using someone else's words to express himself. I would much rather have gotten to know the man rather than have many sections of the book taken up by references to other works, it highlights a lack of expression, unable to voice it himself, he expressed himself through others. That itself is no harm but not when writing an autobiography. Paul died and that is incredibly devastating for his family and friends, this review means no disrespect, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that even though he died from cancer, I should not let that colour my opinion of this book. I know the subject matter is his life and illness, but the style of writing was too contrived, it just didn't flow well. I can understand I may not be the most intelligent of people, but I'm not an idiot, I still needed to look up my fair share of the archaic and obscure words. Overall, I found the medical side of things interesting, as that is my profession, but I wouldn't read When Breath Becomes Air again and I wouldn't recommend it to family or friends. I do extend my sympathies to Paul's family's for their loss."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"This is a brilliant book as the author grapples with the knowledge and consequences of a terminal cancer prognosis like most anyone would. How Kalanithi is different is that he pulls together and synthesizes CP Snow's Two Cultures, as his life is equally immersed in the humanities with philosophy and literature, on one hand, as it is in the science and technology fields, on the other. There are no ideologies left behind from his analysis of his and our mortality and struggles to understand our attempts to live a good life. I'd read some of what he'd journaled here before on a blog that was kept documenting struggle with his disease and living a life (as we all do, really, echoing Becker's The Denial of Death), knowing death is possibly imminent. (A nursing student in my SOC course told me I *had* to check it out, and for once I was glad to have taken the advice!) I didn't cry until the lovely and obviously equally brilliant wife's parts at the end, giving a conclusion to her own life's story, in part.Kalanithi's reflections on life and death remind one of Aristotle's claims (a good one to recommend to students to share around a holiday family dinner table) that we're all Gods with anuses, with transcendent minds that have perspective and can cognate on our own mortality yet are mere animals with the mortal bodies that go along with them."

Paul Kalanithi was a young man of 36, just a few months shy of completing ten years of training as a neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic lung cancer. He had a great academic career ahead of him as a neuroscientist and neurosurgeon but suddenly that is all taken away from him. In his memoir he reflects back on his life, his search for meaning, his studies in English and philosophy before deciding he wanted to become a doctor. He talks about the long hours of surgery as he refines his skills, and the way he has learnt to talk to patients, gauging what they need to know when they are ready to hear it. He finds his own transition from doctor to patient difficult but reflects on how to lead a meaningful life in the face of impending death. After his diagnosis Paul and his wife Lucy, also a physician made the decision to have a child, even though Paul knew he would not be around to watch her grow up. His final paragraph is heart wrenching as he tells his daughter how much joy she brought him in his brief time with her. Paul Kalanithi died less than two years after his diagnosis without being able to complete his book. His final few weeks and subsequent death are left for his wife Lucy to describe which she does most eloquently. Although this is a sad read, the message is that we should live our lives with meaning and purpose and joy no matter how much time is left to us."
78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89,2,"""Even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.""At the age of thirty-six, neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. What happens when the doctor becomes the patient?Unfortunately, this one was simply not for me. I sympathised with Kalanithi, but at no point did I feel any real connection with him, which I think is crucial in order to fully appreciate this kind of memoir. I found his writing style to be quite dry and clinical, and I would zone out at times while listening. My favourite part of the book was actually the epilogue that his wife had written following his death. Her writing was beautiful and almost moved me to tears.As always the ratings that I give for memoirs are solely based on enjoyment factor. Who am I to judge anyone's personal thoughts, reflections and life? Although I didn't enjoy this, I wouldn't dissuade others from reading it given how many people simply loved it. Give it a shot if it appeals to you."
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27482054-huyen-chip,5,"While reading the book, I had to put it down many times to think. It took dying for Paul to write. It'd take me a lifetime to learn from it.We all know that we'd one day die, but we're always surprised when that day comes. Paul, as his wife wrote in the epilogue, not only described the terrain but also traversed it bravely. In the process, he taught us to find the meaning of our own lives, to be the best possible versions of ourselves, and to face our own demise. Death is not an enemy that we need to fight. It's a fact that we need to accept and reconcile with our living. I will treasure the book for as long as I live. When my day comes, I will again look it up for encouragement. "
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4403102-karan-bajaj,4,"I've found books in the same genre of young folks facing their sudden mortality a little full of platitudes and false bravado so I was on the fence about picking up When Breath Becomes Air. But I read an excellent review from a reviewer I greatly respect on Goodreads so I bought it. This is a profound read, deeper than any other book in the genre, and searingly honest. Paul was extremely vulnerable with his own insecurities and doubts in the face of mortality despite being a lifelong philosopher. Yet it fell short of giving a glimpse of the pure transcendence that I thought Paul was close to uncovering. His conclusions in the end--family, meaningful work, striving, love--were almost too logical. I wanted to know a deeper insight that shimmers just below the surface and becomes accessible when all dross is stripped off from the soul. Ultimately, that's not the book's shortcoming as much as mine. I want answers from a universe that doesn't give them easily. Paul asked the right questions and perhaps that's enough."

Knowing Paul Kalanithi died when still working on that book makes it even more poignant and heartbreaking. Literally made me left gasping for air when reading his memoir. He was a man of integrity and true inspiration. Faced with terminal illness he remained positive and dignified, living his life to the fullest, trying to not only be the best doctor but also husband and father (despite only having little time with his daughter who was born few months before his passing) he could be. We could all learn from him to make the most of our lives, make them meaningful, to be grateful and compassionate. A book that will stay with me for a long time."

Years of preparation and study were about to pay off as Paul was gearing up for his future as his graduation drew closer. But life had other plans. Paul went from a neurosurgeon full of compassion and potential to a patient with an unknown amount of life left. As Paul was trying to navigate his new life, he kept looking for the best use of the time he had left. In the end, he decided to write and reflect. This is his story.This is a short book but do not be deceived by the length. This book packs a punch. Paul Kalanithi was staring at his mortality straight on with every word that he wrote. Paul had degrees in Biology, Science and English. All throughout his upbringing and education, he pondered on the meaning of life. Ultimately deciding that being a doctor would give him the best view, he chose neurosurgery. Paul worked extensively and already had big plans upon finishing his residency. This is a beautiful memoir. Its sad yet uplifting. Paul does not seek pity, he wanted to impart evrything he had learned on this journey. In doing so, he celebrated his life and gave us an insight into how to enjoy our own in the best way possible. I love the introduction by Abraham Verghese but I was absolutely taken in by the afteward written by his wife (and fellow doctor) Lucy Kalanithi. I knew the outcome and yet I hoped Paul would recover. Dr. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015 (22 months since being diagnosed), which was not just great loss to his family but also to the medical profession. But he left a great legacy behind, one that one day his daughter will be very proud of. Heartfelt, profound, emotional, poetic and inspiring this is a book I would recommend to everyone. It will stick with for a long while."
85,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,0,This is one of those books - a neurosurgeon steeped in literature who writes a memoir while he's dying from cancer - that if you write anything negative you would be scorned by polite society.So . . . .

'Cause I literally found ways to escape from Christmas cooking just to be able to read more of this book. And like I said in one of my updates, I had zero intentions of reading this novel this year, however, for whatever reason when I passed by it, I picked it up, and began reading it. Quite honestly, this random decision might have been one of my best decisions this month.I knew going into this that Paul Kalanithi was going to die from his sickness (it's literally on the back of the cover folks) - and I thought I would cry at the end. In fact, I was pretty sure of it. Instead, I got teary eyed, but I didn't cry. Like his wife, Lucy, put it, Paul looked death right in the eye and accepted his fate with unwavering bravery. And because of his bravery and strength, I did not think it was right to cry when I read about his death. I don't think he would have wanted that.Since I am also very interested in books/literature/writing and on the flip-side, medicine/science/health, his novel really resonated with me. After all, Paul felt the same way about medicine and literature as I do, right now. That understanding that I'm not the only one to have two loves that are so different, and yet, so intertwined, really made me fall in love with this novel more. Paul understood and saw the parallels that so many people today fail to realize. Because if I had a quarter for every time someone laughed and said: ""How can you major in English and Biology? How does that even work?"" Lets just say, I would have a lot of quarters. Paul was not only a brilliant doctor, author, and teacher, but he was also a wonderful husband and father. Reading about his interpretations of the world, and what he was going through, was beyond pleasurable and I would recommend this novel to anyone/everyone.Overall, I'm extremely pleased to have picked this up so randomly. Though, now that I think about it, there probably was a reason that I randomly began reading it. I learned so much about myself through Paul's words and observations, and I thank him for that. I really do."

“If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?”
“What is the meaning of life?” This question haunts everyone at least once in their lifetime. From the ones going through dire circumstances to the ones drawing their final breath on the deathbed, each of us question if our life has a purpose and what makes it worth living.“When breath becomes air” is one such a story about a neurosurgeon’s examination of his life when he gets diagnosed with lung cancer. At 36 when Paul is about to finish his residency, he has the exact vision of how his life would look like. But his world turns upside down when he learns he doesn’t have much time left to live.In this memoir, Paul reflects on his early life when he was struggling to find his identity. He talks about the events that led him to choose neurosurgery as his profession and his eventual journey from becoming a doctor to becoming a patient.The writing is beautiful. It is powerful because of its honesty, vulnerability, and hope in the face of tragedy. There are questions and then there are conclusions. There is a deep contemplation about life, identity, purpose, and mortality. It makes you scrutinize your life and the world around you.This book gives us insight into Paul’s life as a doctor and how his perspective about looking at death changes after he confronts his own. I’m amazed by Paul’s indomitable spirit and the way he navigates through his life after learning about his illness.This book is incomplete as Paul could not finish it in time. Nevertheless, he gave his best until the end. Life is short and unpredictable so we should make the most of whatever time we have left. That’s how Paul lived his life and this book will inspire you to do the same."

As others have noted, for such a short book When Breath Becomes Air seems to have meant an impressive number of things to different readers. While I was moved by many things about this book, including the more personal messages Paul provided for his wife and daughter (as well as his wife's afterword), I particularly appreciated Paul's tireless striving for a meaningful life, and I was intrigued by his exploration of the distinction between the brain and the mind--a distinction I have often pondered myself, albeit without Paul's expertise. I can't think of a person I wouldn't recommend this book to. Paul's intellect, obvious humanity, and willingness to bare his soul add up to a memoir that's even more than the sum of its considerable parts.I won this book via Shelf Awareness. There was no expectation of a review."
