0,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana,2,"As a mathematics teacher and long-time student of mathematics, I was overjoyed when I came across this book. Finally, I thought, an ode to the profound beauty and elegance of this most precise and direct human languages. And, hopefully, an expose on the state of mathematics education, and a plea to change course, maybe even some practical suggestions on how we may begin to do this.Lockhart and I started in lock-step. YES. The current state of mathematics education is a TRAVESTY - we are most emphatically not teaching students to fully appreciate its abstractive powers, philosophical implications, and inherent structure. Instead, we are taking the artifacts of doing mathematics and positing that these are what math is about. An example: numbers.My absolute favorite. As a math teacher, I get this a lot on my first day of a new school year, ""Ms. S., what 36*129?"" I am, of course, expected to do this quickly without a calculator. Since, unfortunately, most students have been taught to think that math is about numbers, or shapes, or equations, or graphs, or in general, mathematical objects. Mathematician Paul Halmos (1916-2006) wrote an excellent essay on this misconception. An excerpt: ""to begin with, mathematicians have very little to do with numbers. You can no more expect a mathematician to be able to add a column of figures rapidly and correctly than you can expect a painter to draw a straight line or a surgeon to carve a turkey-popular legend attributes such skills to these professions, but popular legend is wrong. There is, to be sure, a part of mathematics called number theory, but even that doesn't deal with numbers..."" PDF File here (YES! What number theory is about, by the way, is the concept of counting; numbers are but an artifact…) I’ve never been a human-computer type of whiz-kid, and I can’t compute ‘in my head’, without the aid of pen and paper. I don’t, in fact, even like numbers particularly, and thankfully never had to deal with them much in school (as a math major). I’m not even a quantitative type of person. And I certainly do not believe in the applicability of mathematics to all human endeavors (well, I believe it can be applied in every circumstance, but not with positive effects; take, for example, the current testing regime in education as a prime example of the devastation that can be wreaked by our belief in numbers to solve all problems).But, I still love math. And I choose to prove my teacher worthiness by beginning the year-long conversation with my students about how math is not about its objects, but is rather a language. A language unlike any other we speak, one predicated on conciseness, precision, and directness. A language that may also be applied widely, but with caution and attention to ethical and social implications. ---But let me get back on task. So I absolutely agree with Lockhart: mathematics, as language, is an art. It is indeed a tragedy that in too many schools today, math education consists of futile exercises in computation, memorization of formulas, of solving contrived word problems, and, more recently, manifests as an endless quest to eliminate wrong answer choices on standardized tests. YES of course I agree: math should not be taught in procedural fashion, formulas should not be blindly memorized, problems should not be contrived to be about “real life” situations.I’m also in agreement that we need to invest in programs that will train all of our math teachers in formal mathematics. At the moment, most math teachers in the US have transitioned from the workforce (engineering mostly, some physics and other sciences) or have degrees in math education. It is my and Lockhart’s contention that a deep understanding of the subject is required in order to be able to relate the essence of math. [In an ironic twist, badly applied quantitative measures of unquantifiable phenomena (such as the experience of student learning) suggests that math degrees don’t make a difference in terms of student “success” (See this  Edweek Article)]. While I agree with Lockhart’s assessment of the inadequacy of the current state of math education, I strongly dissent to his suggestions for how we should move towards reform. A Mathematician’s Lament lacks any kind of historical understanding, and does not at all consult pedagogical and curriculum literature.For example, Lockhart writes that “word problems” should not be contrived to be about real life (I agree with this point), but then he continues that mathematics is beautiful precisely because it is irrelevant to ‘real life’..I cannot comprehend how another mathematician could possibly believe the beauty of mathematics comes from the ""irrelevance"" of its abstractions: in fact, the reason math is SO powerful is that these abstract representations have all been historically ""discovered"" or ""invented"" (depending on what you believe math is: inherent in the world, or a human game of abstraction)--particularly in order to try to model and explain phenomena observed in ""the real world.""Lockhart says math was created by humans ""for their own amusement"" (p. 31), but ignores that in fact all branches of mathematics in the past were created in response to actual world problems, and not only that, but now, some of the most fascinating mathematics is being created again in response to solving some of the most complex problems we have imagined, such as the mathematics behind string theory. I don't know how Lockhart could possibly consider that humans invented counting, ways to measure their plots of land and keep track of money, or ways to measure the orbits of planets (thus leading us to the current ""space age"") as ""purely amusement""--perhaps, if life is amusement in general, but really, all of these inventions had a very real, concrete, specific historical cultural purpose and are not ""just made up"" for fun!!I teach functions (precalculus, AP calculus) and the main theme is how basically, in life, we track patterns of change in anything and everything--public health data, unemployment, polling, the stock market, baseball stats, etc. Functions are just the most abstract way to represent these changing patterns over time (or some other variable) and thus give us the powerful tool of projecting into the future/past and otherwise analyzing trends. Yes, functions are abstract, but they are not ""just fantasy play,"" irrelevant to the real world, or made up simply for the fun of it, in fact, quite the opposite of all of these.My (and I believe, many) students would be aghast to learn that someone is suggesting an overhaul of math education based on the idea that ""kids don't really want something that is relevant to their daily lives."" This is the most absurd statement I have ever read so I am guessing Lockhart knows nothing about adolescent/child development, interest, and pedagogical literature. Learning in general is based on making connections to prior knowledge, and I have never heard any question asked more often in math class when I didn't explain the relevance in advance than ""Why do I need to know this? How is this relevant to my life?"" This is probably the MOST pressing question for adolescents in general…* (See very long note on Dualism in Lockhart & Real Life Applications)Other examples of pedagogical tragedies in this book include Lockhart's admonitions that ""you can't teach teaching,"" that ""schools of education are a complete crock"" and that teachers shouldn't lesson plan because this is somehow ""not real"" or authentic (p. 46-47). While I agree schools of education are not preparing our teachers well and what we need is much more systemic training in content knowledge, it is absolutely not supported by any peer-reviewed research that teaching is something you ""have"" that you don't need to ""learn"" and, further, that you shouldn't plan because this is inauthentic.A plan should of course never prevent a teacher from moving in new directions as suggested by the course of the class, but coming in without a plan is certainly not considered sound practice in any theory of learning and from any angle, and in general is not a sound principle of life (i.e., just doing everything by the seat of your pants and counting on your ""genius"" to lead you through whatever you should have planned usually doesn't work, unless you are in a feel-good movie). Only in Lockhart's fantasy ""lala land"" of irrelevancy is planning a vice and not a virtue. Plus, there's so much more to ""planning"" than thinking about the flow of the lesson, how you will help students make connections, etc. I assess and plan hand in hand for example, and I tailor my classes for my particular students that year. *Very Long Note on Dualism in Lockhart & Real World Applications Math is a language, and as such, art, that captures the most abstract essence of our world. Some even go as far to say that math is a structure of our very universe (see Penrose and Tegmark); I’m trudging through their work at the moment and am not convinced, but this may change.Rather, what I’ve always believed is that math is embodied in our cognitive schemas and perception, and that this is precisely what makes it so wonderful: humanity's inherent capacity for thinking about the real world in this abstract way (see  Where Mathematics Come From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being  by George Lakoff & Rafael Núñez). The point is, these ideas are born in experience: and, in turn, our experiential perceptions are shaped by these ideas, creating the cyclical process of learning and expanding our horizons. From this perspective, in which experience/perception are perpetually interconnected to our cognitive schemas in a cycle of expansion, to say as Lockheart does, that math, or that anything, for that matter, is purely ""of the mind"" is basically Descartes all over again, “only the thought exists”. And we all know how well that turned out.Now, I am not proposing the other side of the dualistic coin: teaching “math for engineering” type courses in which the emphasis is on the application. What I think is essential is to teach math in the context of its history, its applicability, its ethics, its abstractive prowess, its meaning.Nothing is ""born in our mind"" alone; nothing exists in our ""mind"" alone; and for anything to make sense, the very idea of something having a sense, comes from our experiential perception.Example #1: take the case of Zero (see Charles Seife's  Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea). We tend to think of ""0"" as a number, perhaps like any other, but this is far from accurate. Zero has a complex history within that of counting, and it was not at first even considered a number, but a place holder for ""nothing."" While anthropologists have discovered potential counting artifacts as old as 30,000 years, zero is only a few thousand of years old, if that. It took many tens of thousands of years after the adoption of numbers to ""invent"" the concept of ""zero""-most likely because zero/the idea of cataloging “nothing” was not part of the daily experience of tracking items, livestock, or people. In fact, mathematicians to this day continue to refer to the set of integers ""1"" and above as “natural numbers”, and do not include 0 in this set. Example #2: the concepts of positive and negative, the number line as a construct. The number line parallels our perceptive ability to set dualistic reference points in/with our bodies, such as east-west, up-down, right-left, and so on; this reference-setting tendency is further related to our bipedal structure. Of course, we also think in terms of “continuums”, mostly one-dimensional (linear). I often wonder what our mathematics would be like if humans had the anatomy of octopuses! I read this book some time ago (2008?). Posted the first review in 2010, which has been significantly edited from its original version in this April 30, 2016 update"
1,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/994266-angela,2,"A Mathematician's Lament is more of a long essay than a book--one man's problems with mathematics education without a viable solution. Now, I consider myself, while no mathematician, a mathematics...enthusiast, if you will. I read the occasional recreational mathematics book, I am one of the three people on earth who subscribes to the journal of recreational mathematics, I am constantly sneaking new variations on Tangrams and other puzzles into the house. And I am definitely not a fan of modern American elementary education; I consider my public school education to have prepared me adequately enough for the world, but it did seem largely like a waste of time. Oh, those purple dittos with the blocks that had to be colored in based on the results of math problems -- they were my nemesis, and not because I couldn't do arithmetic. So partly, I think his argument - that mathematics education gets tripped up in unnecessary formalism and syntax before conceptually interesting problems are tackled, and that the whole thing is defended with the ridiculous ""you might need this someday"" pragmatism that children will instantly tune out - is a sound one. It would be great if every elementary school teacher were the kind of engaged leader capable of putting his or her students to work on an interesting geometry or abstract algebra problem and wandering around not to give answers, but to provide the occasional hint. Unfortunately, I just don't see how this is going to provide anyone with a well-rounded mathematics education. Lockhart argues that what they get now -- not learning anything because they're so bored -- is worse. It's tempting to believe all of this. And yet, I couldn't get a nagging thought out of my mind: I managed to get through all that arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus with an ability to apply most of it. I didn't go through school memorizing formulas and I never felt forced to do so either; to this day I couldn't tell you most trig identities without starting at the Pythagorean theorem and deriving them. Is the state of things really that bad? Even accepting that it is, Lockhart's book is breezy and quick....what might have been called a pamphlet, perhaps, in earlier days. And like satirical pamphlets, it does an excellent job lampooning the state of things but offers very little in the way of realistic alternatives. I am all ears to hear new ways of teaching children math; I imagine classrooms could be greatly improved by incorporating topics from recreational math, calculus, and abstract algebra at an earlier age, and have never understood the obsession with arithmetic that dominates the first years of mathematics education. But Lockhart doesn't provide much in the way of real solutions--just the clue that he really likes circumscribed triangle problems. Spend all of mathematics class playing chess and go? That might be fun, but I'm unconvinced that the primary purpose of school is to entertain."
2,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,4,"Definietly a must read for all math teachers. I was starting to get a bit bored in the end, but when I started to realize that, the book was over. Paul Lockhart shows where the current system leads us to: a mass productions of pattern-recognition machines (read: students). I really liked the introduction parable."
3,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806278-sally,4,"I know - 4 stars? Really? The content and the ideas and the presentation are 5-star material. He's a bit crude sometimes, and there's a particularly hedonistic phrase used near the end of the book (part 2, not the free essay material) that I felt was just unneeded. And since I recommended this to all my dear homeschooling friends, some of whom have tender sensibilities, I knocked a star off. Disclaimer done.Now, for the high praises!! YES, math is supposed to be FUN. It's about noticing, thinking, discovering, beauty, ""coincidences,"" patterns, sense, reasoning and FUN. I typed all sorts of quotes into the goodreads database (just check the right sidebar on this book's page, and you'll see a link to more quotes from this book).I was blessed, I suppose, to not only inherit nerdy genes, but critical-thinking genes; to have been exposed to puzzle-fun growing up; and to have had a great public school experience over-all; AND to have had a go-at-your-own-pace math curriculum in 5th grade, which was the highlight of every day. I didn't particularly enjoy timed multiplication tests in 3rd grade (I choke under pressure), and Linear Algebra kicked my fanny in college. But everything in between was fun! (Ok, I lied: Mrs. Oyamot used to mark off point for misspelled words on our Algebra tests, which I thought was a bit cranky.)The point being, Lockhart's Lament is preaching to the choir with me. I've always loved math. And I've always loved it because of the fun of exploring and discovering, and its beauty. I *got* that out of math class, even though it wasn't taught that way. Also, I'm on the educational fringe already. I homeschool and don't use curriculum; I'm so far away from being concerned with K-12 curriculum it isn't funny.*******From my notes: p46 ""Honest intellectual relationship"" caused me pause - I suppose because it looks so different depending on the setting and the age. And I take honesty for granted.p48 ""We lean things because they interest us now, not because they might be useful later..."" There's truth in that, and it's certainly more true for the young and the immature and some personalities. But I hope that if someone is becoming truly educated and not just ""taught"" they develop a desire to learn useful things. Of course, that's gradual.p49 [Large-digit addition is too advanced for most 3rd graders.... Wait until they're naturally curious about numbers.] I mostly agree with this; primarily because this is how I handled reading. I didn't push reading on my kids, rather I exposed them to lots of books, I modeled reading and I read TO them. Especially because math is so maligned in today's world, I think exposure to ""playing"" math is essential. If you wait until someone develops a natural curiosity without exposing them to said subject, it might never happen. Exposure in a playful, fun way is essential.p50 ""Preparing tomorrow's workforce today"" is such a sarcastic, loaded remark!!p52 He contrasts memorizing poetry (the ""awful"" way of teaching) to writing your own (the only ""good"" way), and I believe them to be points on a continuum. It's asking a lot for a child to write poetry without any exposure. Exposure, again, is key.p63 ""Cogs in a great soul-crushing machine"" rivals the oft-quoted Titanic reference in the beginning.p64 More staggering cruelty towards The System: ""The problem is not that the students can't handle it, it's that none of the teachers can.""p78-9 This pretty much epitomizes his criticism: ""The problem with the standard geometry [or any math] curriculum is that the private, personal experience of being a struggling artist has virtually been eliminated. The art of proof has been replaced by a rigid step-by-step pattern of uninspired formal deductions. The textbook presents a set of definitions, theorems, and proofs, the teacher copies then onto the blackboard, and the students copy them into their notebooks. They are then asked to mimic them in the exercises. Those that catch on to the pattern quickly are the ""good"" students.""The result is that the student becomes a passive participant in the creative act.... They are being trained to APE arguments, not to INTEND them. So not only do they have no idea what their teacher is saying, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE SAYING.""*******Part 2 of the book models a few instances of questioning and working for the answer. My favorite was the one about odd numbers and square numbers. I never knew that one! :) The second part of the book was a nice complement to the first, but simply reading the essay online certainly communicates the point.His detractors are fair when they say that he gives little concrete suggestions about how to *go about* teaching math without curriculum, but on the other hand, one of his main points is that you can't teach math if you don't love it. Your enthusiasm and guidance will facilitate math-learning, based on where your students are and your time together, etc. BUT, the world would certainly benefit from more ""this is what we did to explore math today"" ideas. Highly recommended if you think you're ""not good at math."" If you dislike math there's a good chance you don't understand what it is AT ALL.Happy mathing!(see also http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list...http://www.noetic-learning.com/gifted...http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Vi... especially ""doodling in math class"")"
4,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,This is brilliant! After reading this I finally remember what fascinated me about maths before I was trained to sit maths exams.The author's stunningly poethic approach to math as a study of world and its transcendent nature that is so eloquently explained in this work can make even the most antimathematically thinking person to fall in love with maths!A sure must reread.
5,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780231-tracy-black,1,"This was TERRIBLE. The first chapter began so well and had me so psyched about the book. Lockhart made an analogy between mathematics and music, where a musician wakes from a terrible dream in which public schools teach only the mechanics of music, but students are not allowed to compose or listen to music until college level. I thought it was a brilliant analogy. But it was downhill from there. His solution to the problem of math not being ""fun"" seemed to be to no longer teach the mechanics of math, but to just emphasize over and over that math is ""art"". I drug myself a quarter of the way through the book before giving up. I love math, but I have no clue what the hell he meant by ""art"". And I'm not sure how anyone who doesn't know the mechanics of math could ever make it to the fun part, which is solving puzzles. A good analogy for his method would be a French teacher who doesn't require that her students know any actual words in French, but instead tells her students over and over what a beautiful language it is. Can't be boring them with the ""mechanics"" ya know."
6,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861629-k,5,"Disclaimer 1) This is only a review of the 25 page essay, which can be found here: http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLa.... Why am I reviewing the essay instead of the book? Well, I don’t have the book, but I did read the essay and thought that posting a review of even part of it would be of worth to some poor, sad, math-challenged-but-don’t-know-why soul.Disclaimer2) I know next to nothing about mathematics, but am endeavoring to want to learn it. God bless you, Sally B., for sending me the link to this paper before I went out and bought a set of Saxon math! Okay, I admit it. I’m math-o-phobic. Always have been. What are you going to do? Bad teachers. Boring subject. No natural tendency nor talent. Can’t see the relevancy (what are calculators for, anyway?) I just plain don’t get it. I’m just not a math person, I guess. Does that sound familiar? Do you suffer too? Well, I think that some relief may lie herein. But seriously, this essay turned me on my head concerning all things mathematical. I have a 12 yo whom I have been feeling needs to “begin” learning math, he’s getting on in years, it’s time I suppose. I truly was all set to get down to the dirty business of it and buy him the Saxon books this year and then give him the “some things are just plain boring, hard, and hateful, and we have to do them anyway so we can someday get into college” lecture. It could work. Lucky for my kid. Lockhart saves the day (well, Sally saved the day really…). You must know that Lockhart’s essay is more a treatise on great, inspirational (and inspired) teaching than mathematics. It also happens to be very well-written and laugh-out-loud hilarious, which really helps, as the subject matter (that millions of souls have been damaged or destroyed by being “taught” the all-time worst of subjects, math) can get a little downheartening. Truly it is so. You don’t believe it? Give this little essay a try. Lockhart’s premise is this, if I can adequately sum up: Mathematics is the world’s oldest and most beautiful form of art. It is inspiring. It is gorgeous. It is simple. It is fun! Oh, except to everyone who has ever been taught it. I quote: “There is surely no more reliable way to kill enthusiasm and interest in a subject than to make it a mandatory part of the school curriculum.” The way we are taught math is as if we were mandatorily taught art by first learning theory and how to properly identify colors, mediums & utensils. Then if we’re lucky we can move on to “pre-paint-by-numbers” and then further on to real “paint-by-numbers.” And this is all without ever seeing a real work of art or hear a story of the life of a famous artist. If they are really good at that, and somehow still retain interest, maybe in college we’ll let them actually paint on a blank canvas and look at some art. (Lockhart’s analogy.)Lockhart says this is exactly how we teach mathematics. We’ve extracted all the miserably boring parts and shunted off all the beautiful parts, because, well, because it’s only the boring parts that can be adequately tested. HOLY BUCKETS!! You mean all the hell we all went through “learning” “math” was only a devilish device for testing? To see if we can follow directions? That is it?There were only two things I disagreed with in this essay (at this reading, anyway.) One was Lockhart’s assumption that math is beautiful because it is so totally irrelevant (just flights of fancy and such). I’m not sure I read it right, and I’m not sure that’s even what he meant. Assuming that he meant what I think he said, I disagree in that I think it is very probable that as there are mathematical patterns in every living thing, God knows pretty advanced mathematics and He used them for a purpose. I think it is highly applicable to have fun discovering that relevancy. Second, I disagree with this statement: “English teachers know that spelling and pronunciation are best learned in a context of reading and writing. History teachers know that names and dates are uninteresting when removed from the unfolding backstory of events.” So, if you get what I disagree with, sue me or wink too, whichever suits you best.Really, there’s too much to say about this essay. I’d end up regurgitating it all and I really think it would do EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. ON. THE. PLANET to give it a read. You don’t have to agree, but it’s worth a look. Sorry for the enthusiasm. But hey, it’s the first time EVER I’ve been enthusiastic about something mathematical. Let’s have a party.I’ll leave you with a little excerpt from one of the little delightful question and answer “dialogues” Lockhart intermingles within the essay. SIMPLICIO: But don’t we need people to learn those useful consequences of math? Don’t we need accountants and carpenters and such?SALVIATI: How many people actually use any of this “practical math” they supposedly learn in school? Do you think carpenters are out there using trigonometry? How many adults remember how to divide fractions, or solve a quadratic equation? Obviously the current practical training program isn’t working, and for good reason: it isexcruciatingly boring, and nobody ever uses it anyway. So why do people think it’s so important? I don’t see how it’s doing society any good to have its members walking around with vague memories of algebraic formulas and geometric diagrams, and clear memories of hating them. It might do some good, though, to show them something beautiful and give them an opportunity to enjoy being creative, flexible, open-minded thinkers— the kind of thing a real mathematical education might provide.SIMPLICIO: But people need to be able to balance their checkbooks, don’t they?SALVIATI: I’m sure most people use a calculator for everyday arithmetic. And why not? It’s certainly easier and more reliable. But my point is not just that the current system is so terribly bad, it’s that what it’s missing is so wonderfully good! Mathematics should be taught as art for art’s sake. These mundane “useful” aspects would follow naturally as a trivial by-product. Beethoven could easily write an advertising jingle, but his motivation for learning music was to create something beautiful.SIMPLICIO: But not everyone is cut out to be an artist. What about the kids who aren’t “math people?” How would they fit into your scheme?SALVIATI: If everyone were exposed to mathematics in its natural state, with all the challenging fun and surprises that that entails, I think we would see a dramatic change both in the attitude of students toward mathematics, and in our conception of what it means to be “good at math.” We are losing so many potentially gifted mathematicians— creative, intelligent people who rightly reject what appears to be a meaningless and sterile subject. They are simply too smart to waste their time on such piffle.SIMPLICIO: But don’t you think that if math class were made more like art class that a lot of kids just wouldn’t learn anything?SALVIATI: They’re not learning anything now! Better to not have math classes at all than to do what is currently being done. At least some people might have a chance to discover something beautiful on their own.SIMPLICIO: So you would remove mathematics from the school curriculum?SALVIATI: The mathematics has already been removed! The only question is what to do with the vapid, hollow shell that remains. Of course I would prefer to replace it with an active and joyful engagement with mathematical ideas.SIMPLICIO: But how many math teachers know enough about their subjects to teach it that way?SALVIATI: Very few. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg…. Heck, someday, if I go about it right, I may even end up as math nerdy as Sally. But I’m not sure I can ever get to that level of cool. --P.S. Per reading some of the unfavorable reviews here on goodreads. Sure it is true that Lockhart does not offer many solutions to his problems. However, we live in an age where we always WANT other people to do the work and give us the solutions. I think half the fun of this journey (and definitely ALL of the reward) will be in finding our own way. I am so grateful for the freedom & opportunity & drive to educate my kids the way I see fit. ---To Sally: Perhaps I ought to have found more to disagree with…but maybe that will come as I actually learn what math can and should be. I’ll have to reread it a year or so from now. For now, it was like lightning. And I can hardly wait to talk to you more about the whole subject. You are my self-chosen mathematics mentor, should you yourself choose to be appointed. With humble, yet enthused, gratitude; Krislyn"
7,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286876-nick,5,"Slightly expanded from the essay online (pdf) in that it has a Part II: Exultation where Lockhart wants to ""tell you more about what math really is and why I love it so much."" (p.92).Seriously, this is a great essay/book. Worth reading probably once a semester, if not more. And before structuring a class (curriculum). The faux dialog at the end of every section is awesome, and indicates good ways to respond to nay-sayers (are there any?), even if not all of the questions/concerns are fully addressed.When in doubt, remember that math is an art. Argue for it as you might for music or painting. Of course, to a Platoist, math is discovered, instead of created, like I think of for music or painting. But there's some famous sculptor who said something about freeing a form from the marble, instead of making it, right?Part I: Lamentationp.23:... there is nothing as dreamy and poetic, nothing as radical, subversive, and psychedelic, as mathematics. It is every bit as mind-blowing as cosmology or physics..., and allows more freedom of expression than poetry, art, or music.... Mathematics is the purest of the arts, as well as the most misunderstood.p.24: ""If there is anything like a unifying aesthetic principle in mathematics, it is this: simple is beautiful. Mathematicians enjoy thinking about the simplest possible things, and the simplest possible things are imaginary.""p.25: ""... major theme in mathematics: things are what you want them to be."" and later ""This is the amazing thing about making imaginary patterns: they talk back!""p.27: ""Somehow, I was able to create a profound simple beauty out of nothing, and change myself in the process. Isn't that what art is all about?""p.29: ""Mathematics is the art of explanation.""p.32-33: ""gross misconception that mathematics is somehow useful to society!"" later: ""Music can lead armies into battle, but that's not why people write symphonies.""p.37: ""The mathematics curriculum... needs to be scrapped."" later: ""Mathematics is the music of reason."" later still: ""you gave it sense and you still don't understand what your creation is up to"" within ""To do mathematics is... to be alive, damn it.""p.39: ""We don't need to bend over backwards to give mathematics relevance. It has relevance in the same way that any art does: that of being a meaningful human experience.""p.43 (emphasis mine):So how do we teach our students to do mathematics? By choosing engaging and natural problems suitable to their tastes, personalities, and levels of experience. By giving them time to make discoveries and formulate conjectures. By helping them to refine their arguments and creating an atmosphere of healthy and vibrant mathematical criticism. By being flexible and open to sudden changes in direction to which their curiosity may lead.

He has some interesting points. He says that true mathematics is an art form and has no practical purpose other than to bring joy to those who practice it. It should be taught as an art form just for the sake of enjoying its true beauty, just like we would study great literature, art, or music. As a Charlotte Mason-inspired educator, I am intrigued. Miss Mason believed in a “liberal education for all,” and did not think all learning had to be related to preparing for a particular trade. But I digress. The first part of the book is a mouthy rant against the current system and the second part is an introduction to “true mathematics,” namely, problem solving. Figuring out how numbers work together, how patterns work, how lines relate to each other in space, etc. What is sorely lacking is any kind of practical description of how a person would lead a child in practicing “real mathematics.” Perhaps he would say I am missing the point."

if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child’s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn’t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done— I simply wouldn’t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soul-crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education. Everyone knows that something is wrong. The politicians say, “we need higher standards.” The schools say, “we need more money and equipment.” Educators say one thing, and teachers say another. They are all wrong. The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, “math class is stupid and boring,” and they're right...

This will be more palpable to a wider audience than Hardy's ""Apology"" but it is no less opinionated. Not having any real relation to the US math curriculum, I read this for the opinions and the math, which were both fantastic. The only thing I have against it is that it ended too quickly. The conversational approach towards proofs was most invigorating."
11,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249346-phil,5,"This book is fantastic. I recommend it to all those people who, upon hearing from me that I do math, have replied, ""Oh, I suck at math"" or ""Oh, I always hated math in school."" For years I've encountered a recurring frustration at the fact that, when I tell people that I'm studying mathematics, I tend to discover that they have a completely wrong impression of what it is that I do (or at least try to do), and that it is not easy to correct this impression. I try to tell them: you hate math because you don't know what it is, because the stuff they taught you in school was not math, but almost something else entirely; real math is fun and interesting and makes you think both logically and imaginatively, it is both beautiful and surprising. But I never quite feel like I get the whole truth across.This book gets the whole truth across. It says everything I've ever wanted to say (as well as many things I hadn't thought of) in regards to all of this, but does a much better job than I ever could. He accurately portrays exactly how it is that people commonly misunderstand what mathematicians really do, the common misperceptions that they tend to have. Then he goes on to critique what is pretty obviously at the root of all this misunderstanding: the state of math education itself. Through a few clever analogies and a bit of simple explanation, the author demonstrates how the average student's assessment of the 'mathematics' that we are taught in school is completely accurate: namely, that it is arbitrary, stupid, and boring. He clearly and succinctly articulates the tragedy of the current state of the public math education system, and how it poisons the general public's understanding of what mathematics is, and never even comes close to giving the general public a real sense of what the subject is even about. He gleefully and accurately (and also quite humorously) tears to shreds the current K-12 curriculum, exposing it's idiocy.But the book doesn't stop there; after showing us what is wrong with the current state of mathematics education, he goes on to give a brief and wonderful little demonstration, through several very accessible examples, of what mathematics really is, the types of things that mathematicians actually think about, and why they are interesting. I found this to be wonderful-the best part of the book. The whole book is also superbly written; his choice of words had me laughing out loud at times.Finally, reading this book actually made me feel somewhat ashamed of my sometimes aloof personal attitude towards my area of study; my tendency to think of my subject as something intractably esoteric and advanced, inaccessible to the general public (because, of course, only the intellectual elite such as myself are capable of comprehending it). At one point he makes note of the fact that many people make it most of the way through most of graduate school believing (because they've always been told) that they are good at math, only to discover, when they attempt to do some real mathematics, that all they were really good at is following directions. Ouch. I hope that isn't me...So again, I recommend this book to all my friends and family who wonder what it is that I'm trying to do, and I may even be buying it for some of you, come Christmas time!"
12,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1406377-scott,5,"An excellent book that lays out a strong case that schools fail - yet again - at a task at which it is meant to be good. Teaching math is the target, but the same arguments could certainly be applied to any number of areas of study. For instance, as a social studies teacher charged with leading my students through various curriculums, I feel the awful pull of those vocab terms, those textbook pages etc. The best thing for a history student is to practice being a historian, and I do my best to both replicate that experience as well as follow the curriculum.For the most part I agree with, sympathize, and understand the ""lamentation"" portion of this two-part book. I did find it a bit heavy-handed and repetitive, which is to be expected for a fierce defense of artistic and academic freedom, but the dialogues, the examples, the chummy frustrated-friend-at-the-bar-letting-all-his-frustrations-out tone were all very well done; this was a readable, eye-opening book (especially so, probably, for non-teachers).In parallel (intersecting at a point an infinite distance away, of course) to the lament in this book, I taught a global history course this past year where I left the content open for the students - beyond assigning a few cool books meant to alter their perception of western history by substituting it with non-western and non-traditional perspectives - I focused on bolstering the critical skills of history and social sciences. It was harder for us all than I had expected, namely because when students were faced with content and current issues (we did quite a bit with the underlying history of modern issues) that they selected, they freaked. It was as if they couldn't handle that autonomous, authentic inquiry. They were already stuck in the vortex of teachers telling them what to do and just doing it mindlessly. Such is school, and this book illuminates that quite nicely.Thanks to Niles and Andrew for recommending this to me. Sorry it took so long for me to finally get to it!"

In this tiny book, Lockhart makes a compelling case for transforming the way math is taught in the United States, demonstrating that mathematics is an incredibly fun, artistic, and intellectually stimulating endeavor that is merely viewed as boring and practical because of the distorted way it is taught in schools.Lockhart is not very practicality-oriented, which makes sense for a mathematician, and at times this made his writing less convincing. I strongly disagree with his idea that teachers don't need training on how to teach math or that they don't need to plan anything—teaching math the way he wants would be very different from how people normally think of teaching, and thus would certainly require a fair amount of retraining (see Jo Boaler's books for implementation strategies). Furthermore, scaffolding mathematical exploration to maximize learning does require a lot of thought and planning.I also found that Lockhart has the same frustrating dismissiveness of practicality that I often see among humanities professors and students. I love his passion for mathematics as a pure intellectual pursuit, and I admire him for unabashedly supporting that, but I worry that he undermines his effectiveness by his frequent assertions that he does not care if math is in any way useful or practical. I think for parents, teachers, and policymakers to agree to changes in math education, it's important to note that even when mathematics is being studied purely for its own sake, that study has many incredibly useful byproducts.Despite these qualms, I think this is an insightful, convincing, and (perhaps most importantly) concise essay on the wonders of mathematics and the necessary changes for how it is taught."

That's what I'm saying. In particular, pure mathematics (by which I mean the fine art of mathematical proof) has absolutely no practical or economic value whatsoever. You see, practical things don't require explanation. Either they work or they don't.[...]Anyway, the point is not whether mathematics has any practical value-I don't care if it does or not. All I'm saying is that we don't need to justify it on that basis. We're talking about a perfectly innocent and delightful activity of the human mind-a dialogue with one's own mentality. Math requires no pathetic industrial or technological excuses. It transcends all of those mundane considerations. The value of mathematics is that it is fun and amazing and brings us great joy.""Un libro excelente, de lectura necesaria. No fue revelador, porque siempre pensé que la matemática es un arte, un juego que a veces tiene aplicaciones en ""el mundo real"".

Lockhart's criticism is certainly exaggerated, but I knew from the beginning that in his heart he was right. The best parts of his book were not dedicated to the educational system but to his love for Mathematics. And though he only gave some examples I knew what he meant. I was sitting on the shore of the Maltese Meditaranian ocean and I needed four beers to understand his (geometrical) ""proof for the fact, that the sum of all uneven numbers always give a square numer"". With his L-shaped examples he convinced me, but I could not rest before I had the ""arithmetical approach as well"". That took some other bottels of CISK (Maltese Beer). Sorry that I am not able to convey it in English, but everyone who likes numbers will understand me anyway. (n – 1)(n + 1) + 1 = n²Das ist die Formel, mit der sich beweisen lässt, dass die Summe aller ungeraden Zahlen immer eine Quadratzahl ergibt.

Like most rants, it starts off with some reasonable points/objections and is amusing to listen to at first ... and then, like most rants, it veers right off the road, through the fence, and ends up upside down in a pond with a nearby cow just staring at the wreckage, slowly chewing its cud. I have no objection to the claim(s) that the way math is taught today is illogical and stultifying. But the notions that math is an ""art"" and that is was created by humans for their own amusement are absurd. You know, pottery and weaving can both produce artistic end-products but the notion that they were created just for amusement would also be dismissed as ridiculous... The author also veers off into some rather unproductive and uncalled-for attacks on teachers themselves. While the institutional approach to math education may be lousy and many math teachers may not be the inspired math-artisans that the author wants them to be, I know too many of them who work too hard to do the best they can to accept his attacks as valid.

This book is a brilliant, passionate, sometimes over the top, treatise by a teacher and mathematician about the beauty of math, and how our schools and teachers, and society are screwing it up. He sometimes takes it too far - and I absolutely love his passion and writing style.

I fell in love. Proofs were fun, I was good at it, and the act of reasoning through those problems was a creative endeavor that provided the same high as writing a great short story or haiku. How come none of this came up when talking to my high school math teachers? Why was I always the kid who was ""no good at math"", or couldn't ""apply himself"" to getting a good grade in Algebra? The 20 year old me, who ended up with more math credits than anything else, blamed terrible teachers. Paul Lockhart's book is a better explanation.Far and away, the best thing I've read in a very long time, Lockhart's Lament & Exultation strips down math to it's barest form. Math is thinking about extremely cool things, for no other reason than it is fun. The fact that our current educational system hides this under a facade of standardized notation, and international competition is the problem, not the woeful cliche of entitled American students (and teachers).I'm not an educator, and I don't know if what he prescribes as a solution for math education is in fact workable. What I do know is, my best days involve working on abstract ""math"" problems, simply because they are there and chasing those problems has led to a fulfilling career, not the inverse.

This book is an ode to a lovely and deep art form that doesn't receive the love and respect it deserves. I had (for the most part) quite good math teachers in my public school education. Nevertheless, until I took a proof-based college-level math class, there was never much emphasis on working out problems (ie. proofs) in a creative way, or of discovering any intuitions regarding math. It doesn't really matter if a person can solve trigonometric functions (for the majority of people), and it doesn't matter how good you are at calculus (unless you are a physicist or engineer). But wouldn't it be nice if more people understood the beauty of logic and pure thought? I myself am a scientist, and nothing is more frustrating than people always asking ""What's the application?"" or ""How is this useful?""

To help your students memorize formula for the area and circumference of a circle, for example, you might invent a whole story about Mr. C, who drive around Mrs. A and tell her how nice his two pies are , and how her pies are square or some nonsense. But what about the real story? The one about mankind's struggle with problem of measuring curves; about Eudoxus and Archimedes and method of exhaustion; about the transcendent of Pi....p44 It is far easier to be a passive conduit of some publisher's ""materials"" and to follow the shampoo-bottle instruction-lecture,test-repeat- than to think deeply and thoughtfully about the meaning of one's subject and how best to convey that meaning directly and honestly to one's students. We are encouraged to forego the difficult task of making decision based on our individual wisdom and conscience.p46. Teaching is not about information. It is about having an honest intellectual relationship with your students. It requires no method, no tools, and no training. Just the ability to be real. ... In particular, you can't teach teaching. School of education are a complete crock..... Teaching means openness and honesty, an ability to share excitement, and a love of learning . Without these, all the education in the world won't help you, and with them they are completely unnecessary.p48. Just because a subject happens to have some mundane practical use does not mean that we have to make the use the focus of teaching and leaning. It may be true that you have to be be able to read in order to fill out forms at DMV, but that's not why we teach children to read. We teach them to for the higher purpose of allowing them access to beautiful and meaning ideas. Not only it would be cruel to teaching reading in such a way - to force third-graders to fill out purchase orders and tax forms - it would not work. We learn things because they interest us now, not because they might be useful later. But this is exactly what we are asking children to do with math.p48. Simplicio: But don't we need third-grades to be able to do arithmetic?Salviati: Why? You want to train them calculate 427 plus 389? It's just not a question that very many eight-year-olds are asking. For that matter, most adults don't fully understand decimal place-value arithmetic, and you expect third-grades to have a clean conception... It is simply too early for that kind of technical training. of course it can be done, but I think it ultimately does more harm than good. Much better to wait until their own natural curiosity about numbers kicks in.p49 Simplicio: Then what should do with young children in math class?Salviati: Play games! Teach them chess and  Go, Hex, and backgammon,Sprouts and nim, whatever. Make up a game. Do puzzles. Expose them to situations where deductive reasoning is necessary.p50. Salviati:I think the greater risk is that of creating schools devoid of creative expression of any kind, where the function of the students is to memorize dates, formulas, and vocabulary lists, and then regurgitate them on standardized tests- preparing tomorrow's workforce today!Salviati：....You learn things by doing them and you remember what matters to you. We have millions of adults wandering around with ""negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a"" in their heads, and absolutely no idea where whatsoever what it means.p56. The most striking thing about this so-called mathematics curriculum is its rigidity.... the exact same things are being said and done in the exact same way in exact same order... most people have simple accepted this standard model math curriculum as being synonymous with math itself.This is intimately connected to what I called ""ladder myth""- the idea that mathematics can be arranged as a sequence of ""subjects"" each being in some way more advanced, or ""higher, "" than previous. This effect is to make school mathematics into a race- some students are ""ahead"" of others, and parents worry that their child is ""falling behind""....In the end you've been cheated out a mathematical education, and you don't even know it.Real mathematics doesn't come in a can-there is no such thing as Algebra II idea. Problem lead to where they take you. Art is not race. The ladder myth is a false image of the subject, and a teacher's own path through standard curriculum reinforces this myth and prevents him or her from seeing mathematics as an organic whole. As a result, we have a math curriculum with no historical perspective or thematic coherence, a fragmented collection of assorted topics and techniques, united only be the ease with which they can be reduced to step-by-step procedure.In place of discovery and exploration, we have rules and regulation.....In place of meaningful problems, which might lead to a synthesis of diverse ideas, to uncharted territories of discussion and debate, and to a feeling of thematic unity and harmony in mathematics, we have instead joyless and redundant exercises,specific to the technique under discussion, and so disconnected from each other and from mathematics as a whole that neither the students or their teacher have foggiest idea how or why such a thing might come up in the first place.p66 Exploring the not-at-all obvious fact that five groups of seven is the same as seven groups of five.p82 Simplicio: But then how can school guarantee that their students will all have same basic knowledge? How will we accurately measure their relative worth?Salviati: They can't, and we won't. Just like in real life. Ultimately you have to face the fact that people are different, and that's just fine. In any case, there's no urgency. .... At least that person would come away with some sort of an idea of what subject is really about, and would get to see something beautiful.p78.The textbook presents a set of definition, theorems,and proofs, the teacher copies them onto blackboard, and students copy them into their notebooks.They are then asked to mimic them in exercises. Those that catch on to the pattern quickly are the ""good"" students.p83 The standard school mathematics curriculum Lower school math. The indoctrination begins. Students learn that mathematics is not something you do, but something that is done to you. Emphasis is placed on sitting still, filling out worksheets, and following directions. Children are expected to master a complex set of algorithms for manipulating Hindu-Arabic symbols, unrelated to any real desire or curiosity on their part, and regarded only a few centuries ago a too difficult for the average adult. Multiplication tables are stressed, as are parents, teachers, and the kid themselves.Middle School Math. Students are taught to view mathematics as a set of procedures, akin to religious rites, which are eternal and set in stone. They holy tablets, or Math books, are handed out, and students learn to address church elders as ""they."" (As in ""What do they want here? Do they want me to divide?) Contrived and artificial ""word problems"" will be introduced in order to make the mindless drudgery of arithmetic seem enjoyable by comparison. Students will be tested on a wide array of unnecessary technical terms, such as ""whole number"" and 'proper fraction', without the slightest rationale for making such distinction. Excellent preparation for Algebra I. -- my comment, What is math (my note)p92 Mathematical Reality. This is of course of imaginary place, a landscape of elegant, fanciful structures, inhabited by wonderful, imaginary creature who engaged in all sorts of fascinating and curious behaviors.p95 To me the important step is not the move from rocks to symbols, it's transition from quantity to entity- the conception of five and seven not as amounts of something but as beings, like hamsters, which have features and behavior.p100 Mathematical Reality, because it is an imaginary place, I actually can have pretty much whatever I want.p105 So the mathematical landscape filled with these interesting and delightful structures that we have built (or accidentally discovered) for our own amusement. We observe them, notice interesting pattern, and try to craft elegant and compelling narratives to explain their behavoir.At least that's what I do. There certainly are people out there whose approach is quite different- practical-minded people who seek mathematical models of reality to help them predication or to improve some aspect of the human conditions (or at least improve the balance sheet of their corporate sponsors). Well, I'm not one of those people, The only thing I ma interested in using mathematics for is to have a good time and to help others do the same...... I don't know about you, but I'm here to have fun. p108 This is the Frankenstein aspect of mathematics-we have authority to define our creations, to instil in them whatever features or properties we choose, but we have no say in what behaviors may then ensue as a consequence of our choices.p110. Math is not about a collection of ""truths"" (however useful or interesting they may be). Math is about reason and understanding. We want to know why. And not for any practical purpose.Here 's where the art has to happen. Observation and discovery are one thing, but explanation is quite another. What we need a proof, a narrative of some kind that helps us to understand why this pattern is occurring . ... A mathematical proof should be an absolutely clean logical dedication... needs not only to satisfy, but to satisfy beautifully. This is goal of the mathematician: to explain in simplest, most elegant and logically satisfying way possible. To make the mystery melt away to reveal a simple crystalline truth.P112. Not this it's so easy to get any proof off the ground. Most of us are so frustrated with our problems that we could gladly settle for the ugliest and clunkiest of arguments. At least we would then be sure that our conjecture is right and there won't be any counterexamples. But is is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and it cannot last. As hardy says, ""there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics."" History shows that eventually someone will surely uncover the real proof, the one that conveys not just a message, but a revelation. --- my comment: what is called the true poof?p118 Notice that once we know why something is true, then in particular we know that it is true.p120 Now hold a minutes, Paul. Are you telling me that mathematics is nothing more than exercise in mental masturbation? Making up imaginary patterns ans structures for the hell of it and then investigating them and try to devise pretty explanations for their behavior, all for the sake of some sort of rarified intellectual aesthetic?Yep. That's what I'm saying. In particular, pure mathematics(by which I mean the fine art of mathematical proof) has absolutely no practical or economic vale whatsoever. You see, practical things don’t' require explanation.....We're talking about a perfect innocent and delightful activity of the human mind- a dialogue with one's own mentality. Math require no pathetic industrial or technological excuses. It transcends all of those mundane consideration. The value of mathematics is that it is fun and amazing and brings us great joy. p138 Children understand this. They know that learning and playing are the same thing. How sad that grown-ups are forgotten. They think of learning as a chore, so they make it into one. Their problem is intentionality.So let me leave with the only practical advice I have to offer: just play! You don't need a license to do math. You don't need to take a class or read a book. Mathematical Reality is yours to enjoy for the rest of your life. It exists in your imagination and you can do whatever you want with it. Including nothing, of course.p140 And if you are a math teacher, then you especially need to be playing around in Mathematical Reality. Your teaching should flow naturally from your experience in the jungle, not from some fake tourist version with a car on tracks and windows rolled up. I hope I have managed to give you glimpse of something beautiful and pure, a harmless and joyful activity that has bought untold delight to many people for thousand of years.Links:Devlin's Angle http://devlinsangle.blogspot.comMAA: The Mathematical Association of America http://www.maa.org "
34,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25334857-shay,2,"*I read this for my math class and this is what I wrote in response:Here I was thinking this book was going to be some boring math book. Boy, was I wrong! I very much enjoyed this delightful book. I was more enraptured as each page just rolled by in a blur. Occasionally, two people talked back and forth with one asking questions and the other answering. This was surprisingly helpful and I found myself asking these exact same questions before they came up in the conversation. The theme of this book is that students-people-should be able to play with math on their own without too much instruction. Use your imagination and make something new to put out in the world. Schools have burned the freedom out of kids. They do not allow a certain amount of playfulness into the classroom of math, or any subject for that matter. Minds are made numb in this current school system.The book kicked off with a musician’s nightmare, narrating it as if it was really happening in the waking world. In the dream, everyone was required to do music, no matter where they came from and if they wanted to do it or not. This is a nightmare of a musician because it begs the question: If everyone is forced to do music, what’s so special about it? Across town, an artist has a similar nightmare: students don’t learn how to paint on a canvas until very late in their careers. Educators had the thought that they needed to learn everything about art before they painted so they could better understand it. Mathematicians have the same nightmare, but it’s an actual waking nightmare. Every single school has the teachers introducing math the exact same way because it’s the way they’ve all learned. The curriculum hasn’t changed for a few centuries and there doesn’t seem to be an end to this way of things. Math is a part of the Arts. It’s beautiful, full of possibility and new life. For example, we should be able to take a rectangle and imagine another shape inside of it. Help it to become something...more. Look at something and see another thing. Math is that subject that seems to be the most confusing to a lot of people. They don’t understand it as it should be understood. We do the math problems, but do we really understand it? I don’t think so. Teachers give the students a bunch of math problems and tell them to do it, but they’re not learning a scrap of what is out there. Math is someone doodling all over the back of their assignment. Doodles turn into math and that turns into a thing that can be molded into something amazing. It’s simply easy and schools tend to make it more complicated; math is a simple thing. Page 26 talks about asking questions. A drawing of a rectangle with a triangle drawn inside of it must be measured. How can we tell how big this triangle is and how much space it takes up? Well, let us draw a line down the middle of it. Here’s the question: What made me draw that line? I saw a gamble and took it. Making mistake after mistake is how those Great mathematicians, artists, and musicians become famously smart. The line that was drawn-that was a little detail that made all the difference. Take an image-a math problem-and draw something to add those details that can change your whole outlook. Appreciate what is in front of you, see something beneath the surface. Teachers make the kids memorize an absurd amount of content without really understanding what any of it means because they’re so busy memorizing it. I love this book and would recommend it to any one person. It’s for everyone, but especially educators. We, as educators, are the manipulators of the arts in universal form. Page 30 has us telling ourselves to drill our own way. Don’t sit back and take what your teachers throw at you. Page 31 tells us about society and math. Teachers are so busy trying so hard to incorporate real life scenarios into their lessons. What does math have to do with anything I’m going to be doing? Sometimes, it seems like they’re trying too hard because the math they teach in schools doesn’t have much to do with real life situations; memorize formulas and do the assignments. Math is just fun and logical, not needing any explanation. Who remembers anything they learned in math class? Not very many. Page 36: There’s no better way to make passion disappear than to make certain classes a requirement. Find a way to teach the kids so they can understand. Take their interests and use those to shape the student. Be that teacher who can listen with an open mind. Start small and go from there. There is an order to learning that is imperative to follow. Although, kids can do anything they set their minds to without the faintest idea of the specifics. Try not teaching them and tell them to come up with their own problems to fix; build your own mind. Page 73 gives us an example of a circle with a triangle in the middle. Circles are curious things. If a triangle is in the middle of a circle, it’s always a right angle no matter which way it rotates. How do we know this? We use imagination and see the triangle/circle rotating, pictures are drawn. We take something bland and turn it into something to be considered, a thing that is beautiful. This book was useful to me because it opened my mind to new possibilities: methods are not useful in the slightest-they’re restricting. We are comfortable learning the way we do in schools because that’s how we’ve done it our whole lives. It’s the same with teaching. We learn from teachers who have been teaching for years, but they are so stuck in old ways that you are liable to fall into the same hole. We get so used to math problems being too hard for us that when we see an easy problem, we look at it from every possible angle. The same goes for any other subject. My vision has broadened into a hard, tangible monster. I was soft and now my mold is a little more stable. I now know that I can do so much more with math than I once thought. Math is like English. It’s poetry, art, and so much more. My favorite parts in this book are those of wisdom, which was the whole book. I will keep this book as a reference in the future and I will recommend it to educators. It’s the type of book that I can’t imagine not reading and gaining something different from it every time I pick it up."

It can be found in PDF all over the internet (like here).I honestly do not know how to begin describing this ""lament"". How true it is, how accurate, how important! I believe important is simply an understatement. Every single person should read this piece of writing, whether they are directly involved in mathematics or not. The school system followed in most of the world, in which ""mathematics"" is simply a set of formulas and archaic hieroglyphs that most students don't understand, and I would dare say most of their ""teachers"" don't either, is not mathematics AT ALL! No wonder most students end up hating math, for why would anyone love something so utterly dry and incomprehensible? How can someone love something that is only made for those who are ""math people""? And what if you're not a ""math person""? Well let me tell you something, echoing the author, there is no such thing as a math person and this form of bullying at schools should end. Let me also tell you something, again echoing the author, that what is being taught in most school systems around the world is not mathematics: it simply is mutated sickly ape of what mathematics is. Mathematics is art!. Mathematics is the art of reasoning, of thinking logically, of creating. How beautiful is that! But is any of this being taught at schools? Sadly, no. What ""mathematics"" has been reduced to is a set of dry disgusting formulas. How many talents have been destroyed by this system? How many great potential mathematicians have been obliterated before they even reached teenage, simply because they were told that they are not a math person? How many more will be destroyed, before anything changes? What an immense sin it is to destroy the talents of young people!Now, I'm sorry for writing such a heated piece above. But I guess anyone would get angry when they can see the beauty of a certain art, but the system is methodically destroying it. I would also like to point out, that it is not the teachers' fault at all (in most cases), for both the innocent students and the innocent teachers are being compromised in this system. A must-read.5 / 5."
36,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4812558-brian-koser,4,"I read Lockhart's Lament 10 years ago; this was my first time reading the expanded book form.Unless you're looking for a short book to jumpstart an ambitious reading goal, stick with the original essay. The book additions are good but not essential.Lockhart's thesis is that math is an art, not a science. Math sometimes has real-life applications, but it's beauty is that it is not, on the whole, practical. Modern American math education is boring, soulless, and unhelpful. Geometry is the worst. We give students principles devoid of history or context and make them practice repetitively; instead we should guide them to discovering the principles. If we taught music like we teach math, we'd stress that students must learn musical notation and how to transpose key signatures, but not let them listen to music or compose. Our curriculums, the concept of curriculums, lesson plans, word problems, math tests, and education degrees are also bad. We would never have painting teachers that don't paint, but most math teachers don't do math. The best way to teach math is to let the student play around with math, giving them puzzles, teaching them chess and Go, and letting them prove concepts without worrying about the correct terms and forms.I think he is right, mostly. I certainly skipped lots of math in grade school (I bet you're underestimating how much; if you homeschool, make sure to check your kid's work at least a couple of times a year) because it was boring. A college math professor that let us ""play around"" with things like encryption algorithms for a semester made me love math.On the other hand, we do live in a world where standardized tests matter (at least a little). Math has developed from practical uses (accounting, computer science, etc.) Curriculums and lesson plans are useful, and teachers need some sort of training.Anyway, the essay and now the book has me considering if I want to just get a standard math curriculum for our kids. Maybe I can find one that incorporates the idea of the student discovering with intuition and experimentation. If we do go with a standard approach, I'll reduce repetitive work as much as possible and add puzzles and games in their place."
37,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115047625-emily,5,"Anyone who reads this expecting a well-detailed game plan to revolutionize math teaching across the nation will probably be very disappointed. But for those just beginning to think about education or looking for a new perspective might react like me, with very energetic appreciation. Lockhart does an amazing job at getting to what he views as the root of the tragedy, doing a fair job of addressing counterarguments along the way. I'll first address one of the main criticisms: that Lockhart is overly artistic, and discounts the very useful applications of mathematics that students will need to study engineering, economics, etc. To that I say: he doesn't say to NOT teach techniques - simply teach them in context of interesting problems and their origins. A student who has the habit of thinking deeply about math problems will have no problem picking up whatever algorithms they need in college math classes. In fact, by pursuing understanding of the problems they encounter, they may do even better (and certainly enjoy more) than their methodically drilled peers.I went through grade school years after he published this, and the experience was pretty much just as he described. What Lockhart says is wrong with math education is wrong with pretty much all grade school education in general. It's boring and rote, good teachers are the rare exception, and students learn next to nothing. And as he predicted, my best math teacher had a solid university mathematics background.The education system really is tragic. It teaches kids that to succeed they need to play the game and be people-pleasers. They need to mold their minds to recognize the right bubble to fill. I succeeded conventionally, but I despised the process.Now in university, many of my peers who study math express that they had no idea whatsoever that all these wonderful and interesting fields even existed before. This book (long essay, really) has motivated me to look at math with fresh eyes. And even more than before I hope to help bring about some improvement in education."
38,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,3,"This was a polemic on the modern method in which math is taught within the united states education system.* The central contention is that kids (k-12, and kinda college) are taught a dry system of boring mechanical seemingly arbitrary means of mindless rote. The author is saddened by this. This is because in his eyes this method of teaching sucks math dry of its place as a profound study of patterns and structure -with deep philosophical ties. Math is, in the author’s view, a beautiful mysterious art which stirs the souls of anyone that truly engages with it. He asserts that the education system fails students by instead or allowing them to engage with the profundity of the ideas as individual curious minds, they are forced to bore themselves in ways that doesn’t truly allow them to do math. As a mathematician who sees math as an art form like music or painting, he is deeply insulted by the state of education and demands us to change it.This line of argumentation, which is, in short that many of our education systems in the western world stifle intelligence is .WellQuite worn out.There have been out spoken critics such as john gatto, or more famously , ken Wilbur that pretty much have the same view. For them though, the issue is much more expansive than math. While I certainly agree with many of the ideas in this book, and even find the enthusiasm for math quite resonant, I cant quite help but think the author is unaware of how pervasive this issue is.He is correct to defend the beauty of math. This subject called by some ‘the queen of the sciences’. I will admit though this is not a very profound text, but perhaps it is useful as a small book to recommend to a teacher here and there.Recommended:For a teacher here and there Those angry about the state of math in americaThose that suspect children are not optimizing on their creative abilities within the modern education system *and possibly other nations"

While I agree with him that the current state of mathematic in schools and unis is a travesty, the kind of ""solution"" he's recommending is not the real solution. We all know what most of us thought about the math (and many other fields) in ES and HS, and leaving it all to the student is not an excellent solution.""Mathematics is the art of explanation. If you deny students the opportunity to engage in this activity - to pose their own problems, to make their own conjectures and discoveries, to be wrong, to be creatively frustrated, to have an inspiration, and to cobble together their own explanations and proofs - you deny them mathematics itself.""I think his argument - that mathematics education gets tripped up in unnecessary formalism and syntax before conceptually interesting problems are tackled, and that the whole thing is defended with the ridiculous ""you might need this someday"" pragmatism that children will instantly tune out - is a sound one. It would be great if every elementary school teacher were the kind of engaged leader capable of putting his or her students to work on an interesting geometry or abstract algebra problem and wandering around not to give answers, but to provide the occasional hint. Unfortunately, I don't see how this is going to provide anyone with well-rounded mathematics education.---Don't get me wrong! I liked the premise of his essay. I would love that my professors had just a pinch of Lockhart's teaching spirit; it would make studying math much enjoyable. But, while I can see how it would make learning math so much more fun, it isn't practical. I think it could be accomplished in a small setting, but let's face it, the world doesn't allow for exploration. You have to master what they want you to master troubling as that may be."
40,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84019683-jose,4,"A true albeit crude description of what school has done to mathematics. As a high school senior myself, I think I have gone through all of the stages Lockhart mentions and have personally seen what school math has done to most of my classmates. I am fortunate to have stumbled real math and its full beauty from one enthusiastic teacher, an at the time high school senior who had stumbled upon real math from yet another classmate. I passed on this confidential secret to yet another classmate, with hopes that he manages to give it to yet another one.Despite this chain of secrets however, it's really sad to think that it has to stay at this- a secret. By now everyone hates math so much that doing so much as talking about it would be effectively shooting yourself in your foot, socially speaking at least. Apart from all the reasons Lockhart mentions in his essay, I think that this is also an important factor that contributes to the beauty of math being stripped away. I'm sure many mathematicians would agree that some of the best mathematical work and some of the best memories are formed when discussing a beautiful new proof in a napkin with some fellow math enthusiasts. School also strips us away from this opportunity when there are rarely any actual social opportunities to discuss math.Overall I liked the tone of the author, and I will definitely try to introduce this to my math teachers, with the hope that they can show it to the administration and maybe, just maybe, save the generation who is currently stepping into first grade and is about to get what's supposed to be a beautiful and fantastic journey completely ruined."
41,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28281568-anda-p,4,"Some interesting thoughts in this book. I like the idea of my kids doing math by trying to puzzle through things. This will hopefully show them what math is really like and how satisfying the discovery of a good proof to a tricky question is. It will also hopefully remain with them longer and train their powers of logic.However, I also see the value of repetition and math WORK. It is rather shameful that many American adults do not remember the order of operations! This education problem is due to a lack of repetition over a series of years. I took physics for 3 years in high school where we repeated the basics from year to year as we worked harder problems and to this day I can still quote equations and tell you how they work. (And I have a terrible memory!). The other thing I think about with math is what Mystie Winkler, a homeschool mom, said. “You don’t need a character curriculum just a math curriculum”. Doing math diligently trains you to persevere through frustration. Math tears are character building if you can press on instead of giving up.The last thing I don’t like about the book is that he seemed to be a secular humanist. I believe math is the order that God built into the universe. It is there to be discovered and not just invented. While I grant that math is an art and that creativity is involved, the right solution matters and not just the journey of how you got it. I also think math is highly applicable to real life and that matters to kids."

There are some things that I wildly disagreed with him on, and others that inspired me to try harder to connect to the subject on his level. He has such a pure and authentic love of this subject he calls, ""the music of reason."" Just that line alone is enough to get me to keep reading!Here was my favorite quote:""As I said before, the most important thing to understand is that mathematics is an art. Math is something you do. And what you are doing is exploring a very special and peculiar place - a place known as 'Mathematical Reality.' This is of course an imaginary place, a landscape of elegant, fanciful structures, inhabited by wonderful, imaginary creatures who engage in all sorts of fascinating and curious behaviors. I want to give you a feeling for what Mathematical Reality looks and feels like and why it is so attractive to me, but first let me just say that this place is so breathtakingly beautiful and entrancing that I actually spend a good part of my waking life there. I think about it all the time, as do most other mathematicians. We like it there, and we just can’t stay away from the place.”I want to get there and feel that way. And that is why this book is worth reading."

(The situation is still the same in India, don't know if it has changed much in USA.) Realised how horribly I was taught and amazed that inspite of those horrors I am still capable of enjoying Maths. (My capabilities are very limited, though)And I need to make just a few points: (This is not part of review of the book/essay, just reminiscences)1. In my village, initially, we were taught by a Guruji (teacher). Most of the teaching was group chanting. I still remember the tables the way we chanted then. And that was lots of fun, I don't know why. 2. Later, in classrooms, I never enjoyed Maths. But I enjoyed doing it at home, alone. When I wanted to. Whenever I could comprehend the idea my way, felt happy, very happy. But my maths lessons were limited to what was considered enough for graduating as an Engineer. 3. When I tried to teach Maths at home to my children, I tried to communicate my enjoyment and failed miserably. My daughter just about tolerated me, but my son refused to be taught my way.4. I taught about half a dozen more. Only one of them was a bit enthused. He did his PhD in Genetics. He is trying to teach me something about Bioinformatics and Genomics in these quarantine times of SARS Cov 2!"
44,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54025312-tr-n,5,"I love solving maths problems. As a student, though not too adept at it, I remember the pure joy of finding an answer match that of the back of the textbook. As a teenager, I used to feel discontent with almost anything different from my set of values, all the drama, gossiping, unfairness I suddenly felt painfully aware of, which altogether made me yearn for the math class coming. Guiltily speakin, it was a way of escapism for a strange student, a solution that I now consider irresponsible as it threw me deep into the antisocial abyss that I sometimes still return.My point is, my view about this book could be biased, as it is like all reviews. Anyway, this book is for anyone like maths, humor, and sarcasm. Having said that, the author is a serious dude longing for changes in the way mathematics is taught. In his view, mathematics, instead of being guided mindlessly with teachers who show no appreciation of its beauty, should be about students engaging in mathemarical reasoning, discovery and conjectures while being guided by someone who can recognize its art form.For centuries, much interest has revolves around mathematics and its application but still, the current math curriculum is actually, as he says, dumbing students down, and worse, creating an illusion of ""good at math"" in people having no mathematical talents while steering real ones away. While he does not explicitly propose a solution, as expected from the title of the book, readers would surely appreciate the art form more and think of it as ""something beautiful and pure, a harmless and joyful activity that has brought untold delight to many people for thousands of years."""
45,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29825333-varad-deshmukh,5,"With a lot of free time on my hands, I have been racking my brains on new methods of learning and educating. This is one of those books that arrives in your hands at the right times. Mathematics has always been one of the most dearest subjects to me ever since I remember school -- something which I excelled and loved. This book has shattered my illusions. I was never taught mathematics, I was trained in mathematical formulae and tempered with formalisms and terms without developing intuition. After encountering far more complex real world problems in science and engineering, I am still struggling with mathematical intuition, whereas my neurological instinct races to what it has been trained best with -- memorize the terms, formulae and the stick to the script. The book is depressing and illuminating. The ideas propounded are so far-fetched, they seem almost unnatural in the background of the mathematical training rooms we have gone through. Definitely a read for all of us who complain why people find math boring."
46,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9492590-tressa,4,"This book (essay) made me think of my grandfather. He would call us on the phone and tell us to grab a piece of paper and a pencil. After some inward groaning on our parts, he would proceed to show us his new, little trick he discovered. He loved to play with numbers and shapes. I suppose that is the whole premise of this essay. Just play and discover. I liked the premise of this essay. I can see how it would make learning math so much more fun, but it really isn't practical. I think it could be accomplished in a small setting, but let's face it, the world doesn't allow for exploration. You have to master what they want you to master troubling as that may be.I appreciated his views on education. Yes, it is true. You don't need an ed degree to teach someone as shocking as that may seem. You just need some excitement and willingness to learn. Anyway, this took me just a couple hours to read and it is worth a read. "
47,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17607121-brindha-sundar,5,"This book is everything that I have been saying when I hear 'I hate Maths'. How could someone hate it? These lines say it all.Sadly, our present system of mathematics education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child’s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn’t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done— I simply wouldn’t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soul-crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education.Everyone knows that something is wrong. The politicians say, “we need higher standards.” The schools say, “we need more money and equipment.” Educators say one thing and teachers say another. They are all wrong. The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, “math class is stupid and boring,” and they are right. "
48,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2075717-robert-b,4,"Lockhart argues that current education in mathematics ignores the fact that math is an art and involves a creative process. Current education, he says, focuses on the what of math and not the why, on the product and not the process, leading to students being able to regurgitate formulas and definitions with little appreciation for why math works the way it does and with little historical context. Students, he claims, should be solving, struggling with problems and not being told how to solve problems; they should be inventing math for themselves. Whether one agrees with Lockhart or not, the short book is well worth reading. I wish that he had suggested more solutions to the problem that he identifies, but he does provide some fascinating examples that cause the reader to think and to reach that “Aha” moment."
49,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/773161-mimi,2,"I'm rating this low mostly because I did not get it. The lament reads more like a long rant that ends up criticizing teachers who currently clearly love math no matter how it was taught. (I loved math in college classes)The author keep making analogies that don't seem realistic to me. It is as if someone learns ASL and I just tell them ""It's art, it's beautiful. You don't need to know the mechanics..."" (directional verbs and that well meaning people keep signing ""Vagina"" when they want to sing/sign about a ""star"" .) You got to learn vocab, crucial hand and 5 finger placement which can change all meaning, lip formation an and brow movement (which can mean the opposite) and then apply it in . He just didn't offer any realistic alternatives to teaching/ learning math and I was hoping for more math lessons. "
50,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8412616-bob,3,"I really loved the idea of this book, which is really a position paper turned into a short book. Mr. Lockhart does a great job of pulling us into the beautiful world of mathematics. I agree with his premise, but the only reason I didn't give it another star is that I feel like he left me hanging. Now that I believe what he's saying, what next? If I want to dive deeper into this realm of math, am I left to figure it out for myself? I understand that a big part of what he's saying is that math is beautiful because it's about exploring in a free-form fashion, but I'd like to see some ideas on what steps might lead me into that kind of exploration, and how I can connect that with the ""grammar"" of math. In other words, I'd like to become a better mathematician, but I'd also like to then explore how all those formulas and phrases can be used. Lockhart does a great job of presenting the problem, but for those of us who would like to join him on the journey, how can we do that?"
51,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115638384-dennis-chen,3,"This is a review of the essay because I am poor and lazy.Lockhart starts out with a compelling metaphor and an unequivocal condemnation of the flaws of math classes. However, his proposed solutions are absurd at best, and his extreme views are neither practical nor reflective of what an ideal class looks like. Finding and clearly identifying a problem is enough to create value in an essay; there is no need to add half-baked solutions in the mix, or extreme views that do not hold any water.I, by the way, have no qualms with Lockhart's attack on most high school math teachers; I am sure they are nice people, but 90% of any art form is bad. It follows that a high proportion of artists are bad too, and ""doing my best"" is not a valid reason to allow boring teachers who know nothing about math to pass down awful and wrong pedagogical lessons to children."
52,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38507603-melissa-riley,3,"I'd give this a 3.5 if I could. Overall, Lockhart's lamentations about the current state of math education is spot on. He talks in lofty terms about the ""art"" of mathematics and how it's lost in the current system. An emphatic yes! from me. However, he offers very little in terms of solutions and comes off as a demeaning, arrogant person more than helpful. The second part of his book where he attempts to answer the problem of the current system seems more like he's showing off than anything. It's a good read, but also feels like being punched in the face by someone trying to get you excited about P.E. "
53,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18021120-david,2,"The book has two parts: part 1 -Lamentation, part 2 - Exhaultation. Exhaultation, about the awe and beauty inherent in Mathematics, is a joy to read. Lamentation, while I agree math education is completely broken, I do not agree that the solution, as the author suggests is a discovery mode of instruction. While discovery, awe, and joy ought take place in a student's exposure to Mathematics, a purely discovery mode is simply not achievable in a classroom. Ideally, a Socratic approach with a tutor, one-on-one, could accomplish this without the silly chaos of pure discovery. But that is not something one can do in a classroom either."
54,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706361-thomas,2,"I think he's right in that the current state of math education in the US is pretty terrible. But I don't think his dream of every classroom being a some ""Dead Mathematicians Society"" is in any way practical. How is some public school teacher with 3+ classes of 30 students supposed to come up with what is essentially individual curricula for each student? Neither do I think that it is the fault of the teachers, as seems to believe. A teacher won't be teaching very long if they ignore the curriculum and do-as-they-please and what good will that do anyone?It's nice when he talks about how much he loves math, and why."

Apparently available as a free PDF online, this enlightening little read will confirm all your lifelong suspicions that your K-12 math classes added up to little more than an exercise in busywork (if you were lucky). Although, perhaps one benefit of all those years of math is that you at least now get to enjoy the author's wonderfully incisive wit, having been a first-hand victim of the subject matter.In closing, I must admit that, like any mathematics text I ever had in school, I found myself peeking forward to the solutions in the back."

Perhaps that is the greatest praise I can give it."

I was sure I was not good at math. I think it would have been interesting to come up with my own math conjectures and theorems. Doing math would have been fun. There did not seem to be much point to math class. It certainly was not fun. I don't remember learning much math history in math class.

I agree that there is more to math than workbooks and text books and everything the schools focus on. But I reject the idea that it has no higher purpose, that it is only a pleasant activity to bring happiness. I think it has the highest purpose of all, to reveal the mind of God!

I don't know if it's just me that would find this amusing, but based on my experience, I recommend it as a funny read too, not simply educational one."
274,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51161691-sita,2,"MehThis book has some great points and you can tell the man is passionate about his field, but there was a lot of redundancy - especially in the first half, some obvious yet unanswered questions, and some seeming contradictions. That said, I nonetheless look forward to reading his follow-up, Measurement, which I hope will explore the questions left unanswered here."
275,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77047005-renata-sandor,5,"The first chapter was a little slow but the second chapter made me think a lot. I couldn't sleep for a night because I got so caught up on finding a prime pattern. Of course I didn't, but I became so enthusiastic that now I'm thinking to pick up a programming language just to run some tests to play with primes. Paul managed to put the thinking hat on me through his book."
276,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51581864-wendelle,5,"A rather original, impassioned proposal from a working mathematician to overhaul the teaching of elementary and high school math curriculum, to restructure it towards a format of guided discovery of structures, proofs and historical import akin to the teaching of art classes, rather than teaching and memorization of rote formulas and terms like 'secants' and 'quadrilaterals'."
277,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87087938-nari,4,"It reads almost like Socrates’ dialogue about math education with a youth. Though I think Socrates will make it less hierarchical. In terms of the content, I think Paul Lockhart brings up good questions about how we teach math and unreasonable expectations we have from students learning math. Definitely worth reading for educators. "
278,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4371602-alex,5,"I just recently wrote that ""The Introduction into Mathematical Thinking"" makes a good first book for the quest of (re)learning math. We'll, let me make ""A Mathematician's Laments"" a good 0th book on the same path. It's short, but it is very passionate and inspiring"
279,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349303-michael,4,"I hated math class, but loved math. This book helped me understand why that was the case. And now, as a parent, it encouraged me to look for settings where math is taught just as we'd teach art, science, English, music—as something to be enjoyed, something experimental and creative."
280,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10882202-jose,5,"Expresses all the anguish that I feel about teaching math. This book simultaneously crushed and invigorated me. I want kids to love math; I want myself to know math even more - this book has helped direct me on the way. An evocative book, especially for teachers."
281,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3887730-beth,5,I'm not one to write reviews - but if you come across this you should definitely read this book! I absolutely loved it - it has literally changed my perspective forever. If you have ever wondered why math class was so dismal then this is for you.
282,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14429079-hilary-shearing,4,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Rather surprising as I loathed mathematics at school. But this was exactly the point of the book. The awful way this creative subject has been and continues to be so badly taught in school. 
283,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41226538-bardia-sh,5,"Changed my view of math, and my view of reality with itGreat book. Changed my view on maths. Changed my view on how I view maths. Changed my view on how I suppress my own mathematical thinking because I think there is a right way to do maths. I'm pissed, but I'm glad."
284,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81087700-denise-bass,5,Omg I loved this book. This is the book I wish I had had when I was graduating high school and swearing off math forever. This is the intro to math rehab. This is the book that every single parent and math teacher needs to read so they learn how to not ruin math for children.						
285,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45853018-vincent-chen,5,"A love letter to mathematics, which includes the anguish that comes when others mistreat your loved ones. Fundamentally, a book about the philosophy of math education. A short, charming read with some really stunning examples. Left lots of annotations in this one. :) "
286,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18267868-vishwesh-jirgale,5,"This is a great essay/book. Says everything I've ever felt about mathematics in schools.Every parent, teacher, student should read this one.There are points where I have some disagreements but nevertheless those are with the processes not the concepts."
287,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2185427-donald,5,"I love reading books that explain elegantly something I already agree with. The fun part about this one is that it applies to every subject taught in schools.Fellow parents, homeschool your children!"
288,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68645492-stephen,5,BrilliantWould recommend for anyone who is curious about mathematics wether they have a background in it or not. Quick read.
289,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51545226-penny,4,"This book presents a good idea on math education. It makes sense for ingenious students, but might not work for everybody."
290,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,5,"Extra required reading for anybody that teaches math, whether at home or in a school setting. The best proselyting pamphlet for math out there. "
291,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72594721-aaron,4,"Lockhart makes very good points about mathematics education that require action to reach any formative conclusion. To make essay less of an esoteric work, he needs a plan."
292,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63814079-dan,2,"En general, un divague."
293,1934137170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3133132-amy-c,5,A beautiful walk through the world of mathematics as it should be. I recommend this to everyone.
