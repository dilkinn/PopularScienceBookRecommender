0,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,4,"This was a great book. We cannot surely know for sure which the end of the universe will be yet, but Paul Davies does a great job explaining the possible scenarios and describing the processes behind them. Of course, by reading so many science books, some ideas were repeated, for exemple a great deal of stuff explained by Stephen Hawking în his books, but the book is well structured and follows a good path în logic. The author manages to explain very well some quantum principles (Heisenberg uncertainity principle, quantum tunnelling, etc), elementary black hole theory ( for ex. Hawking radiation), or baby universes.""Maybe all we can hope for is that our ancestors will get to know the meaning of the Universe before the end of the last three minutes."""
1,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,5,"At first I scoffed, because, hey, you don't need to explain how gravitational lensing works to ME. But even when he was telling me something he knew, he was so overly dramatic as to elicit glee. And by the time he was throwing out calculations as to how to build a superbeing that can overcome the burning inferno of the final contraction of the universe, I had already regained my failing libido, and more."
2,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This book repeats several familiar cosmological themes: there was no time before the Big Bang, the Big Bang is the origin of space, space stretches through time, and this stretching continues through eternity, or until it begins to collapse back on itself through gravitational attraction (Big Crunch). For the lay person, understanding is feeble, even though there is great appreciation for all the cosmic mystery and majesty, and many key questions are left unclear. For example, the author says that energy (light) has mass and therefore has gravitational attraction, but there's also a hint that space, constituted by mass, is subject to gravitational pull, and that light is curved because it rides through (on) space (as opposed to light itself having mass that is subject to gravitational pull).Somehow in this zillion-year cosmological history, Davies offers the possibility of human survival, which strikes the reader as more a secular aspiration for eternal life than as reasoned conjecture. Davies also shuts down any question about whether time and space existed prior to the Big Bang. At an intuitive level, one gets his point, but the question still seems so, so legitimate. The most disappointing part of this book is his discussion of the tension between order and disorder (entropy), with the latter the ultimate victor in cosmic time. ""Order"" he says is ""information"" as if the meaning is self-evident. Typically, information is understood as the ""meaning"" an organic body takes from its environment. Whether an exchange of ""meaning"" occurs between inorganic bodies (e.g., via electromagnetic forces, gravitons) when they influence each other is left unclear. It's not easy for a layperson to venture into cosmology.  "
3,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5085729-feliks,3,"A wonderful anecdote to the tedious gushing and over-exuberance of today's science-groupies. Dash of cold water in their faces. For us realists, this is a book designed to satisfy. What is all this lust for gadgetry and technology lately? In this unique book, the straight dope is dispensed: our planet will one day die; our sun and moon will one day collapse. The Milky Way galaxy too, has a 'lifespan'. So do all the stars. The universe itself in no way, lasts 'forever'...there is no 'eternity'. And there's nothing anyone can do about this.Everything comes to an end somehow. This book steps way up above it all to look down at the universe with a cold, candid, unafraid eye and tells us (no sugar-coating) where everything is ultimately headed. Death.Its well-written and engaging; also succinct. Each aspect of the manner in which galaxies, solar systems, space, time, energy, matter; the universe itself--EVERYTHING--must at some point, dwindle and expire--is described with dexterity.And its great. Freeing. Knowledge is power; its better to 'know' than to 'not know'. Can really put you at ease and at peace. (the way I see it, the moral of the story here is to party it up!) "
4,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,4,"There is one small chapter missing about the possible last three minutes of our world. Here goes -""So What? I lied, you mentally deranged dotard!!"" the short plump guy laughed balefully. ""You maniac little rocketman. Prepare for fire and fury,"" screamed angrily the taller and plumper man. ""ele le le le le…ulu lulu lu…""""You $@#@&^ *^&$"" And then both of them reached for the red button on their tables simultaneously. ---------------------------------------Jokes apart, this book is really as good as any other Paul Davies book goes. It always fascinates me to read the words 'blackhole' and 'proton' in the same sentence or talks about what would happen in the millionth of second after trillion trillion years. Mere extent of scale boggles the mind. Predicting future is a favorite activity of students of astrology and astronomy alike. Does the universe end with a big crunch or freeze itself to death? Is there a purpose to this life or life is meaningless or the meaning of life could be never found out before it ends? Hope that these questions don't come up to your mind when you are sitting alone on the banks of a big serene river, lest it would make you depressed. Loved the concluding remarks by Davies -""If there is a purpose to the universe, and it achieves that purpose, then the universe must end, for its continued existence would be gratuitous and pointless. Conversely, if the universe endures forever, it is hard to imagine that there is any ultimate purpose to the universe at all. So cosmic death may be the price that has to be paid for cosmic success. Perhaps the most that we can hope for is that the purpose of the universe becomes known to our descendants before the end of the last three minutes. """
5,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472316-zulfiya,3,"I like reading science books, and I like reading about cosmology, but this book missed the target with me. The intro was engaging, and I somehow thought that the author would focus more on the possible demises for the Earth, but he moved to bigger things as the title promised, and it was .... dry. I did find some explanations and arguments convincing and interesting and accessible even to laymen, but the scientific story of the end of the universe did not cohere in this rendition. On the other hand, I liked how the authot addressed the questions of futility of our existence and offered a ray of hope when he introduced the concept of multiverse. Mostl likely I would have given this book a 4 star review if I had not been listening to it while driving. Then it is truly - mea culpa. "
6,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"This book was quite interesting. The cover pretty much sums it up. Ever since people figured out that the Universe is expanding, it immediately followed that it must have had a beginning. Before this, many scientists merely assumed that the Universe just lasted for an infinite amount of time. Given that the Universe had a beginning it must also end sooner or later. The matter of how it will end is up for speculation and there are several possible ways. None of these ways are particularly pleasant, but I can take solace in the fact that I will be long dead by the time all of this comes to pass. We're not talking about decades, in this case, we are not even talking about millennia. Billions of years must pass before any of this even comes close to happening. By that time the sun will run out of Hydrogen Fuel to use and will start to use Helium to fuel itself. At that point, the Sun will expand until it engulfs the orbit of Venus and the oceans will boil away.Of course, we could also be destroyed by a giant asteroid or some other space object. This too would take a while, but we are protected in the sense that space is massive, and the Earth is relatively small in it. So then there are other ways for our Galaxy to Bite the Bullet, so to speak. It could collide into another Galaxy, There could be a Giant Black Hole that sucks us into itself, but none of these events are very likely.The ultimate end of the Universe depends on two things. The first is the amount of mass in the Universe, and the second is the rate of expansion of the Universe. Now, these are generally called the Big Crunch or the Big Freeze. This is generally what I call them. Either the Universe collapses back on itself, or it expands so much that new stars cannot be born. All of the stars will eventually become either Black Holes or Black Dwarfs, massive chunks of matter that are mere husks of what they were.None of this is really important, though, since I will be long dead by the time all of this happens, unless they find some way for me to become a Star Child a la 2001: A Space Odyssey."
7,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116659472-brad,2,"Well, I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but boy! this book is full of some pretty high-end concepts and jargon. It seems like there are two scenarios that are the most likely - either the universe expands forever, in which case every star burns out and the universe is basically ""dead"" - or the expansion stops, and the universe contracts back to something akin to ""before"" the Big Bang. There are other theories as well, but it seems like these are the most generally accepted.I guess I was looking for something more - ""philosophical"". This is a pretty short book, and I zipped through in a couple of days, largely because the discussions were page after page of concepts I could barely wrap my head around. This was also written in 1994, so I'm not sure where the state of this theorizing is 26 years later."
8,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82290922-daniel,4,"Well executed except....This book was very readable and contained many interesting possibilities for the beginning, middle and end of the universe. The one issue I had with the book was the minimal time spent explaining the last three minutes. I felt that information was rushed or not developed as well as the other areas of the book. Perhaps my novice level makes me want more depth when perhaps no expansion of the theories are currently developed. I was just expecting more about the last three minutes due to the title. The information that was provided in the book was well researched and explained- if you are interested in physics, astronomy, origins of life and the future of the universe, I highly recommend the book."
9,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,5,"This book turned out to be great, as well as really unique. Although it started off pretty slow, just recapping a lot of basic cosmological stuff that I was already familiar with, it quickly picked up and began actually talking about the ""last three minutes."" Most science books for the general reader haven't talked about this topic in a way actually backed up by real science, so I really enjoyed reading this. A lot of really interesting theories about the way the universe will end, none of which are particular hopeful. Oh well, as Bertrand Russell believed, maybe there really is no purpose to life. "
10,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104629015-jake-woolley,4,"Will the universe disappear in the blink of an eye. Will we be slowly crushed or burned to death. Or will it be something entirely different? Paul Davies illustrates the multiple theories of the universes' inevitable demise. He incorporates a variety of theories based on religion and science and discussed how possible these theories all are. By the end of the nonfiction novel, Davies has formed a detailed opinion on each of the main theories and formulated his own prediction of how both humans and the universe will go."

18,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,3,"An entertaining and often interesting assembly of ideas around what might happen in the last three minutes of the universe, whether big bounce, fading away like a pair of cosmic jeans, or big crunch.It was a Paul Davies book – The Mind of God as I recall – that originally turned me on to cosmology. Having failed to be impressed by Hawking, I was blown away by his well-expressed and utterly mind-bending insights into the way the cosmos works. The trouble is that you can only be a cosmology virgin once. That may go some way towards explaining why I didn’t find this book quite as impressive as that. There’s nothing quite like the first time, so they say.This felt more of a pot-boiler to me, an attempt to keep the income flow going. I don’t mean that entirely cynically, since we all need to pay the rent! But I did get the feeling that many of the same ideas and discoveries he has already presented were trotted out again, and not always in a convincing order. For example he moved abruptly from an exposition on the decay of positrons and other aspects of particle physics to mind-bending looks at the big picture, (the utterly gigantic picture) – somehow it felt to me more like a ragbag assembly of things than a carefully constructed presentation. If you want to be blown away, read The Mind of God. "
19,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157031-matt,2,"The in-depth descriptions of the world being destroyed by an asteroid, the universe dying a slow, cold death, and the converse possibility of its contracting into a reverse Big Bang that crushes all space and ends time were pretty rad. But they also felt watered down and rushed through to make room for Davies's speculation on how humanity's super-intelligent descendants might find miraculous ways to survive the apocalypse, and for some bad philosophizing about how maybe it's really death that gives life purpose (wooow!), all of which seemed really silly, gratuitous attempts to make the universe's end smart a little less and the reader feel that our lives are of more cosmic importance than they are. But maybe I'm just one of those cats who ""seized upon the seemingly inevitable degeneration of the universe as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics to support a philosophy of atheism, nihilism, and despair."" Yikes. You know it's summer when I'm including quotes in my goodreads reviews."
20,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30079754-octavia-cade,4,"I believe I actually understood most of what Davies was talking about! (Or at least I thought I understood it, which is a step up from a lot of astronomy books for me.) It's always good to see a book that purports to be written for laypeople actually, you know, be written for laypeople. And I was fascinated. Davies has a very lucid style, which makes the very interesting ideas he talks about clear and compelling. The diagrams were both simple and useful, and I liked the wry touches of humour and science fiction that leavened the cosmological concepts. Would definitely be willing to read more by this author in future! "
21,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"Taking the title from Weinberg's The First Three Minutes, the classic popularization of the big bang theory from 1977, Davies summarizes the scientific theories concerning the end of the universe, as of 1994. The book was quite interesting and informative, although cosmology has changed so much in the past eighteen years that in some ways it seems very old fashioned. I need to read science books when I get them instead of leaving them on my TBR list for years; the fiction and history will keep but these don't as well."
22,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This book speaks on the birth and the ultimate death of the universe. The last three minutes details the accounts that lead up to and end existence as we know it. The corporeal world is very finite. This book won't allow you to think anything else. Maybe you could call this an ""emo"" book because it makes everything seem futile in the end. I loved this book and the doomsday description of our universe. Sad."
23,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25824532-ian,0,"A well-written summary of the current thoughts on the origins and the potential end of the universe. I enjoyed the first half, which is a reminder of possible origins and reflects on Steven Weinberg's excellent book more than the second half. The second half is by its nature very speculative but seemed a little fanciful although almost any half sensible idea could turn out to be right. Nevertheless, the discussion of possible futures is quite fascinating."
24,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40672-giddy-girlie,4,"Ryan picked this up at the $1 book store and I was so desperate for something to read that I took to reading SCIENCE in the bath. It is surprisingly good. It's written in plain english, which is nice, even though it's pretty complex stuff. I learned a lot about stuff that I thought I already knew. And now I am obssessed with how much the universe weighs. THANKS Davies!"
25,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031980-mary,3,"I read this book for an intro honors physics class in college. I found it easy to read and understand. Even with tough subjects and no previous knowledge in the field, I was able to read this book without much trouble. I would recommend this for people who want to know more about the universe, how it began, and how that beginning relates to how it may end. "
26,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32946998-suzanne,5,"This book took me there. I felt like I witnessed the end of everything. Very well presented, as Davies always does. He does not let the reader down in this work. It is as he promises; a real experience of the last three minutes. The physics involved in digesting the events of those minutes is extraordinary. Davies leaves no stone unturned. A must read for anyone who exists. "
27,0465038514,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183253-jon,3,"Less interesting this time around; the details of and support for scientific theory are mainly brushed aside in favor of very tenuously connected speculation. It also seems, oddly, more dated than Weinberg. Still a useful read for those interested in scientific eschatology, both the broad strokes (""Forever is a Long Time"" is the strongest chapter) and some odd little corners."
