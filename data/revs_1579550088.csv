I see it happen with conspiracy buffs, ideologues, philosophers, and yes scientists. I read this book years ago and gave it a five remembering how beautiful the ideas were. The patterns generated by cellular automata were compelling. Surely there was some principle where such simple rules could generate such complexity. I found the idea of computation equivalence the idea when something becomes computationally complex to the point of being incompressible (think Greg Chaitan or compression that goes on with data) that it becomes computationally equivalent to all other random incompressible data. While feasting on this grandiose synthesis with some fairly big claims that all sufficiently complex or random phenomena were conscious. It seemed weird and interesting. But in the past ten years where have these ideas gone. It seems like it went nowhere. I think Wolfram by striking out on his sequestered research into his explorations of cellular automata did not get enough feedback into his own ideas and was seduced by them and having been seduced shared them in a seductive way to people who were also hypnotized by his automata. I am not slamming the book I still give it four stars for being interesting but it seems that his vision as interesting as it is a bit overblown and has not been extremely fruitful. Such is falling in love with ideas sometimes the beloved is a mirage.Here is a mostly unrelated talk that uses cellular automata. I haven't seen many books on the problem of Boltzmann brains. Sure wish I did.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB1-7...Here is a video with a more positive take on Wolfram and cellular automata. I like this particular YouTuber.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wAYZ...here is a video of Stephen Wolfram on what he is up to lately coming up with a theory of everything.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI0AZ..."

It was difficult to get past Wolfram's outsized ego, but I was finally able to do so by alternately considering it sympathetically (thinking of him as desperately seeking validation) and comically (his statements of priority and the importance of his work are so over the top it's really kind of entertaining). I also had some strong issues with Wolfram's discussion on natural selection, as well as his discussion of intelligence and life (he would have benefited from a reading of Maturana and Varela). And his principle of computational equivalence doesn't seem to recognize that something like a brain in effect channels computations toward unlikely computations that simpler but ""computationally equivalent"" systems do not. Despite these reservations, the book is a wonder, and seeing him deftly redefine such fundamental concepts as randomness and to effectively provide a proof of Godel's theorem in the span of a few short pages using substitution systems was to see a small miracle of human thought. His discussion regarding the limitations of current mathematics (that this field has in fact only explored a small portion of ""math space"") was fascinating as was his exercise in translating axiomatic systems into automata-like conceptions. Beyond specific insights and deep analysis, the sheer amount of methodological work involved in Wolfram's explorations is humbling. In short, while this book and Wolfram's vision would have benefited greatly from a restraint on his egotistical ramblings, I do think this is a very important contribution that that will likely spur creative research far into the future. "
2,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"More like ""A New Kind of Ego"".Wolfram's inflated ego dominated this book so much that I found it unreadable and started skimming. What's worse is his self-aggrandizement is undeserved. Wolfram did not discover Cellular Automata, nor was he the first to see potential in them, so basically he's a pretender. In addition, others who have worked in this field have written without the egotism.The book is short on content. There was some info there, but nothing to justify the title or the bloated length. I wonder how short the book would have been had he cut out the self-promotion?"
3,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,4,"this book is a mixed bag. You really have to selectively skim chapters that look interesting because you will never make it fully through. I thought some of the chapters had some very interesting results, however, and the notion of a computational universe is very intriguing and interesting."
4,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/592965-ben,2,"Pascal is famously quoted (paraphrased):I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.If Stephen Wolfram worked on this tome for about a decade, I hate to see what he cut it down from.Even for a book written so as to be approachable by non-technical lay readers, this book is excessively repetitive, and verbose, and repetitive. 200 pages in and I've yet to read anything that I could identify as shockingly new or usefully foundational; nothing that I hadn't been exposed to by authors whose own books or articles significantly predate A New Kind of Science. It is, so far, excellent marketing material.----------The chapter on fundamental physics was interesting, at least for a non-physicist. However there is little else in the book than does not seem obvious from reading other authors who write better and bloviate less. "
5,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17081670-warren-mcpherson,3,"This is a fun easy to read (but huge) book that gets you to think about how very simple algorithms can create fantastically complex results. The author has a giant ego, which is arguably justified but it turns many people off. The key is not to take it too seriously. Don't compare it to a revolutionary scientific tome, compare it to a Pixar movie. Let the book stimulate your brain and enjoy the sensation."
6,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467915-alex-covic,2,"Wonderfully printed, easy to read, marvelous to look at, pretentious piece of quack.It was hard to pass the Introduction and the first Chapter, when you hear the author praising himself, his own importance and why literally 'everybody' in science and why science itself is 'wrong' and did not 'see' what very self-aware author sees, but nobody else. The book is a massive piece of rarely to find print. I was self-published by the author to assure the quality of the printing. It has many black-and-white Illustrations and pictures to accompany the text. The text, when it is not about self-praising, is rather easy to read and easy to understand for non-academics. So what is it about?It talks about the 'big' picture in nature and science. Stephen Wolfram is a well known 'Wunderkind' in theoretical physics. He made his PhD in 1979 at the age of 20. In the mid-1980s he founded Wolfram Research Inc. and invented 'Mathematica' the leading software for technical computing and symbolic programming.Wolframs main thesis of the book and the solution he offers are easy to understand:""... very simple programs produce great complexity. For all it takes is that systems in nature operate like typical programs and then it follows that their behavior will often be complex. And the reason that such complexity is not usually seen in human artifacts is just that in building these we tend in effect to use programs that are specially chosen to give only behavior simple enough for us to be able to see that it will achieve the purposes we want"" page 3 This is the crux of the book, there, luckily on page 3. If you read the 12 Chapters (846 pages plus around 250 pages of notes and additional massive Index, than it is most likely, that you do it because you like an intellectual exercise or because you love books and don't mind the many times annoying voice. I am not going to discuss the results of such a vast amount of research and work that went into proving and verifying his idea. There are plenty of scientists from his fellow theoretical physics to mathematicians and others that reviewed and challenged Wolfram's book over the past years. There is even a great discussion a the slashdot-forum that mocks the authors writing and is funny and hilarious to read for nerds like me. May reviews and articles are online and it is easy to find them, if you want to.Beyond the Masters Voice, this is a lovely book to look at. An artifact in these times of trash-quality publishing. It is not a masterpiece of printing. You cannot compare it with bibliophile editions. But for science books, if you have seen a physical copy of it, it is more on the upside, which tells you where we are nowadays, when it comes to print.There is a complete online-version of this book now available for free on the Wolfram Research Homepage. The whole thing. For the curious minds."
7,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"This is what happens when you tell an incurious child that they're really smart and never force them to interact with people brighter or more knowledgeable than them. I suppose if you cut out all of the self-indulgent filler trying to set up Wolfram as the revolutionary super-genius king of the universe solving all of science forever (a king with surprising gaps in his knowledge when it comes to, e.g., information theory), you're left with a pretty uncontroversial if very muddled and painfully unrigorous paper on cellular automata; it will also only be about fifty pages long.So, since my opinion of A New Kind of Science is pretty much in line with that of every other non-lay reviewer, let's focus on the good stuff, all of which contributed to my giving it two stars rather than one:1. The book is sufficiently impenetrable that laypersons aren't likely to read more than a few pages. The sort of people with the stamina to read the whole thing will tend to be the sort of people who will see through Wolfram's bullshit. This matters; it means the only question I'll likely ever have to answer because of this book will be what cellular automata are at all.2. Though my edition is hardcover and I usually hate hardcover books, it's the sort of hardcover that will stay open on its own without damaging the spine or stressing the bindings.3. The book itself does look pretty impressive, and it has a lot of plausible-looking pictures. It's perfect for leaving on a coffee table to impress non-hard-sciences guests if you're too hung-over to do the impressing yourself. That's not likely to come up for me (I don't even own a coffee table), but I appreciate that it's possible in principle.4. It came with a bookmark.Otherwise, though, yeah. Consider this one of those books that I read so nobody else ever has to."
8,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442217-hobbes,4,"This book, at about 5,643 pages, was a fascinating read. Wolfram unveils a new way of thinking about how the world works. To this less intelligent mind it looked more like an outgrowth of the chaos movement than something entirely new but whatever it is, and however correct it is, there's no question that Wolfram did move some horizons back. Unfortunately the other message he seems to want to communicate is how amazing Stephen Wolfram is, and the ego can get in the way of the science through-out this voluminous work.There's extensive use of graphics through-out the book which is immensely helpful to understanding what exactly it is that he's trying to say. As I understand it, Wolfram under-priced the book by personally subsidizing each copy himself in hopes that more would by it. At around $50 a pop it's not exactly cheap but based on the content I still believe this claim. Highly detailed images adorn every other page and the amount of research done is beyond question. There's a lot of repetition, but the repetition is always at least phrased in new ways as if to help us understand rather than fill space.I'm attempting to avoid the actual scientific thought put forward in this book mostly because it takes Wolfram tens of thousand of words to lay it out and I feel almost disrespectful trying to accomplish that in a sentence or two but I suppose it would be of value to someone trying to decide if they would like to read it. The central theme is the idea of complex results emerging from very simple laws and inputs. This sounds a lot like chaos theory but the level of simplicity he demonstrates leading to truly complex results is quite astounding. There is a great deal of work gone to trying to show this theory in the realm of science, incorporating it into the fields we're familiar with. Computational equivalency plays a large role as he attempts to show that these findings aren't a dead-end but a real possibility for new discovery.For those who are somewhat interested but not sold I would recommend finding it somewhere (library, friend's house) and reading the first chapter. That contains much of content of the rest of the book, and gives a good feeling for how it will read. If you don't like it you know to read the rest but will probably have learned some important lessons anyways in the reading. If you do then get your hands on the whole book. As a warning, this one could be tough to make it through in the time you're likely to have if you get it from a library."
9,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3880334-john,4,"I have to admit that I did not read the 1000 plus pages. The idea of cellular automata is interesting, so I programmed some of his examples for fun. He is not a crank and has done serious scientific work, which I am not competent to judge. There is a measure of jealousy in some of the comments by his peers, since he has made a comfortable income from Mathematica. He bought his own Cray computer to play with. The most damaging review was, referring to the title: ""What is new is not science; what is science is not new"". As a layman, I sense that he is on to something here, but extends it too far. My scientist wife does not agree (that he is on to something). His arrogance is annoying, but I have worked for many scientists who have the same sense of self-importance."
10,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795729-chris,4,"This is a really intriguing book. There is much to like about it, especially the chapter notes in the back, where he goes into a lot of historical background on the development of symbolic logic and the attempt to formalize mathematical operations in the late 1800s by Russell and Whitehead, among others. Wolfram's computational approach to analysis has some definite advantages over more conventional axiomatic methods, and has led to some powerful intuitions. However, I think the author tries to take some of his conclusions a bit farther than their usefulness merits. While the author is obviously a very gifted mathematician with a vast knowledge of the history of science and math, I find his insistence to have ""changed everything"" with his new approach to be a bit over the top. Wolfram was certainly at the right place at the right time to be able to open up new avenues for mathematics through the application of computers for modeling and calculation. Mathematica, the software he developed and became renowned for was truly revolutionary. This book, while an interesting read with a lot of good background material on all kinds of science related topics, doesn't seem to achieve its goal of truly revolutionizing the way science is approached."
11,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14190274-chris-reid,3,"I desperately wanted to love this book, and I'm glad I slogged through it; however, there didn't appear to be much here that hadn't been articulated better elsewhere, earlier, and with arguably more grounding. If Wolfram wanted to associate himself with these ideas he would've been better off writing a biography than this sprawling treatise. He's clearly brilliant, and part of me hopes (for the sake of the story) that we're all missing something, but as it stands A New Kind of Science is merely a book that I liked, instead of the transformational book I was promised."
12,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5472385-val-delane,4,"Stephen Wolfram has an ego the size of Jupiter, and he does not credit contemporary researchers in the body of this epic work--but based on the clarity and completeness of the presentation I am willing to believe he personally derived and/or verified everything in it from first principles. No matter what else can be said about Wolfram, he is extraordinarily gifted. I bought this book as the ""bible of cellular automata"" and found much more to ponder than complexity in algorithmic art."

16,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/650142-alex,4,"A fascinating book to read. The computer scientist in me finds Wolfram's approach absolutely credible and spine-chillingly tantalizing. We could learn so much from this. Truth be told, though, I'm not qualified to judge how much potential Wolfram's ideas have in real world science, and while reading, one wonders whether this is the work of contemporary genius on the scale of a new Einstein (for that's what it feels like — reading Wolfram's shockingly straightforward approach to science is like staring the deceptively simple E = mc^2 in the face), or perhaps is the work of an isolated programmer who likes his programs just a bit too much. Again, not for me to judge, but I thoroughly enjoyed the work.There is so much meaty deliciousness in this book, such that I often found myself rereading, and then rerereading certain pages to make sure I caught everything. But there is also so much dry explication of tedium. Wolfram, for the sake of scientific thoroughness, does not hold back in recounting the exhaustive details of much of his research. In other words, this isn't just a book, but an extremely long scientific paper including data perhaps subject to peer review. If you dive into this daunting tome, be prepared for the infinities of mathematical tedium as well as the exhilaration of new discovery.Perhaps the greatest highlight of the book are its gorgeous, high-resolution renderings of Wolfram's cellular automata. They are so intricate and beautiful they should stand as works of art in a museum.I certainly glossed over portions of this book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it overall. For a programmer and fellow cellular automata enthusiast (for if there can be said to be such a thing, I am one), this book contains many joys."
17,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37533139-ezzaoudi-ghalia,4,"The exiting book ""A New Kind of Science""is written by the worldly known scientist Stephen Wolfram. The book talks about computer science.In the book he shows his unexpected result. Wolfram uses a remarkable way of problems in science, explains the origins of physical systems,and the difficulty of biology. The book is very clear and it is illustrated by a lot of original pictures. He also explains us how the language can be changed in a computer language using just a few lines of code. The book is really interesting. It can help people who want to be scientists. The book is part of physical science. It is a very interesting book. The author said that this kind of science should have its own new branch. The book is very useful if someone wants to do a project about computer science. It also can help us design an experiment. As one can see, thus interesting non-fiction story is very well developed with facts. This interesting book would recommend to any person that likes science. First, this book would be recommended to all the people who like to know more about computers and softwares. It is a little hard so I recommend it to the 9th and 10th graders who are interested in new technology. As one can see, this interesting book can be recommended to people who like science."
18,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/403565-robert,4,"Wow, this is a huge book. It's fascinating and infuriating and did I mention huge. There are two main issues I have with the book. The first is the way that Wolfram dismisses natural selection as a significant force in evolution. He argues that biological systems couldn't possibly become optimized for a purpose based on this kind of random search. It's an argument that's close to Intelligent Design... organisms aren't perfect, and they're not in any sense trying to be. The second issue is the supposed power of universal computation. Wolfram makes the case that universal computation arises in diverse systems and is far more common than one would suspect. He goes on from there to claim that ""simple"" universality explains all sorts of phenomena including human intelligence . But a universal computer isn't sufficient. The face that lots of systems can be considered computationally equivalent doesn't tell you anything about the program, nor does it tell you if the system can run the program in a reasonable amount of time. "
19,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,2,"An excruciatingly long book, this one. I have immense respect for Wolfram's accomplishments, but jeez, this exploration of cellular automata and simple programs as an answer to everything knocked him down several notches. I was excited to find the book at a Half Price Books priced far less than half. That was the best part of the interaction. Five and a quarter pounds of book is tough to lug around and many hours of lost time for little gain make for an ""it was okay"" rating. I guess I am still impressed somewhat - anyone who can spend so much time watching patterns emerge from repetition deserves a nod for persistence. "
20,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064133-jon,4,"A bold attempt at revolutionizing scientific thought in the context of a computational world.

34,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33252518-matt,2,"Simply put, Wolfram's A New Kind of Science (or ANKS) is a collection of graphical examples across a wide variety of academic disciplines that show how complexity arises from simple inputs, principles, or initial conditions. In this book, all of Stephen Wolfram's examples are programmed using Mathematica, and the phenomena are modeled or translated into various types of systems, like cellular automata or Turing machines.ANKS is an incredibly fun read, but it's practically useless because it neither goes deep enough -- scientifically or mathematically -- nor provides any proof of its statements. In particular, Wolfram's ""Principle of Computational Equivalence,"" which states, within an ambiguous chapter, that all processes in nature that ""evolve"" into or result in complex behavior take the same ""computational steps"" to achieve that complexity. That is to say, all complex behavior can be computed in the same way, whether the computation is done by nature alone, the human brain, or through Mathematica. The issue, according to Wolfram, is our not having adequately formalized this complexity; thus, he claims modern science and mathematics have failed and hence are rendered useless. Again, there is no proof of any kind provided in this book.The fun part comes from reading about the topics Wolfram covers to fit into his ""new"" framework of the universe. ""New"" is in quotations, because the author provides virtually no references to previous discoveries that are a topic of the book, leading the reader to believe that the insights belong to the author alone. His discussions of physics are great, but his discussion of evolutionary biology is sorely lacking due to his incomplete understanding of the field. (This latter point isn't uncommon; ignorant laymen poke at modern evolutionary theory with reckless abandon all the time. For an example, see Gelernter's attack on evolutionary biology in 2019.)At any rate, Stephen Wolfram has positioned himself quite nicely with this text: he doesn't prove anything, and his insinuations and claims are so broad, ambiguous, and interdisciplinary that it's difficult to prove or reject his claims. However, to his chagrin or pleasure, all it takes is a band of disciplined experts in each field to take a look at Wolfram's claims under a magnifying glass to determine whether Wolfram's thinking is mislead or if he truly is the progenitor of the modern era. The mathematician Lawrence Gray wrote a fantastic review of this book in 2003, where he delves into the areas of the book that overlap with his expertise. In addition to Gray discovering a mathematical error in one of Wolfram's proofs in ANKS, he also provides a very wholesome look at the work in far greater depth than any review found on Goodreads, for example.Unfortunately, ANKS offers nothing truly ""new"" since it builds upon previous and current research,but it is refreshing to read about one man's view of the universe that isn't entirely unscientific, which is, for better or worse, exciting and sometimes insightful (though not to the extent the author may believe). In a nutshell, the book is one man's philosophy of the machinations of the universe supplemented by truly interesting illustrations. That's all this book is, however. If any of the topics in this text are of interest, refer to academic papers on the subjects themselves or appropriate authorities on the subject. For as large as ANKS is, it contains very few facts and, coupled with a variety of issues small and large, is best used as a paperweight that's sometimes cute to glance at."
35,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70907778-liedzeit,4,"A big book in every sense of the word. After the advance praise, I expected perhaps even more but this will surely be counted among the more important books. Although it is easy to exaggerate the value of a new thought. And if there is one thing you cannot blame the author for it is false modesty.So what is the new kind of science? The main thought is that complexity arises out of very simple premises. And arising from a simple initial state. Wolfram’s main metaphor (which really is the whole picture) is the behavior of cell automata. There is a tremendous amount of automata that are analyzed hundreds and thousands of prints. You certainly get the impression that the guy just must be mad or a genius. So it is more than just a metaphor. At least I think he gives the impression that the universe can, in fact, be viewed as one big cell automata, cells building patterns in a discrete time and space. (Which would substantially support my own view of a Tractatus like world, by the way.)The whole 20 years research leads Wolfram to formulate his Principle of Computational Equivalence that states “that all processes, whether they are produced by human effort or occur spontaneously in nature, can be viewed as computations.”This to me seems a rather trivial basic truth but the author is very impressed by it and believes that it has richer implications than any other law in science.This is a point where one can have some doubts because the practical implications in truth seem rather lame.An important consequence of the principle is the thesis of Computational irreducibility. Science, Wolfram says, traditionally tries to reduce phenomena, for example by finding formulas to predict some certain behavior e.g. in astronomy. But the principle and its implication state that the description of a system that is not obviously simple (for example repetitive) must be as complex as the described system. "
36,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576645-chet,4,"The author demonstrates with many examples that simple rules of cellular automata, in many cases, can produce complicated and unpredictable results. He calls this the phenomenon of computational irreducibility. This is similar to the Turing Halting Problem: the only way to know when a program is going to halt is to run the program and find out. He compares his discovery to Turing Machines and calls it the Principal of Computational Equivalence. In coming to these conclusions, he compares cellular automata to numerous scientific disciplines including math, physics, biology, social sciences, and many others. He notes that mathematical formulas are often not sufficient to describe many systems.The abbreviated table of contents is not sufficient to guide the reader through the book. Rather than stating his case at the start of the book and then providing evidence to back it up, he starts by giving hundreds of examples of cellular automata and then uses these examples to start making his case of irreducibility, equivalence, and applications to other disciplines, thus unnecessarily keeping the reader in suspense like a cliff hanger. Many of his conclusions towards the end of the book are not proofs, but rather his beliefs that there will be further applications of cellular automata."

52,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10507353-allan,3,"I'm capable of holding conflicting thoughts. Yes, it's a rare book on science that peer review doesn't improve--yet at the same time, some diversity at the margins of peer review is entirely salutary. I harbour a healthy disrespect for peer review as the worst form of quality control, except for all the others. Peer review has an unfortunate tendency to crush what it can't improve or subsume. Excellence of a population can be increased by subtracting undistinguished individuals, without increasing the supply of excellence whatsoever. This is not as often noted by the defenders of peer review as it ought to be. Perhaps Stephen Wolfram's soul could have been saved by working within the establishment. I don't doubt this. But if he wishes not to, I'll take his book for what it's worth on its own terms. For my purposes, I consider Mathematica a halfway passable surrogate. Working code is a harsh mistress. In particular, his success at solving the constraint based system near the end of chapter five is non-trivial. As mechanical verification of theorems improves, the creative mathematician will seek peer review for exposition and clarity, but not correctness. I happen to regard the discovery of complexity originating from nowhere as one of the most important ideas ever. Maddening irregularity was already apparent with the Sieve of Eratosthenes, though I suspect the Greeks underestimated the deeply intractable nature of the prime density function. We also have complexity from Podunk in the ability to construct modern digital computers from nothing more than a nor gate (it can even self-clock if you set up a clock loop). So really, what does rule 30 or rule 110 add to this picture? Having read half the book, I remain unsure. Wolfram's main thesis seems to be that we should accept the complexity that we get from these simple systems as sufficient (if properly applied) to capture most of the complexity we observe in nature. In particular he admonishes us not to complicate our systems in order to replicate complex behaviour. Well, yes, if this works. But does it always work? There are many physicists out there who profess to be disappointed that the recently confirmed Higgs fits the standard model so well as it seems to. No new physics. Boring. As if the world were constructed as our playpen. We tend to have a companion bias that an analytic solution is a good solution. We expend much energy finding analytic solutions, because analytic solutions are the type of solutions we wish to have. I think this is what Wolfram means by a ""kind"" of science, that there's much additional understanding we can squeeze out of the natural world if we relax our obsession with analytic forms. If evolution doesn't restrict itself to analytic forms, why should we? Certainly, we're limiting ourselves if we don't accept nature as it is. But it's also, I suspect, a big step down in the potency of the understanding gained. I wish Wolfram had tackled this ""big step"" more directly. Fundamentally, I found the book evasive. Would peer review have fixed this problem? I don't know. "
53,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25387314-abdou,0,"The first thing that I will start my personal review with is a short review sentence that I found on “Goodreads”, it states that “what is new [in the book] is not science and what is science is not new”. I, if not totally, agree with this statement. Indeed, the science in the book is centred around the theory of Cellular Automate (CA) which was already studied but Wolfram made it more popular thanks to this book. However, the novelty in the book is centred around the idea that CA and computer simulations are better alternatives in dealing with complexity in nature and complex systems than the “traditional” scientific theories based on rigorous mathematical reasoning and proofs. This statement is not scientifically sound as we will see and thus this novelty is not really science.The book focuses on CAs, it argues that the traditional Mathematics and science are doomed because most complex problems in nature are most likely to be undecidable or computationally irreducible (pp. 794-795). Instead, nature is seen as a CA-like dynamical system that follows simple dynamical rules and leads sometimes to extremely complex behaviours. An example of such dynamical rules is “rule 110” that was conjectured by Wolfram and later proven to be complete, i.e. it can be used to simulate a universal Turing machine which makes it equivalent to a computer.I think that computer experimentations using for instance CAs to understand and explain complex system, or to deal with complexity, is an interesting alternative and probably a powerful tool to get around the different difficulties in dynamical systems such as uncertainty and complexity. However, I do not think that this means that it can replace traditional theories in dealing with all kind of complex systems. I also think that Wolfram mentions many “strong” statements without giving enough proofs or evidence. This is obviously not in accordance with the scientific methodology with which science and scientific theories make their advances. This is probably because Wolfram does not care or believe in rigorous proofs. The book for instance and as a whole is such a statement about a new kind of science where this “new” science is based on avoiding rigorous proofs and use of computer experimentations instead.To sum up, “A New Kind of Science” is considered in most reviews as an easy book for non-experts to read but difficult for the experts to use. Wolfram instead summarizes the book by stating that “the core of this book can be viewed as introducing a major generalization of Mathematics”. This is a pretty big deal, bigger than anything ever in the history of science, I now wonder why these big claims did have only small repercussions in the current state of science and particularly in complexity theory. This is sufficient to bring an answer to the question of whether what Wolfram claimed since 2002 is a new kind of science or not. "
54,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1250249-amy,5,"I sometimes read the behavior of a class 4 two-dimensional cellular automaton often known in recreational computing as the Game of LifeI always take the title, A New Kind of Science—a book on cellular automata by “outsider” scientist Stephen Wolfram that I sometimes read—in much the same way as I take the titles of Ken Wilbur’s books, A Theory of Everything and A Brief History of Everything; that is, as An Old Kind of Marketing, one that’s aimed at the reader’s undiscerning desires to have complexity synthesized. If one were to embody complexity with their book title they might be more like Emily Dickinson, forgoing titles for their texts as if to say, I will not Synthesize or summarize—the content as if the Title—is a container—and the Content contained. If Wolfram were Dickinson, his book would be identified by its first line: Three centuries ago science was transformed by the dramatic new idea that rules based on mathematical equations could be used to describe the natural world. If there were no titles, authors would presumably make their first sentence the most emblematic, since this is how others would refer to their books. In Wolfram’s case, he might choose something “random” like I will on page 249, a fragment referring to a photo: the behavior of a class 4 two-dimensional cellular automaton often known in recreational computing as the Game of Life. Readers might say, “There is no way I am going to get through all 1197 pages of the behavior of a class 4 two-dimensional cellular automaton often known in recreational computing as the Game of Life.” Wolfram might say, “In the 1197 pages of the behavior of a class 4 two-dimensional cellular automaton often known in recreational computing as the Game of Life, I propose a new kind of science.” These sentences are more complex than, “In A New Kind of Science, I work with the idea that rules based on mathematical equations can be used to describe the natural world,” because, in the untitled title sentence, there is no verb clause, and the untethered articles and prepositions of the sentence using the untitled title sentence grammatically allow for more. The untitled title sentence embodies some of the complexity that was previously contained by its thoughtless container, which, in this re-imagining, spills out onto itself. I sometimes read the behavior of a class 4 two-dimensional cellular automaton often known in recreational computing as the Game of Life."
55,1579550088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5106403-jean-fran-ois,3,"Firstly, let me say that I read this book 14 years after its publication. The title of my review should probably be ""At the time, a new kind of science. Sort of.""Immediately, what punched me in the face is the pedantic and pompous style: Mr. Wolfram is not known for his modesty, and his writing style reflects that statement. Even if this does not change anything to the ""science"", the style can be annoying at times.I have found the title to be misleading. Mr. Wolfram significantly expanded and vulgarized the cellular automata, however this is hardly something new: cellular automata - at least some of them - were designed and studied by Von Neumann, significant work was done in the Sixties, and Conway popularized the Game of Life in the Seventies.While the study of cellular automata predates Mr. Wolfram's book by about thirty years, it has merits: it makes a good summary of cellular automata, develops some interesting features and, most importantly, created an interest in the field.In summary, this is a good introduction to cellular automata if you are willing to overlook the style and some self-gratifying claims.

Much of the book centers around cellular automata, which demonstrate that simple processes (not necessarily complex ones) can produce complex, even apparently random, results. Cellular automata and this idea are then applied to biology, physics, space and time, and probably other things I’m forgetting. Some parts are fairly interesting, and there are some impressive-looking pictures. However, I don’t think it’s nearly as cool and groundbreaking as Wolfram seems to think--“and this was all completely misunderstood until my discoveries!” Aside from being immodest (and possibly without the dramatic discoveries to back up his claims), phrases like this are repeated often enough to be annoying. In fact, repetition is an irksome problem with other ideas too, and the writing style drove me up the wall: too many short paragraphs, and way, WAY too many sentences starting with conjunctions."

Anyone doing computational science (physics, chemistry or biology) knows that most systems (generally differential equations) can be discretized and fed into computers to simulate. These simulations of course have a limit to their accuracy since they are discrete versions of more realistic continuous systems.Wolfram seems to ignore this inherent limit on accuracy and advocate that discrete systems are all that there is to the Universe. Well, unless he comes up with examples that are not mere discretizations of known continuous phenomena this is not a New Kind of Science.Read it for beautiful pictures and cool automata.
