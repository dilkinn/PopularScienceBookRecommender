0,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Why am I writing this review on Goodreads, anyway? I'm not getting paid for it. There are plenty of other things I should be doing. And it's not like I have a coterie of devoted followers waiting with bated breath for my next review (in fact, the vast majority of reviews I write here get zero comments and zero ""likes""). So why, then?DRIVE has the answer. I do it for me. I do it for intrinsic reasons and thumb my nose at the world of extrinsic ones. I do it because I derive personal pleasure from it, because it challenges me to summarize and critique succinctly, because I am free to be funny, irreverent, scholarly, deadpan, conventional, or wacky. Now THAT'S incentive!And you don't even have to read this whole book to get Daniel Pink's message. For one, he sums up each chapter in a pecan shell at the end of the book, so you can read that instead next time you're at Barnes & Noble. Or you can visit the TED website and watch Pink sum up his message in a speech for free. But if you want the dirty details, read the book. It's fast, it's easy, it's enlightening.The book is chiefly geared toward the business community, but has ramifications for all of us and, in my case, for the education community (where I first saw it recommended). It debunks the myth of the carrot and stick, that rewards get results and sticks get results -- always. No, no, no. Science, Pink says, proves otherwise. And he parades one case study after another to make his point.Perhaps the most salient is the encyclopedia example. Back in 1995, Microsoft paid writers big bucks to write Encarta, an encyclopedia it sold on CD and as software. Only, around 10 years later, Bill Gates' boys had to wave the white flag and fold up camp, vanquished and defeated by a competitor that paid no one -- not a bloody dime -- and offered its encyclopedia for free. That competitor? Wikipedia. Written by everyday Joes and Josephines the world over. For nothing.Then there was the Swedish blood bank. Its administrators decided to cash in by switching from a donation model to a pay-to-bleed model. What happened? Blood donations plummeted. Why? Swedes preferred to give blood for humane reasons, not for blood money. They did it for intrinsic reasons, not extrinsic ones.So what does this mean to businesses? It means the old ways of dictatorial managers overseeing not-to-be-trusted worker bees are over. If, Pink says, you give workers THREE gifts -- autonomy, mastery, and purpose -- they will work like hell for you (because it's as much for THEM). In many ways it makes sense. Given the choice, humans will work for less money if a company offers them more leeway, creative outlets, flexibility, challenges with long-term goals, camaraderie, and raison d'être's (so to speak).Pink points to our childhoods. We're all born with a built-in hunger to learn, to challenge ourselves, to WORK, but schools (and then workplaces) beat it out of us with monotony and inanity, dullness and repetition. What if you got a ""FedEx Friday"" every week -- a day to work on any project toward the company's cause you wished, as long as you presented your results to co-workers and admins the following Monday? That's how Post-It notes were invented by a guy at 3M. The company gave its workers time to manage and challenge themselves. Voila!In education, it amounts to adding relevancy to the classroom. What's the point? How does this connect to the world and how can it be used in the student's future? Can we give students choice, provide the tools, and turn them loose while serving as mentors? Oddly, many teachers cannot and will not because they feel like they will be ceding control AND because they will no longer be doing their job the way they have always done it and/or the way THEIR teachers always did it to THEM (oh, sins of the fathers!).So, yeah. If you don't know the lessons of DRIVE, you should jump on the Autobahn and get up to speed. Really. It's not just for work -- it's for you, too. Motivate yourself. Check it out."
1,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2894762-paul-eckert,2,"I can think of a few alternate titles for this book.“The Art of Beating a Dead Horse: Your Guide to Regurgitating the Same Point in Every Chapter”“How to Filter Years of Other People’s Research into Broad Talking Points”“You Too Can Write a Book With At Least 25% Filler Material”“The Fair and Balanced Guide to Selling Your Point By Avoiding Contradictory Evidence”I jest, yet I do think the main topic of this book is important and true. I will save you the pain of reading it by stating it here: people with non-routine jobs are more effectively motivated by intrinsic rewards rather than extrinsic rewards. People work better when they can have autonomy over their work and pursue mastery of their skills. Appealing to an employee’s desire for intrinsic satisfaction makes for a better long term outcome for both company and employee. The problem with Pink’s book is that he says almost the exact same thing in every chapter. Instead of a progression of ideas, we instead get a boring rehash of the main point, with slightly altered words. Most of this is done by recounting specific studies that prove his main point about intrinsic motivation. However, rarely does he ever mention when intrinsic motivation doesn’t work, except when he mentions “routine, non-creative jobs”. I’d say that a lot of jobs out there are rather routine and non-creative, and I think it’s a mistake to assume that intrinsic motivation has no application for these jobs at all. Additionally, I’m skeptical of anyone that doesn’t at least mention studies that seem to contradict their main idea, which Pink never does. He builds his case by selecting slices of numerous studies, then interpreting the results to fit his narrative. Pink also talks at length about Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow. I have never read “Flow”, yet I hope the concept is better explained in his book, because in Pink’s book it makes no sense. “Flow” is supposed to describe the mindset of a person when they are deeply involved in something (i.e. a star baseball player swinging at a pitch, an author writing a book, etc.), and Pink tries to say that our whole day should be filled with “flow” moments. Sounds okay, but sometimes I think it’s good to have non “flow” moments. At any rate, this whole concept is under-explained and over-utilized in this book. The best part of this book was the concept of intrinsic motivation and how it should be applied in business. Also, it is important to note that extrinsic motivators like “if-then” rewards (e.g., ‘if’ we meet the sales quota, ‘then’ you’ll receive $300) can actually be detrimental to motivation. I wish Pink would have examined the concept of intrinsic motivation in different aspects of life rather than just business. I believe, if explored more thoroughly, it could be very revealing of many different aspects of human behavior. In fact, it would be more helpful to see which motivators are best suited to specific behavioral areas. All in all, this was a poorly written book with a very interesting idea at its core. "

This book helped me understand that our education system requires revolution. It’s obsolete, and completely not prepared for the future.My top 3 takeaways are:* Some people are motivated intrinsically and some are motivated intrinsically. * Extrinsic motivation can kill intrinsic motivation. In order words, if we pay someone to do sth, or we force someone to do sth, then he might lose the intrinsic motivation of doing it. Therefore, don’t pay your kids to do homework, home chores, etc. Also, don’t punish them for not doing it.* Find out what people working with you/for you are motivated with.

Ian:The End is Much More Exciting than It Was Once Upon a TimeThe story of GoodBetterBestReads has really only just begun, but we have already become the world’s largest community of potential readers, book buyers and Kindle users who have star-rated a book at least once in the last 12 months. The problem is you can’t buy a condo or a beer off the back of potential alone. We need people to buy books, and to do that we need people who can sell books.That’s where you come in.If you were ever interested in reading, writing, reviewing, we want to speak to you. We want you on our team. We could harness your skills and change your mind set for ever. We could help you exchange old passions for new. Ever wanted to turn your passion into a career? Easy. We could help you transition from your love of books to a love of sales. The Importance of SalesLook at it this way. There are so many books available now, it would be a crime not to try to sell them.There’s nothing we’ve got that we can’t sell. Without a little help from you.We love books, but let’s face it, we love them even more when they’re at your place.So we need you to find a home for every book we could possibly think of selling. And guess what, we’re totally format-neutral. Tree books, we’ve got warehouses. E-books, we’ve got cyberspace. But to be honest, if we could shift more ebooks, our staff wouldn’t have to work in smelly warehouses. Think about it. Our staff come first.The Next ChapterDo you know what the biggest problem about a community is?The 80/20 rule? Heard of that? It’s worse in cyberspace. Let us tell you. You won’t believe this. 99% of reviews on GoodBetterBestReads are written by less than one percent of the members. Did you hear that? 99%! Let’s repeat it. 99%. Let’s repeat it. 99%.Now, the thing is, we thought that by getting one percent to do all the writing, we could sell to the 100%.We placed a lot of trust in the one percent. Can you see our dilemma? A lot of people’s welfare depended on the one percent.What would happen to our cocktails and our cars and our condos, if the one percent staged a strike? Exactly, you know what we mean. You probably feel the same about your job. VULNERABLE!!! Let’s repeat it. VULNERABLE!!!And You Thought You Knew What a Staff Review Was!Let’s be totally honest with you. Our original business model was flawed. It was too highly dependent on community. There is only so long that the one percent will carry the 99%. And it’s not long. It’s unsustainable. Especially if your exit strategy is a sale to an online bookseller.We suppose we could have encouraged the 99% to do more selling. But honest, what we really want them to do is more buying.So, guess what, we decided to approach the problem a different way.What if we could reduce our dependence on the one percent? What if less people, not more, could write all of the reviews?So now we're going to get our staff to write the reviews. It's so brilliant, it's a wonder we didn't think of it earlier.This is our opportunity to talk about you.If you’re bright...If you’re talented...If you love books...If you love writing...If you love reviewing...don’t worry, it doesn’t matter.We just need you to punch out reviews.Our mission is to help people find and buy books they love. If that’s your kind of story, let’s do business.Our goal: Two million staff reviews in three years!Just think, you could write 30,000 of them!"
5,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book comes with its own summary – a very handy thing:“COCKTAIL PARTY SUMMARYWhen it comes to motivation, there’s a gap between what science knows and what business does. Our current business operating system—which is built around external, carrot-and-stick motivators—doesn’t work and often does harm. We need an upgrade. And the science shows the way. This new approach has three essential elements: (1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives; (2) Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and (3) Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.”Actually, it comes with a series of summaries, which I think is a really great idea. There is also a twitter summary and a chapter by chapter summary. Then there is a glossary and an index … this guy has taken to heart the ‘tell them you’re going to tell them, tell them and tell them you’ve told them’ advice. And although some reviewers have found all this annoying, I found it really useful. In fact, this is a very useful little book all around and one that nicely brings together lots of threads in the whole ‘motivation’ – ‘behavioural economics’ – ‘social theory’ nexus that I’ve taken an interest in lately. To tell you the truth, it is like this guy has been reading his way through my library. In fact, he has read more of my library than I have. Eventually I will get to Flow, for example – but he has beaten me to it, and I will also eventually read Talent is Over-rated – it is there beside the bed, but…The best of this book is that it confirms my prejudices (and, honestly, what is the point of having prejudices if not to have them confirmed?) One of my main prejudices is that money is a crap motivator. This is an idea that is discussed in part in The Upside of Irrationality, however, not nearly as well as it is discussed here. To explain this I am going to tell you a story about an ‘organisational improvement process’ I was involved in once when I was the resident union rat-bag at the City of Melbourne.Actually, the idea was a remarkably good one. I have a preference for processes that ask the people who do the work what their opinions are on how to make the work they do better. In fact, I’m not all that interested in ‘performance’ per se. I tend to think that performance is a function of other things and trying to fix performance is really tackling the problem from the wrong end. This improvement process was known as Qualitas (yes, I know, close to the worst word ever neologism-atized). The point was really good, though. It was for a team of us (four, in fact, two senior management and two union representatives) to go around the organisation and ask people what they do and if they thought there were better ways to do it. Staff were to come up with ways to make things better – according to a series of criteria – and then to work towards implementing the improvements they came up with. All good so far.Then the organisation made what was a fatal and (in hindsight and after having read lots of books on behavioural economics) completely predictable mistake. They linked the achievement of the improvements to a performance bonus. Now, you may be wondering how that could really be a fatal mistake. Surely, if people are going to be paid to do something they are going to want to do it well. Surely, they will also see how important a priority the organisation is making this and ‘put in the extra yards’ to really make things happen. Oh, if only humans were so simple.The problem is two fold. Firstly, staff had to put in many hours of work to achieve the things they set out to achieve in these improvements. Some of these things involved literally hundreds of hours work. But by linking this to pay people started adding up the additional time and effort and saying (quite rightly) that it simply didn’t add up. I can’t remember what people where going to get for achieving their aims – but I think it might have been a 1% pay bonus – or less than $10 per week on $50,000 (about average pay) before tax. People started to think they could do without the $6 a week after tax.Secondly, do you really think the organisation could afford to say staff hadn’t met their improvement objectives? And thirdly, as soon as it was linked to money people started to ‘aim low’. The point was to ‘make the target’ rather than the point of the process in the first place – to find ways to improve.In this book this problem would be discussed as a mismatch of motivators. Taking what ought to have been an intrinsic motivator and instead using an external motivator. And all this comes back to the fundamental assumption underlying most of these problems, the idea that staff in organisations simply do not want to work and will only be motivated to work if they are either punished or rewarded. I’ve worked with people who have won the lottery (quite literally) and still kept coming to work (as they loved their jobs) – so I’ve never really believed that work is just about money.And if that is the only thing you learn from this book, it is a worthwhile investment of your time. I really liked this book – the ideas are clearly set out and it has to be a good thing if people are saying that people need to be trusted to prefer to achieve things rather than to do nothing. My experience has always been that if you create the right environment people will produce remarkable work. The idea in this book of 20% time (where staff are allowed to spend 20% of their time on projects of their own choosing) is very interesting. I would like to try this out in schools if I ever get the chance.This is a very worthwhile book – if you see it in a bookshop just flick to the back and read the chapter summaries – that should be enough to encourage you to buy the damn thing."
6,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/608861-laura,3,"What frustrates me is the main premise has a contradiction that is never addressed. He begins the book with some research on monkeys that demonstrated an innate interest in solving puzzles. He then goes on to describe his big premise which is that we are are in the midst of a major motivational shift. First our motivation was our biological drives. Then came a period of motivation from structure and oversight. And now we want autonomy to determine our own motivation. But Pink's presentation on the monkeys demonstrates that 'even' they are intrinsically motivated to solve puzzles. His premise that since we've shifted to more creative tasks - a new age has arrived. We need to be more aware of intrinsic motivation and create the climate for it to flourish. I think it artificially makes us 'more' different than past generations. And he does acknowledge that past generations were successful in the old model. I don't think we've changed that much. Sometimes we like to be rewarded for accomplishing simple tasks efficiently and other times we like to be challenged by something creative. And therefore the basic analysis seems incomplete. I do agree that motivation and goal setting is a tricky business that is often misunderstood. And negative results occur from seemingly good intentions - rewarding people to do something they want to do for an intrinsic reason. It's difficult for me to let go of this flaw. By overstating the shift, the book plays into the sense of ""oh no the world is getting more complex so we have to get more creative"". So while the book covers some good ideas about motivation, I am cautious about the presentation. "
7,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,3,"So, I listened to this entire book about motivation, and I can't figure out why I don't feel motivated to write a review. No carrot, no stick, no review."

At some point in my life I was type X because I believed external stuff, such as money or recognition, would bring me happiness. But now I am a little more type I because I like to share my knowledge with other people in my life, especially my brother, and I choose to build upon my goals and accomplishments to challenge myself instead of to prove myself to someone. My own internal motivations are at play. I still have so, so much more to learn though. Thank God. "
9,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1523811-phoebe,2,"Only the first chapter is necessary. The rest is repetitious and filled with soon-to-be-obsolete computer metaphors.However, I've been thinking a lot about this book since I read it (a few weeks ago?), so two stars was perhaps a stingy rating. Everywhere I go lately, I see examples of poorly-designed systems, destined to kill people's intrinsic motivation. I recently read ""Unconditional Parenting"" by Alfie Kohn. Kohn's premise is basically that rewarding and punishing children for acting in certain ways only gives them extrinsic motivations to behave how you want and will therefore interfere with their moral development. It makes perfect sense to me that, if the reason a kid shares his toy is because he's after a sticker, he hasn't really learned about generosity."
10,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18622-doug,2,"Some good ideas, but for once I'd like to see a book where the case studies about flexible scheduling and autonomy don't involve software companies or consultants. I'd like to see an example where they motivate DMV employees to work harder to do the same menial work, but if giving DMV employees 20% flex time for their own projects means a corresponding 20% increase in the 2 hour wait time, I'm not on board with it. I don't know why, but it bugs me when authors use software version numbers, the book extensively compares old antiquated motivation 2.0 and new upgraded motivation 3.0 and I get it, 3 is better than 2. "
11,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2616572-jay-connor,2,"As a consultant, I am particularly sensitive to unhelpful jargon and the creation of distinctions without a difference. Enter ""Drive."" This could have been so much better. As Pink presents correctly, much of the research re human motivation IS counter-intuitive to what most of us tend to think is the best way to reward, incentivize or bribe people to act in beneficial ways. Unfortunately, Pink insists on creating such a tower of babble -- ""motivation 3.0,"" ""type-I,"" ""ROE,"" ""if/then contingent rewards,"" vs. ""now/that rewards"" -- that we see the cracks and not the solid surface.Further, why do consultants need to frame everything as either/or (implicit / explicit) when it is in acknowledging the shadings and spectrum that broader engagement comes? This is a book for the choir and not the congregation. So far this year, I've reviewed two other books which have done a much more effective job of covering very similar terrain: Seth Godin's ""Lynchpin"" and Jeff Jarvis' ""What would Google do?"""
12,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829035-donalyn,4,"Reading Pink's book, I endlessly thought about teachers and what motivates us (it's NOT merit-pay) and students and what motivates them to read (it's not pizza coupons or AR points). Funny, insightful, and supported by research, Drive has far-reaching implications for our society and how we view work and the people we try to motivate."
13,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Are you the type of person that is motivated by money and fame, or are you someone that is motivated by having a larger purpose in life? Or are you a combination of both? Financial gain has always been a motivator for me, but I'm also the type of person that will take on extra work, new projects or volunteer my time simply because I like the work and it makes me feel good. It might sound crazy, but I'm not the only one. The volunteer industry is booming with people just like me who are looking for a personal sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that comes from donating your time to a greater cause than your own.The central idea in Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us highlights the gap between what science already knows and what businesses still do. Traditional businesses have always been centered around the premise that you reward good work with more pay, but this system often doesn't work. In some cases, it can actually do more harm than good because people tend to narrow their focus or skip steps when they have an end reward in sight. Many studies have shown that most people aren't motivated by financial rewards. They show that most of us are more motivated and fulfilled by having autonomy (the desire to direct our own lives), mastery (the desire to become better and better at something that matters) and purpose (a yearning to do what we want to do in the service of something that is bigger than we are) in our work lives.I quit my last job because I hated it, and the main reason why I hated it was because my bosses controlled every aspect of my work day. We had no freedom to do the work the way we wanted to do it. One boss in particular literally hovered over my desk to make sure that I was writing and editing something exactly the way she wanted it done, and then she'd still send it back for more revisions. I'd work my ass off and never felt that the financial reward was enough for what I was doing. I soon realized that the greatest satisfaction I get from any job has been about being able to do my work the way I want to do it, when I want to do it. I'm a natural autodidact, so I love to learn and I love to work towards bettering myself, but when I stop learning, I start stagnating. There's no purpose in taking on a job that doesn't allow you to learn and grow with it.I read this book because I'm a new business owner; my partner and I want to create a happy and healthy work environment for our employees, and also because I'm genuinely interested in the topic. I'm walking away with some terrific ideas on how to restructure our business to meet those goals."
14,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Drive, Daniel H. Pink suggests that there is a gap between what ""science knows and what business does."" I was not shocked to learn that this gap exists, and I attributed Pink's decision to emphasize the existence of this gap to what I believe is the author's drive to attract corporate speaking engagements, consultancies, and Op/Ed articles in national newspapers. If he's lucky, he could maybe land a job as a pundit. Ostensibly, Pink's purpose is to share the ""surprising truth about what motivates us,"" and I enjoyed this book whenever I was able to view it as a book about self-determination theory rather than an advertisement for speaking engagements and consultancy.Pink's report on self-determination theory and how it affects motivation is consistently fascinating. We traditionally acknowledge two drives that inspire action. The first is the biological drive, which is intrinsic. The second drive, which arguably has more to do with the workplace than the first, is material incentives, such as salary and punishment. These are extrinsic motivators. Under this view, work is agony and we need careful structures of incentives and disincentives to control employee laziness.What Pink reports is that there is evidence of a third drive. It seems that people find satisfaction in completing tasks. In other words, people are intrinsically motivated to work and produce. The key to motivating workers here is to give them: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. If one of these is lacking, people may actually not feel motivated to work at all. So if workers seem disengaged, Pink's solution is to stop focusing on carrots and sticks and start inspiring workers to feel like human beings by shaping work to engage the third drive. My favorite example of this was when Pink contrasted two approaches to organizing call centers to illustrate 1) the power of the third drive and 2) that even work that we'd often dismiss as a McJob can benefit from this approach.Self-determination theory in the workplace gets interesting when we consider the intersection of money and the third drive. For complex tasks, carrots and sticks actually inhibit performance. Though they can help in the short-term, people that tap into the third drive almost always outperform the donkeys in the long term. Pink suggests that the most useful thing an employer can do to improve performance is to take the discussion of money off the table by offering a fair wage. So long as people make enough money that they feel they are being treated fairly, money will not stop them from performing. Next, offer them autonomy, mastery, and purpose.I found it interesting that Pink often stops to mention that most companies refuse to acknowledge the third drive. When they do acknowledge it, as Best Buy did, they often only allow middle management or higher to experience it. It's almost as though a majority of business leaders refuse to believe that their employees are human beings, as opposed to donkeys. I couldn't help thinking of the novel Fight Club, in which employees quit their jobs because Tyler Durden offers them autonomy, mastery, and purpose through an underground network called ""Project Mayhem.""I actually found a great deal of this discussion fascinating. However, there are some disappointing decisions in Drive. Pink is able to clearly and, for the most part, concisely explain self-determination theory in popular format. At times, there is a little too much repetition, particularly the closing chapter that offers three different summaries (Twitter, cocktail party, and chapter by chapter) of the book's message (autonomy, mastery, and purpose).More annoyingly, Pink continuously refers to the drives as ""Motivation 1.0,"" Motivation 2.0,"" and ""Motivation 3.0,"" which I found an incredibly hackneyed attempt to sound ""with it."" Worse, he doesn't seem to realize that ""Drive"" has a computer science connotation.Things are referred to as the ""Zen"" of management, which, yes, sounds trendy. However, if I could set up some guidelines for authors to follow, I'd suggest they actually research what ""Zen"" means. It is more than an art of motorcycle maintenance and many authors might be surprised to learn that its roots go back further than middle management strategies.Ultimately, I found self-determination theory extremely interesting, and I suspect that Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us will have me thinking about what I do and how I do it for a long time to come. However, it does require readers to overlook a lot of irritatingly trendy writing that tries to ""connect"" with the audience through ""21st century power words"" like ""2.0,"" the ""Zen"" of compensation, and even a Twitter summary."
15,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,3,"2.5 ⭐️'s rounded up to 3 — Interesting approach for a hard to nail down answer. Most relevant for employers trying to extract optimum performance from employees, parents raising children, or those with general curiosity. We're born to be players, not pawns. We're meant to be autonomous individuals, not individual automatons.Best predictor of success: Grit. (I actually liked Angela Duckworth's book, ""Grit,"" a little more than this one.) Second Law of Mastery: Mastery Is A PainA lot of this stuff is pretty basic, and seems to be more of a sweeping overview than anything applicable or too in-depth. As wonderful as flow is, the path to mastery, becoming ever better at something you care about, is not lined with daisies and spanned by a rainbow. If it were, more of us would make the trip.“Being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.”— Julius ErvingThis book is a good summation of a lot of science and theories put forth by others, including a lengthy book review section at the end. If you're looking for something original or groundbreaking, look elsewhere. *However,* it is important to note that rewards don't work as a motivating factor. People are more motivated by internal drives, as opposed to external forces. If you want the best work out of people, let them have freedom and flow, don't micromanage, and don't use money as an incentive for creative output. 
TLDR:
Save yourself the time, and check out Pink's TED Talk.Things to PonderEven when we do get what we want, it's not always what we need.The mastery asymptote is a source of frustration. Why reach for something you can never fully attain? But it's also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? The joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes.- This quote reminded me of the more achievable moon speech by JFK:""But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.""//Our business has evolved into a ROWE, and it's much more efficient.Results Only Work Environment (ROWE): The brainchild of two American consultants, a row is a workplace in which employees don't have schedules.

16,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is another great book by Daniel Pink. It may be a coincidence, but just a few weeks ago I read another book on the same theme: Punished by Rewards: The Trouble With Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A'S, Praise, and Other Bribes by Alfie Kohn. The book by Kohn was published about 20 years earlier, and tells much the same story, in a much more scholarly, and perhaps drier style.Daniel Pink's book, though, is much more readable, much shorter, and has a different slant. Rewards can be used to motivate people to do tasks, as long as these are repetitious, relatively mindless tasks that require little creativity or thoughtfulness. On the other hand, rewards backfire, if the tasks require creativity or original thinking of any sort. The book has an interesting approach toward motivating people with some useful guidelines."
17,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"I read Drive a while back, like in 2012, and as I recall, I sort of liked it, but apparently not all that much, as evidenced by the fact that I retained very little of the materiel, gave it a (x3) star rating and didn’t bother to write a review of it. Anyway, I re-read it as a little supplement to an Emotion, Cognition and Motivation course I’m taking. And as it turns out, it’s better in the broader context of the field. So I’m taking this opportunity to reconsider the book, and give it the ‘once-over-twice’ it deserves.It should be noted that the author of Drive, Danieal Pink, is a journalist not a scientist. Drive is more or less a popularization of the work of Edward L. Deci, and Self-Determination Theory. According to Pink’s account, earlier biologically driven theories of motivation focused on ‘Motivation 1.0’ the innate, instinctive, automatic, evolutionarily conditioned drive systems (survival and reproduction). Later behaviorist theories focused on ‘Motivation 2.0’ which essentially explained motivation in terms of contingency based systems of reward and punishment (carrots and sticks).Self-Determination Theory (SDT) acknowledges the human need for personal exploration and growth as a legitimate motivational drive. What Pink refers to as ‘Motivation 3.0’.Extrinsic Motivation: refers to ‘external’ factors e.g. environmental or socially derived reasons for doing things. Think of the threats to survival and opportunities to reproduce from ‘Motivation 1.0, and/or the carrots and sticks from ‘Motivation 2.0’. Intrinsic Motivation: refers to ‘internal’ factors e.g. things that we do because they are fun, interesting and/or meaningful, as mentioned in ‘Motivation 3.0’. Algorithmic Tasks: refers to programatic, repetitive tasks that can be easily automated. Think; assembly line work in a factory. Heuristic Tasks: refers to interesting, novel work that takes spontaneity and creative problem solving and improvisation. Think; art and design, or relationally driven work like therapist or coach. According to Pink, Extrinsic Motivation (carrots & sticks) works great with Algorithmic Tasks (working in the coal mine etc.), because they are typically uninteresting, and repetitive, and stuff like paychecks and threats of getting fired are basically to only things that keep people motivated to do that type of shit. What is somewhat surprising though, is that Extrinsic Motivators are deadly to the Intrinsic Motivations to do Heuristic Tasks. In other words, if you love to do something, just for the sake of doing it, than adding money and other types of performance based carrots and sticks can actually kill your buzz, and turn you joy thing into a chore. Pink’s ultimate point is, that today’s information base economy is automating (and there by killing) Algorithmic Task oriented jobs. Conversely; today’s economy is rewarding Heuristic Tasks that take creativity and empathy (the shit robots can’t do) like never before. Subsequently, our old school, Industrial age incentive structures (cash and prizes) and management styles (your fired if you don’t do what I tell you to do) are a BIG FAIL in creative and/or relationally driven organizations. Pink posits the following human needs as the corner stones of Intrinsic + Heuristic ‘Motivation 3.0’. Autonomy: the need to be free and direct our own lives.Mastery: the urge to grow and become better at stuff. Purpose: the longing for meaning, and the need to be connected to something bigger than ourselves.If we want to create incentivize creativity and empathy, than we need to integrate autonomy, mastery and purpose into our raison d’être. Can I get a hell to the yeah on that? I’m upgrading my earlier assessment of this book from (x3) to (x4) stars. The is good, but it feels just a little bit dated. It was published in 2011, which seems like last week, but was actually like 8 years ago, and some of the presentation seems kind of iPhone 4S."
18,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5491526-ken,4,"This book has been on my ""to read"" shelf for some time, and while I had read some excerpts, understood the general ideas and seen the excellent RSA Animate excerpt (http://goo.gl/zH1QH), there is far more here than is generally summed up.This book became extremely interesting because it was juxtaposed with a discussion of Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs published shortly after his death. A coworker not known for his managerial skills but who is respected for his results read the Jobs book and commented that his biggest takeaway from Steve Jobs' contribution was that despite my coworker's abusive management style, he was far to kind to his employees. Jobs was notable for his often abrasive and abusive style in pursuit of better results, and many seem to believe that his willingness to disregard others in pursuit of excellence was one of the secrets to Jobs' success. Dan Pink's ""Drive"" offers an alternative explanation and is excellent lens into the true genius of Steve Jobs and those like him.In reality, Pink shows that the strongest results regardless of the field generally come from individuals that are intrinsically rather than externally motivated. Pounding on people in any setting produces short term results, but as Pink shows, can have disastrous long term consequences. Despite this, Jobs and other tyranical managers often show results. I suggest that the reason for their success is really in their ability to choose talent and offer vision rather than their work style. Pink shows via numerous examples that, given resources, freedom and opportunity to develop themselves, people will seek the highest and best use for themselves.While much of the book is a survey of other work (Arielly is mentioned by name, and there is much that is reminiscent of Talib and Gladwell), Pink goes further and adds some insight of his own by expanding on the idea of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivations.More importantly, he adds a series of practical suggestions for developing intrinsic motivation in a number of settings at the end of the book. Practical applications are what is most often missing from books of this genre and his suggestions are welcome.In the end the book is an easy read and is definitely not a panacea for management skill in any setting. But it delivers in the area that it should. It provides a foundation for the reader to consider specific ways they can improve themselves and others. In other words, the book makes you think."
19,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/298500-tomio,4,"I picked this up on a tangential reference from Leah and blitzed through it one gorgeous afternoon. It's a pretty concise roadmap (pardon the pun) of a ""new"" form of motivation theory, one that is centered less on external rewards and more on internal forces. Pulling from and conglomerating a number of other recently-popular texts and concepts, it combines the concepts of flow (from the book of the same name by Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi), 20% time (originally 3M, apparently, but recently brought to the limelight by Google), and the as yet very unofficial ""for-benefit"" style organization that is starting to gain some ground. The result paints a picture very different from the traditional reward/punishment paradigm of motivation, one that speaks of self-direction, personal satisfaction, and pride in one's work (or in Pink's words, Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose).I wax philosophic about this because it rings very true for what I have experienced in my own projects. However, there is one very obvious danger that I think Pink's excitement let pass with only minor mention, and that is balance.Autonomy is wonderful, and that variable is the reason I have loved some work and hated others. However, Autonomy still needs a certain amount of direction, and to be honest, I think it needs to be put in contrast to non-autonomous work. There needs to be the right ratio of freedom to direction, relative to the degree of self-discipline the worker has.Similarly, if mastery of a skill is asymptotic as Pink describes (and I follow that), then from an effectual, time-wrangling standpoint there has to be a cut-off point. If perfection is unattainable, then some threshold must be set to mitigate the diminishing returns. You can't keep slogging away to get that last impossible percent, and you had probably gone farther than you ever needed to at 80% mastery anyway.As far as purpose goes, I think it's not so much a danger that anyone will start waving the charity flag so hard they impale themselves on it. You need resources to support a cause, and if you aren't generating those resources, be they money or manpower or what have you, that system will come to a grinding halt pretty fast. I think the trick there will be in finding the right balance between making and giving that is both sustainable and significantly supporting the cause in question, and convincing investors that it is in their best interest for you to support the cause in the first place.I'm also not entirely convinced Pink's system will work smoothly across the board. There are some people who seem to prefer keeping their head down and following orders. There are some who just don't seek out constant self-improvement. But if this credo of intrinsic motivation spreads, I think it will eventually have a whole swath of societal benefits, ranging from the classroom to the workplace (wherever that may be) to, if one may be so hopeful, international relations. It just needs to be implemented carefully."

Look out for Drive on the shelves from 29 Dec.I'm LOVING this latest book by Dan Pink. A Whole New Mind is a stroke of genius in understanding the way that the world of work has changed, and DRIVE is a powerful extension to A Whole New Mind that argues that, because of the ways that the world of work has changed, carrot-and-stick motivation is no longer effective or desirable. Instead, he explains how you can elicit a much more powerful form of motivation - intrinsic motivation, by creating opportunities for autonomy, mastery and purpose in the workplace.By the time you've read this book, because it's structured so well and written to clearly, you'll probably be able to stand up and give a lecture on the topic, and if you take a bit of time to review and do the practical exercises he suggests, then you'll be making massive changes in your workplace.Transformational stuff!

Luckily I'm not one of those, and this book has really struck home. Pink focuses begins by focusing on describing existing management processes as a carrot and stick reward system having evolved workplace of monotonous, undesirable tasks. He introduces the work of a number of social scientists and management theorists, as well as the results of their experiments both in the lab and in the work place. He posits that today's left-brain worked is better ""managed"" through intrinsic motivation, which he defines as being best facilitated when people are given Autonomy in how they do their work, given the tools to strive for Mastery in their skills, and working towards a Purpose, or a greater good. My brain has been quite active for a few days now, working out missteps I've made in the past along these guidelines, and coming up with ideas as to how to better handle similar situations in the future. It also has a quick but interesting section on fallacies in using reward systems as motivation for educating our children. Definitely a fantastic book, borrow mine! "
22,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2697389-amanda,4,"Amanda's Informal Notes:Surprisingly, pretty darn fascinating. I don't usually read a lot of non-fiction, so it took me a bit to get used to the author's style, but I'm glad I pushed through because Drive gave me some great food for thought:-So for hundreds of years, businesses have been modeled around the idea that people don't have any inherent motivation to work. To keep your workforce productive, you have to reward employees for good behavior (i.e. money and recognition) and punish them for bad (reprimands and firing).-But science is demonstrating that humans possess a powerful third drive that Pink calls ""intrinsic motivation."" In a nutshell, people (and monkeys for that matter) solve puzzles because it's fun. Finding the answer is a reward in itself, which makes perfect sense if you think about it.-Unfortunately, blanket application of the business world's carrot-and-stick theory can even harm our intrinsic desire to work and create. It's like when I tried Interior Design; once you turned it into work, it sucked all the fun out of it.-Of course, we all require some basic amount of money/comfort (what Pink calls ""hygiene factors"") in our jobs. He says employers should satisfy these needs enough to take them off the table, but beyond that, if they really want motivated workers, they should better support employees' intrinsic drive. I'd definitely rather take a basic amount of money to do something I really enjoy than a ton of money to do something I hate.-Pink also points out how technology has removed the necessity for a lot of monotony in our jobs. Because the mindless stuff can be automated, people are left with the complex tasks. As a result, all of our jobs are requiring more creativity. His example was accountants before and after Excel.-He proposes that most people want to work hard and do a good job, and businesses should make policies based on THAT majority- not punish everyone because of the small percentage that would take advantage.-In Pink's words, ""People need autonomy over task (what they do), time (when they do it), team (who they do it with), and technique (how they do it)."" Sounds nice, right?-He gives several examples of companies with extremely flexible schedules or that set aside time for each employee to pursue their own projects and how everyone has profited from those decisions. Some of these ideas seem to really only apply to the software world, but several really could be implemented almost anywhere.-Finally, Pink thinks to be most successful, we should maximize ""flow,"" those times when your abilities are perfectly matched to any challenges and you completely lose track of time. The first thing that came to mind is when I'm doing crafty projects, but I feel it sometimes at work when I'm really interested in what I'm doing.All in all, a really interesting book. I hope my company takes note. :)"
23,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"An intriguing investigation of the factors that motivate people. Pink shows that science has learned much about motivation, but business and education still follow outdated models. The old systems of rewards and punishments are no longer effective for today’s non-routine, creative, conceptual work. People need a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Pink divides human history into three “operating systems” of motivation:Motivation 1.0: People are driven by their biological urges: hunger, thirst, sex, survival.Motivation 2.0: People are given external rewards and punishment to enforce compliance; the “carrot and stick” model.Motivation 3.0: People are empowered to follow their intrinsic motivation and desire for purpose. The goal is engagement; to achieve flow, the state of being “in the zone”, and mastery.The book refers to several management styles that have developed since the Industrial Revolution. It then explains the three factors of motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. It explores autonomy further, explaining that people should be free to choose their task (work), time (schedule), technique (work style), and team (people they work with).Pink divides people into Type X (extrinsically motivated) and Type I (intrinsically motivated), and describes research showing that Type I people are generally more successful. He compares “purpose goals” and “profit goals”, and explains that people striving for purpose have higher self-esteem and lower anxiety and stress than those pursuing profit.Rewards are a major theme in the book. Pink shows that “if, then” rewards (“if you do this, then you’ll be rewarded”) may be effective in the short term, but are detrimental in the long term. In their place, he recommends “now that” rewards: “now that you’ve done this, you’re being rewarded”. These responsive rewards play off a person’s intrinsic motivation rather than wielding extrinsic motivators like a whip.I liked the point that rewards can turn play into work, but focusing on mastery can turn work into play. Thus, a hobby that turns into a job often loses its appeal. Alternatively, a person who truly loves his work and strives to master it finds himself “in the zone”, enjoying it as much as he would a hobby.I recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding human motivation and what drives workers, volunteers, hobbyists, and schoolchildren."
24,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18333933-klinta,4,"This book was a really exciting read, it covered research into motivational field and opinions and theories of experts in psychology and business. It is rare that a textbook type of book captions my attention so much that I don't really want to read anything else, but this one did so. In many of the situations and models described I saw myself, my flaws and actually got motivated to change something in my life. I don't really know, how long the motivation will last though. What also helped is that in the book many people's research I have learned about in my educational studies were covered, which helped me with the read and also made me see that education is developing and evolving and at some point will be able to at least partially adjust to the modern society's needs and psychology. It was a slow read for me, because I read it on my way in train and that gave me the opportunity to think a lot about what I read. But because of that the summary at the end of the book was really boring for me. Wanted to snatch away a star for that, but decided to stay on four stars. "
25,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"I went in expecting this to be a pop psych book, similar to Gladwell. I wanted a book on why humans do things the way they do, and how we analyze problems and make decisions. But this is a pop business book. I don’t care for business self-help books, so take my review with a grain of salt.Pink talks about intrinsic motivation vs. extrinsic motivation, and a growth mindset vs. a static mindset. Some good studies are thrown in, showing that the carrot/stick methods of motivation only work a small percentage of the time. He has good suggestions for creating better environments for coworkers.But it’s not my kind of book."
26,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,3,"In his essay about the spate of new books dealing with the effects of the internet on culture in a recent New Yorker (http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics...), Adam Gopnik separates observers into three camps: the Never-Betters, the Better-Nevers, and the Ever-Wasers. Daniel Pink, as readers of his previous ‘A Whole New Mind,’ will guess, is a Never-Better type, seriously optimistic about our potential and the odds of achieving it. While ‘Drive’ isn’t specifically about what the Internet is doing to us, it is about the kind of motivation we’ll need in a new age that has come about largely because of online technology. If you can handle Pink’s relentless positivity, he makes a compelling case for reconfiguring the reward and punishment paradigm we’ve been using to get work done. Pink suggests changing the goal itself to solving problems and creating solutions. That goal will be realized when workers feel their work has purpose, and when they are given the independence to achieve competence in their own way.We need to throw out ‘Motivation 2.0’ for a new ‘operating system,’ one based on ‘Type I’ behavior, rather than ‘Type X.’ Type I types are ‘fueled more by intrinsic desires that extrinsic ones.’ Type X types are dinosaurs left over from the Industrial Age mentality exemplified by assembly-line advocate Frederick Winslow Taylor, and the behaviorist school mindset personified by B.F. Skinner. Such a revolution is grounded in work done by newer psychologists, particularly Edward Deci. Deci’s studies indicate that ‘if-then’ motivators for puzzle solvers actually result in subjects performing at a lower level than those who were offered no recompense other than the joy of solving puzzles. Deci, working with Richard Ryan, developed self-determination theory. Countering behaviorist ideas that our actions are merely the result of responses to positive or negative reinforcements, Deci and Ryan propose that what we do happens because of ‘three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness.’Pink is a staunch disciple of that philosophy. He presents his case in a most entertaining fashion. As in ‘A Whole New Mind,’ he does a wonderful job of synthesizing disparate strands of evidence, and gives readers lots of great ideas for future exploration.A couple of issues that are glossed over, however, concern me. One is economics. Pink acknowledges that on a basic level, intrinsic motivation is not enough compensation for labor. Workers should get fair wages. Indeed, he encourages employers to ‘pay more than average.’ But he never says what is fair, just that it is less than you might think. Our society runs because it has an infrastructure that is running—although these days you might wonder about that. Many infrastructure jobs are mundane—moving things in, taking things out, keeping the conduits open. People who do that work are needed, but they are often not paid well. Is that fair?Again, Pink doesn’t deny that there are routine, boring, but necessary jobs that justify ‘if-then’ rewards. He just doesn’t pay too much attention to them, or how much they are worth. Instead, he investigates creative businesses which employ progressive policies.Far more exciting. Sometimes, though, someone’s got to take out the trash.The other issue is educational. When I went through SF State’s teaching credential program a few years back, the emphasis was definitely on intrinsic motivation with students. In my subsequent work as a tutor, however, I’ve worked with many special needs kids. I’ve come to the conclusion that Special Education has a distinctly different take on extrinsic motivators—far less critical—than Regular Ed. Why is that and why does it never seem to be addressed? There are certain areas of behavior where we haven’t yet completely escaped the Skinner box. "

I certainly enjoy the autonomy my job currently provides and am sympathetic to a book whose agenda is to propagate such.Keyword is propagate, as this book quickly became an annoying parade of unoriginal ideas wrapped in an idealism that didn't honestly deal with the challenges of ""setting your workforce free."" There's been a lot of intelligent thought on human organization and motivation that isn't usefully dismissed by asserting that ""management"" is akin to a swearword. Purpose, Autonomy, Mastery - and Flow...yep, I get it and I recognize it and I want it...I wanted it before reading this book, and I don't feel this book really helped me get closer to it or helps me meaningfully implement such in the workplace."

Me as an HR practitioner would agree with many aspects of this book's arguments especially in term of people motivation factors, performance methodology and purpose, people's engagement and disengagement, corporate culture, etc. The arguments he gave look beneficial, efficient and FANCY as well! Although he underpinned and strengthened his arguments with scientific cases, methods and facts, but from my point of view it is bit difficult to implement them in all industries and corporations especially if we consider the differences in what we call (PESTEL) aspects. Overall, this book is not a typical as many business and self development books, there are many insightful and unique ideas we all could implement them in our day to day life or in corporate level.The book is gonna be a good tool for decision makers, leaders or any one who supervised employees in workplace.

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

Extrinsic motivators (rewards) vs intrinsic motivators was intriguing: research has shown that external rewards cannot sustain motivation, whether in school or work settings. I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
34,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"

I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "

Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
38,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

The only problem is that: there is a lot of repetitive ideas in this book. And on a more personal note, I don't have a business. I'm more of a potato tbh. So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them? This is the book for you.

41,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

42,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
43,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

46,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
47,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

53,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3721054-jo,4,This book made me think and think differently about some things. I loved how psychological research was used to enhance the elements in this book. I didn't find the tips in the back to be to helpful. I already work in an environment where I am encouraged to think and grow.

57,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""
58,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,3,"I decided to pick up this book for two reasons:1. I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
59,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!). There you go. I finished the book for you. You now have my permission to add it to your remarkable ""reads"" list. by Pseudo GoodReads author Vonia."
60,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,2,"To give this book the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure when it came out it was positively groundbreaking. Unfortunately, 11 years later, concepts such as flow, grit, and mission statements that mean something have become so ubiquitous in the business/psychology world that I kept double checking to make sure I really hadn't read this one already...because it sure felt like I had.Every case study, story, and 'ground-breaking' new concept is familiar to the point of being hackneyed. And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."
61,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5097362-fiona-leonard,4,"As a homeschooling, self employed person, this book didn't come as a huge surprise, but it is one that I really enjoyed. I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

This book was such a disappointment. Watch the talk and read the first chapter. Then bail before his incessant jargon rehashing studies other researchers have conducted numbs your mind."
63,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36521173-unchong-berkey,3,"Interesting read that challenges how we traditionally think about what motivates us. Extrinsic motivators (rewards) vs intrinsic motivators was intriguing: research has shown that external rewards cannot sustain motivation, whether in school or work settings. I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
64,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
65,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."
66,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"I recommend THIS REVIEW for a description of this book that's better than any review that I might write.This book describes how the usual measures taken to promote motivation in people can have results opposite of what was intended. These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "
67,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,1,"Mediocre at best. Like many pop science writers, Pink regurgitates a bunch of other people's work and tries to put his own spin on it. Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
68,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

The only problem is that: there is a lot of repetitive ideas in this book. And on a more personal note, I don't have a business. I'm more of a potato tbh. So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them? This is the book for you.

71,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

72,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
73,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

76,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
77,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

87,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""

I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
89,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
94,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"

I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "

Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."

Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

102,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
103,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "
104,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5218820-becca-altimier,5,"Reading Daniel Pink’s DRiVE took me a lot longer than a 200 page book normally would. I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

106,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
107,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it!

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way.

These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

117,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""

In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes!

I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
119,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!). There you go. I finished the book for you. You now have my permission to add it to your remarkable ""reads"" list. by Pseudo GoodReads author Vonia."
120,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,2,"To give this book the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure when it came out it was positively groundbreaking. Unfortunately, 11 years later, concepts such as flow, grit, and mission statements that mean something have become so ubiquitous in the business/psychology world that I kept double checking to make sure I really hadn't read this one already...because it sure felt like I had.Every case study, story, and 'ground-breaking' new concept is familiar to the point of being hackneyed. And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."
122,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5123231-irene-mchugh,2,"After watching Pink’s TED Talk years ago, I enthusiastically added Drive to my list of books to read. This book was such a disappointment. Watch the talk and read the first chapter. Then bail before his incessant jargon rehashing studies other researchers have conducted numbs your mind."
123,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36521173-unchong-berkey,3,"Interesting read that challenges how we traditionally think about what motivates us. Extrinsic motivators (rewards) vs intrinsic motivators was intriguing: research has shown that external rewards cannot sustain motivation, whether in school or work settings. I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
124,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
125,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "
127,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,1,"Mediocre at best. Like many pop science writers, Pink regurgitates a bunch of other people's work and tries to put his own spin on it. Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
128,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away
129,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35852954-nadia-awadi,3,"This is a really good book as an introduction to 'intrinsic motivation' and how we can use it, to better the business world and our lives. The only problem is that: there is a lot of repetitive ideas in this book. And on a more personal note, I don't have a business. I'm more of a potato tbh. So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them? This is the book for you.

131,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

132,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
133,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "
134,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5218820-becca-altimier,5,"Reading Daniel Pink’s DRiVE took me a lot longer than a 200 page book normally would. I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

136,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
137,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

147,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""
148,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,3,"I decided to pick up this book for two reasons:1. I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
149,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

Unfortunately, 11 years later, concepts such as flow, grit, and mission statements that mean something have become so ubiquitous in the business/psychology world that I kept double checking to make sure I really hadn't read this one already...because it sure felt like I had.Every case study, story, and 'ground-breaking' new concept is familiar to the point of being hackneyed. And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."
151,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5097362-fiona-leonard,4,"As a homeschooling, self employed person, this book didn't come as a huge surprise, but it is one that I really enjoyed. I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

Extrinsic motivators (rewards) vs intrinsic motivators was intriguing: research has shown that external rewards cannot sustain motivation, whether in school or work settings. I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
154,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
155,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "

Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."

Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

162,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
163,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "
164,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5218820-becca-altimier,5,"Reading Daniel Pink’s DRiVE took me a lot longer than a 200 page book normally would. I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

166,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
167,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it!

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way.

These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

177,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""

I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
179,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

This book was such a disappointment. Watch the talk and read the first chapter. Then bail before his incessant jargon rehashing studies other researchers have conducted numbs your mind."
183,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36521173-unchong-berkey,3,"Interesting read that challenges how we traditionally think about what motivates us. Extrinsic motivators (rewards) vs intrinsic motivators was intriguing: research has shown that external rewards cannot sustain motivation, whether in school or work settings. I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
184,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
185,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "
187,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,1,"Mediocre at best. Like many pop science writers, Pink regurgitates a bunch of other people's work and tries to put his own spin on it. Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
188,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away
189,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35852954-nadia-awadi,3,"This is a really good book as an introduction to 'intrinsic motivation' and how we can use it, to better the business world and our lives. The only problem is that: there is a lot of repetitive ideas in this book. And on a more personal note, I don't have a business. I'm more of a potato tbh. So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them? This is the book for you.

Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

192,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
193,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

196,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."

People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

198,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"What motivates people?Daniel Pink takes a real close look at what business and society has always thought about motivation. He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"
199,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,2,"I can't do it. I read half of it and I just can't bring myself to finish it. Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead. Drive is yet another business book that will go down in the regurgitated, superficial ash-heaps of history."

207,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""
208,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,3,"I decided to pick up this book for two reasons:1. I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
209,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

Unfortunately, 11 years later, concepts such as flow, grit, and mission statements that mean something have become so ubiquitous in the business/psychology world that I kept double checking to make sure I really hadn't read this one already...because it sure felt like I had.Every case study, story, and 'ground-breaking' new concept is familiar to the point of being hackneyed. And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
214,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
215,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "
217,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,1,"Mediocre at best. Like many pop science writers, Pink regurgitates a bunch of other people's work and tries to put his own spin on it. Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
218,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them?

Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

222,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
223,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

226,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."

People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it!

These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead.

237,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""

I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
239,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

244,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"

I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "

Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
248,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away
249,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35852954-nadia-awadi,3,"This is a really good book as an introduction to 'intrinsic motivation' and how we can use it, to better the business world and our lives. The only problem is that: there is a lot of repetitive ideas in this book. And on a more personal note, I don't have a business. I'm more of a potato tbh. So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them? This is the book for you.

251,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

252,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
253,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

256,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
257,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"

Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead. Drive is yet another business book that will go down in the regurgitated, superficial ash-heaps of history."

267,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""
268,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,3,"I decided to pick up this book for two reasons:1. I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
269,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!).

Unfortunately, 11 years later, concepts such as flow, grit, and mission statements that mean something have become so ubiquitous in the business/psychology world that I kept double checking to make sure I really hadn't read this one already...because it sure felt like I had.Every case study, story, and 'ground-breaking' new concept is familiar to the point of being hackneyed. And again, I'm willing to say that possibly they are because his book was so successful it made them so. But at the end of the day, I walked away feeling like I learned nothing new."

I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvA..."

I most appreciated the section about what people really need/want in order to flourish in a work (or school) environment: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The most content individuals at work are those that experience all 3. "
274,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Incredible book on the ""evolution of motivation"" and what really drives high performance. The book starts by exploring the basic human needs as motivation, to eat and to procreate. The author calls this ""Motivation 1.0"". Now, eventually as civilizations progressed we upgraded to acknowledge external motivations, such as rewards and punishments, ""Motivation 2.0."". So far most businesses, schools, institutions and people use rewards and punishments to ensure things are being done on time. Sadly even today most people believe things like money are the best way to motivate others. And in this book you'll discover that money is a motivator only to a certain point until our basic needs are met. However, what the author discovered is a third drive that motivates people, one that is actually hampered by rewards and punishments. So in this book you'll discover that new way of managing people. The new model the author calls Motivation 3.0 has three essential elements:1. Autonomy: the desire to direct our own lives.2. Mastery: the urge to get better and better at something that matters.3. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.Once these 3 needs are met we become intrinsically motivated to do great work. And at this point money and external motivators will actually worsen our performance. The book gives great example of companies in the 21st century (such as Google) that incorporate this new style of motivation with great success. In essence this book is a must read for every person. Even if your job isn't managerial you life is. Being able to truly understand what drives those around you is critical for your and their success. Highly recommended!"
275,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"I think the whole book could've been wrapped up in one or two chapters. I really get what Author is trying to say and it is important that Governments, Corporations understand that not everything that their employee (or a person) does for them is because they get paid for it. In fact, I personally believe that most of us deep down do realize that point because otherwise Human Civilization would not have come as far as it has come today. (Look at any major discoveries, inventions of past few centuries.) I do strongly agree about Author's view of Autonomy and how it positively affects the businesses in the long run. But I have also seen people misuse Autonomy and independence. Strangely, Author did not elaborate much on explaining the other side.Overall, the book is good in terms of the message its trying to convey but somehow it didn't engage me as much as I would've liked it to. Many chapters actually end up repeating more or less the same thing. I think it's a decent one time read. Do not read this book expecting it would start making a difference to your life from next day."

These unintended consequences have long been demonstrated by psychologists, but businesses and schools have been slow to make use of this information. All the time I was listening to this book I was thinking about how difficult it is to change social situations to take advantage of the information discussed in this book. "
277,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,1,"Mediocre at best. Like many pop science writers, Pink regurgitates a bunch of other people's work and tries to put his own spin on it. Unfortunately, nothing in this book is new or even surprising, despite Pink's assertion to the contrary. Pink alternately sneers at the idea of ""empowerment"" then goes on to basically advocate the exact same thing.The worst part is that the book is written in a salesman's voice. Unsurprisingly, Pink has a whole 'kit' to help people discover their own internal motivation. I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money to spout this bullshit in front of large corporate audiences."
278,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,Good book but too long and repetitive and with not that much insight. Some insights:- They found that there is a 3rd type of drive called intrinsic reward and it trumps all other external motivations. Intrinsic motivation needs the right type of environment to survive. For example: when money is used as an external reward for some activity the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity- If you're going to reward your team with a dinner party don't do it the next time too or else they'll be expecting it and once they expect a reward their intrinsic reward system goes away

So there were passages that did not benefit me that much. If you ever want to start a business or know why some people like running for the hell of it, and how could you become one of them?

Pink “Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us"" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.  Positives:1.	Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.2.	Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.3.	The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation. 4.	Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. “Too many organizations—not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well—still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.” 5.	This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, “The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.”6.	The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. “When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating.” Great stuff! 7.	The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. “…for Type X’s, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I’s, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus”. 8.	Understanding Type I personalities. “Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.”9.	Understanding the value of autonomy. “A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude”.10.	The four essentials. “And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy—in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with11.	Understanding the value of mastery. ”Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one’s way in today’s economy”. 12.	The three laws of mastery: it’s a mindset, is a pain, and it’s an asymptote.13.	The purpose of motive. “Motivation 3.0 doesn’t reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life—goals, words, and policies”. 14.	The book inspired me to look at some of the “big questions” from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that’s why I read.15.	The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.16.	The toolkit and its applications to the real world.17.	The philosophy from the seven business gurus.18.	The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.19.	Links to Notes worked great.Negatives:1.	The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn’t confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author’s point of view. It’s my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold. 2.	The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.3.	Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists? 4.	The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor’s recent book, “My Beloved World” she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed. 5.	Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it’s much more complex than that. 6.	The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas. 7.	Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones. 8.	Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge. In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It’s provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!Further suggestions: “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Mindset” and “Self-theories” by Carol Dweck, “The Art of Possibility” by Rosamund Stone Zander, “The Talent Code” by Daniel Coyle, “Why We Do What We Do” by Edward L.

282,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"There is a fall-out to having a ‘Kindle Unlimited’ subscription on Amazon. One comes across many books that one can read without paying extra. That is how I ended up reading this book even though I am not all that interested in the subject of ‘Motivation’. I had a cursory browse through it and found that the writing style was breezy. The experiments and their results seemed explained in an accessible way. On top of it, the author has summarized the essence of the book at the end. There is a brief summary in 140 characters and a somewhat lengthier one as well. Finally, there is the title claiming ‘the surprising truth about what motivates us’. Such claims always intrigue me. Past experience tells me that often they end up as no surprises. For example, recently, I read a book which claimed in the title ‘surprising truths on how we learn’. There were explanations of new innovations in learning. They turned to be methods practised in our school system in India even in the 1960s. Still, there was the lurking interest in me to find out if I can learn something new about Motivation here.So, what is this new truth about Motivation that author Daniel Pink talks about? He says that survival needs such as food, sex and security motivated humans in the early stages. Then, till about the 20th century, a ‘rewards and punishments’ approach motivated us. Now, in the 21st century, Pink says that we have a drive to learn, to create new things, and to better the world. The 'rewards and punishments' approach cannot nurture this drive. What we need is ‘Intrinsic motivation’ rather than extrinsic rewards. Hence, the new approach to motivation in Enterprises should encompass three essential elements. They are:(1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives(2) Mastery—the desire to get better and better at something that matters to us(3) Purpose—the longing to do something larger than ourselves.One cannot disagree with the approach to Motivation that Pink says we need now. I am sure it will help in motivating people. But I have a problem calling it ‘a new approach’ or ‘a surprising truth about Motivation’. In fact, what the author calls as ‘21st century work’ is not even something special to the 21st century either. Let us look deeper into each of these contentions.The author says that tasks in Enterprises are either Algorithmic or Heuristic. Algorithmic tasks are those where you do the same thing over and over in a certain well-defined way. Heuristic tasks are those where there are no set instructions to follow. You have to come up with something new every time. According to the book, 70% of all jobs in the US now are Heuristic. We need intrinsic motivation to accomplish Heuristic tasks.Yet, heuristic jobs are not a new 21st century phenomenon. Engineering, technological and research organizations have always done work that is heuristic. The work environment in these institutions have always incorporated Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy has been a partial feature of even algorithmic workplaces in the West since the 1970s. For example, in Australia in the 1980s in the IT departments of industries, Flexitime options were not uncommon. It gave greater autonomy over one's working life. Since the advance of Telecommunications in the 1990s, many workplaces allow telecommuting from home once or even twice a week. Enterprises have paid for employees to acquire higher qualifications even as they keep their jobs. So, Autonomy and Mastery have existed well in the 20th century itself. One can agree that it will become more ubiquitous in the present if 70% of the jobs are heuristic. As for the third element in Motivation - Purpose -, it need not always be something lofty or altruistic or larger than ourselves. The book underestimates the importance of Money in our working lives. A Purpose to make more money has always been there in our working lives and has always been a key motivator. It doesn't follow that one is crazy after money in such cases. People live in societies and they are influenced by its values. We live in a rich, capitalist society in the US. Money is a crucial marker in the US for social status, success, self-esteem, security and power. Money is important to achieve many goals of workers, as family men or women, as parents, husbands or wives. With the achievement of certain goals, the needs change and a new Purpose emerges. So, the need for Money evolves with our own personal development. Most workers use the money they make at work to meet other goals outside work. For instance, the goal of doing something larger than ourselves outside of work. The author says that money as an incentive for Motivation can be taken off the table when Motivation based on Intrinsic needs assumes center-stage. Yet, I can think of many instances where this does not seem to hold . In Silicon Valley start-ups, the job often provides the three elements of Autonomy, Mastery and sometimes, Purpose. Many senior employees are often successful already in their professional and financial lives. Still, after working in three start-ups, I have never come across a situation where money was ‘off the table’. Engineers, who are worth 7-figure sums, would not sign on to work unless their stock compensation reflects the value of what they feel they bring to the company. It is a key aspect to their motivation to work in a start-up because it is a reflection of their place in the hierarchy of the company. We see elsewhere in Sports as well where Money plays a key role in Sports Professionals’ lives, in spite of them having money in plenty. Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, was caught using a performance-enhancing drug. By then, she had already completed the coveted career-Grand Slam. She was also worth more than a hundred million dollars in endorsements. Going by this book, she should be playing only for Mastery and love for the game and not for Money. It is so with many Olympic athletes as well, who get caught using drugs. Lance Armstrong, the racing cyclist and seven-times winner of Tour de France is another example. The extrinsic incentive of many more millions in endorsements is still very much at work here. Their examples show that it is difficult to specify the point at which money can be taken ‘off the table’. The book does a good job of elucidating Motivation and makes us look at it in a different way. Though many researchers have contributed to the study of Motivation in the past, the author invokes only a select few in support of his theories. In today’s world of jobless growth and neo-liberal economics, there is also the criticism in some quarters about the emphasis on Intrinsic motivation as a ploy by the Corporate class to get workers to do more for less money!"
283,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15448908-sfran,4,"As children, we are motivated by our curiosity and need to learn about and explore new things. As adults, the way our society is configured brings us to believe that our number one motivator (number one “drive”) is money. Or is it?Daniel Pink explores the human psychology of why we do what we do and what exactly makes us want to do what we do. We are born with an innate sense of adventure and curiosity, but we seem to forget this as we grow older.Pink starts off with an interesting scenario. Suppose you’re back in time interviewing an economist from 1995 and you ask him a question about the future: “I’m going to tell you about two encyclopedias and you have to pick which will be more successful in 2010. The first was just put out by Microsoft, the second will not come from a professional company, but from individuals who write and edit articles for fun. All work is done for free.” Which encyclopedia do you think the economist would have chosen? As we all know today, Encarta eventually fell way behind Wikipedia. This tells us that money isn’t necessarily the X factor or the secret ingredient that makes us work harder or better, for that matter. There must be some other special fuel that gets our motors running at top speed, but what could that be? Pink explains that researches have indeed shown that both external rewards and punishments can work well for algorithmic tasks, but not so well for heuristic tasks. Money, or any other external reward, can motivate people when work isn’t necessarily enjoyable or doesn’t involve using creativity. In these cases, people need to be coaxed with either rewards or punishments.So why did Wikipedia work? People in this case were self-motivated. There is no one sitting around telling them what to write, when to do write it, or how to write it. Routine not-so-interesting jobs require direction, while non-routine interesting jobs depend on self-direction.Carrots and sticks (a.k.a. rewards and punishments) often don’t work. They can: extinguish intrinsic motivation (the reward becomes the key reason to do it and destroys the intrinsic enjoyment of the task itself); diminish performance; crush creativity (the bonus/reward prevents wider perspectives to be taken into account, reducing potential creativity); crowd out good behavior, encourage unethical behavior, create addictions (study of drug abuse can be applied to extrinsic motivators – the more frequently they are given, the more we expect them), once they are taken away performance plummets; foster short-term thinking. They can only be effective for routine tasks, when there is little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. Even better if the “why” of the task is explained and if autonomy is given over how it can be completed.Pink distinguishes Type X from Type I behavior. Type X is fueled more by extrinsic desires and concerned more with external rewards than intrinsic ones. Type I, on the contrary, concerns itself less with external rewards and more with the inherent satisfaction of an activity. People and businesses should focus more on Type I behavior, rather than Type X. We are born with Type I behavior and shouldn’t lose it over “carrots and sticks”.You might finally ask, what is our “drive”? Pink identifies three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. The author brings an example of time management. By letting people come to work whenever they feel more productive, they actually get more done and with better quality. Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: task (what you want to do), time (when you want to do it), technique (how you want to do it), team (with whom you want to do it). All these ingredients lead to really real autonomy, which leads to engagement and produces mastery.Mastery, the second drive, is the desire to continually improve something that matters and feel fulfilled. Only engagement can produce mastery and the pursuit of mastery is essential in today’s economy, although the work place, more often than not, doesn’t enable engagement and forgets about mastery. Mastery has three essential laws: mastery is a mindset, what people believe shapes what they can achieve; mastery in pain, it takes “grit” to overcome the inevitable setbacks along the way; mastery is asymptote, total mastery is never really reached (which keeps people on a life long journey to keep pushing and bettering themselves more and more).Finally, purpose – the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Humans by nature seek purpose in everything they do, although most businesses/organizations to not have a motivating purpose behind them. This today is slowly changing. The new “purpose motive” in businesses expresses itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self interest; in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. Hopefully, the move to accompany purpose maximization along side with profit maximization will rejuvenate our economy.This book definitely gave good insight about the hidden (or forgotten) truths of motivation. What Pink seems to forget is that not all people are born with creative minds and therefore need a structured environment to complete routine/algorithmic tasks. Some wouldn’t feel comfortable with too much autonomy and would need the rigor of the work place. Autonomy should be given as tasks become harder and need more innovative ideas to solve them.  "

I couldn’t stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I’d write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that’s probably frowned upon. After the fact, I’m really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.Daniel Pink, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates UsThe book is subtitled “The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us” and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I’d argue education) management and leadership haven’t caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that– the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you’re reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.“Management isn’t about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It’s about creating conditions for people to do their best work.”This can be difficult to grasp, whether we’re supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training– but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks– things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.This piece has huge implications for my own work in student involvement and leadership. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something — in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won’t argue that. But if that’s what we’re using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we’re wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.“We’re designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren’t when we’re clamoring for validation from others, but when we’re listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.”I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I’ve had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I’ve read recently– and it has real application to the work we’re doing. Whether you’re a supervisor or being supervised, there is a lot to be learned from DRiVE."

286,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,2,"Shoot, my life would be better if the last two thirds of this book had never been written.If this book only consisted of the first third, I would be able to give it a high rating and a nice review: this book is a little bit short, I would say, but it talks about an interesting, non-intuitive aspect of human psychology -- an aspect that has been ignored by significant fields like economics and psychology. We clearly recognize that there are two large drives that motivate people: the first is biological, the urge to drink, eat, procreate, etc; the second is external rewards and punishments, such as going to work to get paid, avoiding speeding in front of cops, etc. But, people are definitely motivated to spend huge amounts of time on activities that don't seem to satisfy either of those drives. I'm sure you're familiar with some examples, such as people spending large amounts of time playing games that don't satisfy biological urges, and don't give any real external reward. Even if you aren't a gamer, chances are you've spent time playing Tetris or Farmville, or even participating in some other type of activity that seems enjoyable without giving any direct external benefit.Not only do people seem to be motivated to participate in activities that don't satisfy basic urges, and don't provide a direct external reward -- but, surprisingly, people often find that activities in this third category actually lose their appeal when they become connected to an external reward. Find an activity that someone enjoys -- say, collecting achievements in a game -- and tell them you'll pay them to do it. In the short term, they'll appreciate it, and maybe even do a better job. But take away the reward for performance, or even just wait for a while so that the reward becomes expected, and their enjoyment won't just go back to its original level: chances are, they'll start to dislike the activity.That would have been my review. Unfortunately, after the book talks about this phenomenon and some of its implications, it turns into a sort of self-help / leadership how-to book. It provides a number of example strategies and examples of how to achieve goals and get co-workers and subordinates to be more effective. Maybe there are some useful lessons to learn, and having a better understanding of human psychology is useful in dealing with people, but the tone of this book simply sounds like a fad-of-the-month management book, and it detracts from the book's overall quality."
287,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48109562-stephanie-thoma,4,"A lot of the findings in Drive favor valuing people’s need for intrinsically valuable life experiences while respecting our need to engage in things for purely altruistic reasons. People tend to be more motivated by the prospect of more creative work than a raise. Other takeaways:- a study of blood drives shows that monetarily incentivizing a drive diminishes turnout, while giving people pto to donate blood allowed turnout to stay the same as it was without the possibility of explicit compensation- a study of fining parents for picking up their kids late resulted in more late parents- the parents previously wanted to relieve the teachers, but then rationalized that they would get paid for their extra time and took them up on the implicit offering- don’t incentivize with a bonus or prize, but offer it after a job well done sparingly so the motivation remains intrinsic - “being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don’t feel like doing them.” - Julius Erving - you can get really close, but you can never touch it= mastery- book recommendation: good work: when excellence and ethics meet by Howard Gardner, mihaly csikszentmihalyi, and William Damon - most innovation comes from letting the mind wander, the case for google’s 20% time/ atlassian’s fedex days becoming standard in the workplace- be results vs process driven.

288,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"What motivates people?Daniel Pink takes a real close look at what business and society has always thought about motivation. He throws away the carrot and stick approach of parents, teachers, and bosses everywhere and suggests 3 true elements of motivation:""*Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives*Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves""Pink uses some interesting examples to get his point across.I found myself reflecting on what motivates me and found that Pink has me pegged.For most people who get up every day for school or work to get that diploma or paycheck, life is some carrot/stick and some of Pink's ideas. It is great when it can crossover and you can have both, which is what Pink really focuses on.I do think there are some people motivated by little; they just want to do as little as possible in terms of thinking and working. Maybe Pink could write a book for them about how great it is to direct your own life, master something, and look beyond your own life. No, they probably wouldn't read it! They are too busy trying to figure out how to do nothing!Life is better when you are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose!"
289,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,2,"I can't do it. I read half of it and I just can't bring myself to finish it. Drive started off strong with descriptions of what gets people motivated to work in a meaningful way. I took notes, got some good ideas and was impressed that Pink, who is a Business Book Author was seemingly digging up some novel ideas.Then came the case studies. 3M, Google, Atlassian, FedEx, Herman Miller and Toyota are all there. These companies are, if you've read any business books you'll know this, among THE quintessential business book examples. There are how many companies in the world? Millions? Apparently though, of all the millions of other companies, These Companies and maybe 10 or 20 others are the only ones that are innovative enough to be profiled in books. It's either that or the authors of business books are too lazy to find any other examples and instead will mindlessly and incessantly reuse them as fodder for whatever shred of an idea they might be trying to expand into a book.Avoid it, read Thinking Fast and Slow instead. Drive is yet another business book that will go down in the regurgitated, superficial ash-heaps of history."

297,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"Fine book. Take-away boils down to if-then rewards (operant conditioning)working well for short-term, but poorly for long-term motivation. Any long-termmotivation must be intrinsic. Whenever you start rewarding with reward incentives, you run the risk of removing natural gravitation toward an activity, i.e. you pay your kid to mow the lawn once, and you'll have to do it forever. Basic extrinsic rewards like pay, working conditions, and job security need to be at a level where you take the issue off the table -- beyond that point, you no longer motivate people further this way. The main elements in an environment conducive of intrinsic motivation are: autonomy; you feel in charge of what you're doing, relatedness; you feel what you're working on is important and fits into a bigger picture, and mastery; you feel a sense of progress in a skill.My main criticism of this book is that it's dogmatic. I have a hard time trusting a book that doesn't have a single scenario where extrinsic rewards can be useful. I've certainly seen that as a way to kick-start behaviour. You see people who donate blood for decades, who seem partly motivated by the 'status symbol gifts' you get at certain marks, e.g. 15 years. Isn't this a form of long-term motivation by symbolic extrinsic rewards? Pinker also has this annoying habit of summarizing short chapters on extremely complicated topics in an overly bold my-ideas-explain-this-too way. Example: ""So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs."""
298,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,3,"I decided to pick up this book for two reasons:1. I read Daniel Pink's When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing  and that book changed my life for the better. 2. I saw it on my CEO's desk and I am always fascinated by people in leadership read, so of course I asked to borrow it. In  Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us  Pink sets to talk about motivation and why the old ""carrot and stick"" method will not work. I really enjoyed the all the examples he used as to why monetary rewards will not work and how having money as a form of reward generally lead to lost of motivation, people be unethical etc. I particular loved the candle stick experiment and I do recommend everyone read it. Pink sets out to show that the regardless of the field you work in, people's motivations are intrinsic and not exactly dependant on external factors eg. money or fame. Yes! Rewards can deliver a short term boost-just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few hours. But the effect wears off- and, worse, can reduce a person's long-term motivation...""While enjoyed this read, I do think it could have benefitted from a bit more editing, I found Pink repeated himself a lot and belabored a point unnecessarily. I however loved where he explored the ""what is your sentence"" question. If you are in management, or currently trying to figure out how to keep yourself and your team motivated, I strongly suggest you read this book. "
299,1594488843,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,2,"A book that started out well. Pink writes in a user-friendly, relatable voice, providing us useful information. He comes close to patronizing a few times, but manages to avoid it. The information is mainly theories that can be best categorized under industrial and organizational psychology (shortened in academia to I/O Psychology), or (what I learned it as) occupational psychology. He does this by simplifying or merely expressing in a new way suggestions and theories about why work environments where there are no strict rules and leniency is practiced end up with greater results. Said another way, how to best take advantage of differing personalities it's the workplace. Yes, different personalities should be treated differently by methods that maximize productivity. This is a perfect segue into one of my complaints. Yes, this is information anyone can use, no matter where, what, or how- or even whether- they work. But most of it is most understandably applicable in a very specific working environment- somewhere where a significant number of individuals are working on a collaborative coporate mileu, often communicating, interacting, working together. The material could have greatly benefited from some applicable situations in the domestic part of life. So why is it that I feel exhausted having (finally) finished this book? If I had to garner a guess, I would say it might have to do with how (practically) his entire thesis is already learnt in the first few chapters. The remaining is miniscule details and a rehashing of the same information! A quick scan of Pink's almost 80 other books merely by title are having me believe a lot is duplication and putting a spin on old material. His original title of this thesis? ""Motivation 2.0"". While catchy, all I can think of is how much I needed a true (genuine) motivation to finish reading this book! It took me over a couple months to finish it. And that is saying something, because my procrastination was due to constantly being distracted by other books. Harsh? Not really, says any typical reader. According to Pink, there are three facets of true (genuine, pure) motivation: purpose, as in the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves (the meaning of life?) and mastery, the drive to become our best selves and become better at what it is we do to achieve this purpose, and autonomy, the need to take charge of our lives (screw destiny!). There you go. I finished the book for you. You now have my permission to add it to your remarkable ""reads"" list. by Pseudo GoodReads author Vonia."
