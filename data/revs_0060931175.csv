1,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,2," The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe seemed promising and interesting to me at first glance because of author Lynne McTaggart’s angle. She tries to show that certain questionable topics, such as linking quantum physics to the somewhat New Age-ish idea that every single thing in the universe is connected, can actually be shown to be true via proper scientific research (double-blind, other researchers replicating the methods and getting the same results, etc.). The hypothesis in this case: the existence of the Zero Point Field. “Now that sounds interesting!” is what I thought while picking this up, having read many pseudoscience books over the years – and though occasionally moved and/or interested by the claims in those books, I’d never be able to take them seriously because of the lack of proper scientific methods.But now the question is – is this book by McTaggart really the one to show, with irrefutable evidence, that the Zero Point Field exists? That every single thing in this universe is connected by it, and that it is this particular field that can explain several discrepancies in quantum theory/physics, and/or parapsychological phenomena?Err, no. The first big mistake that McTaggart makes, is not treating the Zero Point Field as an hypothesis at all. Instead of testing the Zero Point Field hypothesis, her approach is rather different: looking up scientific research in which results turned up that can’t be fully explained or simply haven’t yet, and then saying something among the lines of: “Well, look here! Those results (or gaps/discrepancies) can be explained completely and utterly by the existence of the Zero Point Field, because… [followed by explanations concerning the current topic]”. And because the Zero Point Field is the supposed perfect answer, it exists. That is the crux of McTaggart’s reasoning, and there’s definitely something terribly wrong with that, even from a non-scientific point of view.And this approach of hers is such a pity, because the research she references is actually quite engaging, and her explanations of quantum theory are clear and easy to understand. She poses critical questions, especially from a philosophical point of view, and I do think that there’s merit in researching both the Zero Point Field and quantum physics to look for a possible connection. However, the Field is presented as a fact here, which it isn’t, and McTaggart is almost smug in the way she thinks she’s disproving inherent parts of (quantum) physics, which she also isn’t. This is my main problem with this book, even though I think her ideas, theories, philosophical questions, and the scientific research she presents are interesting and definitely worth a look at. I saw a lot of promise in this work, but it didn’t really deliver.Another thing that really bothered me, but might perhaps not be so offensive to others, is McTaggart’s dismissal and inaccurate portrayal of the theory of natural selection. She incorrectly assumes much in her prologue, and even goes so far as to say that both Darwinism and the Newtonian paradigm have completely depleted our self-image and world views, because all we’re doing here is ‘survival of the fittest’, and treating ourselves and those around us as machines. Well, excuse me, but natural selection is not at all completely about ‘survival of the fittest’, and it certainly doesn’t rule out human emotions, empathy, and altruism (i.e. the theory of natural selection doesn’t invalidate my life and/or emotions because I’m simply a ‘gene machine’, for example).Long story short: though I like McTaggart’s core ideas, and admire her journalistic perseverance in gathering such a large amount of knowledge and research, this book simply isn’t truly scientific. So would I recommend this? Well, it is interesting, but just keep in mind that it’s still pseudoscience, and quite biased overall. Take it with a healthy grain of salt."
2,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54708-linda,5,"I'm currently reading this book. It is validating my interest in the quantum field. We create our own reality with our thoughts. And it is only a matter of time until we create either more joy or more pain!Since thoughts become reality, it behooves us to pay attention to what we are thinking!!"
3,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1208349-lorraine,5,"One of the most though-provoking books I've read. The ZPF theories have profound implications for all of us, individually and collectively. McTaggart does an excellent job of translating the scientific data into an understandable package. A must-read for all--those seeking a mental challenge and those searching for spiritual connectivity regardless of their religious affiliation, as well as atheists."
4,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,2,"Um. I had to read this for a class. There's some stuff in here, but you really have to be an incredibly well-trained critical thinker, which I like to think I am, to pull what's worthwhile out. Just note that none of the scientists she interviews is one of the blurbers of this book. Note the latest update was in 2008. Google around for peer-reviewed publications on the Zero Point Field that have been published recently. Note that she often quotes this or that scientist on some cool discovery and then says, ""he was tapping into the Zero Point Field,"" when it doesn't seem at all clear that the scientist him or herself was saying that, or thinking it, or demonstrating it. The only reviewer with any science creds at all is a novelist, Arthur C Clarke. The rest of are of the ilk of The Secret, and What the Bleep Do We Know? So I'd advise extreme caution when reading this book, and would actually advise most people to stay the hell away. If you're all woo-woo about quantum mechanics already, this will further delude you, and if you're a rigid scientist, you'll just laugh, and with many good reasons. There are probably only about 50 non-deluded people who would get anything out of this. Not because they're brilliant but because they might see something useful in here despite all the crap and they might just be willing (or assigned) to wade through it, despite having started laughing at about paragraph 2. "
5,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13038395-kai-zhuang,2,"Note: This is a review of the audiobook narrated by the author. I do not know if the audiobook is exactly the same as the book.This is perhaps the most disappointing (audio) book I have ever read.As a trained systems scientist and bio-engineer with a wide variety of experiences in body-mind and energy disciplines, I am very very interested in the subject matter. To be honest, I went in without too much skepticism. Based on my experience, Qi or Life Force is real, and existing scientific paradigm cannot explain it at all. So I was looking for a real good read that might be thought provoking. Pro:In the book, Lynne presented a lot of researches that she claims to prove that this ""life force"" is zero-point energy. She actually have interviewed a very impressive number of scientists/""pseudo""-scientists and collected a very comprehensive of out of ordinary observations that cannot be explained by existing paradigm. To me, perhaps the most interesting of these are the remote viewing studies. So in a sense, this book is worth a read just for the references McTaggart compiled. Very good journalism in the amount of work she has done... but good journalism ends here.Con:HOWEVER, it is clear that Lynne does not truly understand the scientific method in that she did not even attempt to establish her theory that ""zero-point energy = life force"" as an hypothesis. All she did was collect the references, and then say, ""hey, it sounds to me that zero-point energy can explain this"". This is fine as a popular book, but she is implying that her work is scientific because she got her references from scientists, which is a fallacy. Also, she kept saying ""I can't really understand the science and the scientists had to speak to me in metaphors"". Hmm... so she doesn't really understand what's going on, but after learning of some metaphors that loosely approximate the physics, she has enough understanding to construct a brand new paradigm of the universe. This is probably the most arrogant and ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I understand that she is a journalist and she is supposed to form an opinion. However, making her opinion sounding like scientific truth is bad journalism (of course, this is my opinion :))In summary: this book completely failed to convince me that zero-point energy = life force. the author comes off as arrogant when she takes half-digested information and formulate a grand theory of the universe out of it. this is unfortunate because she had a lot of good references/research. so... perhaps the truth is still out there? "
6,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36087791-emily,2,"If you only read one review, please make it this one! It’s a long one, but it addresses things that I really think you should consider.I want to start by saying that many of the core concepts in this book are things that I already believe or want to believe. That’s mainly why I picked up the book—I’m searching for proof to vindicate my view of the world, that the entire universe is connected in some intangible way, that there’s more to human (and animal) consciousness than just the right mix of hormones and firing neurons, that our intentions can and do have an effect on the outcome of events. I believe in karma, I dabble in tarot cards, I believe—tentatively—in an afterlife. I’m open minded to the ideas, and I’ll admit that I was swept up in the book during my two day marathon of reading it. It’s clear that McTaggart has done a ton of research, and she has an entertaining, readable, well-paced, and convincing way of explaining things.This isn’t necessarily a good thing.McTaggart tries very hard to pass this book off as a scientific literature review, but The Field is nothing of the sort. A literature review has two jobs. The first is to compile, in a thorough and unbiased manner, all of the known data and arguments regarding a particular topic, both in favor of and against it. McTaggart not only cherry-picks and misrepresents the data of experiments, she does the same regarding the circumstances surrounding the lives of these scientists and their experiments. She also completely fails to explain why the scientific community at large has unanimously shunned these scientists and discredited their work. Instead, she chooses to either heavily imply or outright state that there’s some kind of vast conspiracy by the “Establishment” (her word, not mine) that’s suppressing this new information because it doesn’t conform to the appropriate world view.The second job of a literature review is to discuss, analyze and theorize about the data that it has presented. The author completely fails at this, as well. She takes all of these dubious studies and presents them as irrefutable evidence for her made up ideas, which she presents as fact. The key word of the literature review’s job is theorize. The author of a real, well-written scientific review makes logical, educated hypotheses which are presented as possible interpretations of the data. These hypotheses can be tested. The authors don’t pass them off as fact, and they don’t jump to conclusions.It honestly frightens me, the number of 5-star reviews that this book has. Please use your heads, people. Do you really think that if a scientist had actually found real proof that AIDS, a disease that has killed millions of people, could be cured with prayer, that the other hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors who have been trying for thirty years to cure it, wouldn’t sit up and take notice?While reading this book, you may notice an overarching theme of martyrdom. Like Galileo, imprisoned and shunned by society for daring to suggest that the Earth wasn’t the center of the universe, these intrepid scientists at the frontier of human knowledge were prosecuted by their peers for daring to question the Establishment!!! They were oppressed by skeptics!!!! !Listen, people. ‘Skeptic’ isn’t a bad word. Being a skeptic doesn’t mean that you’re closed-minded and refuse to listen to new ideas. It means that you question everything. Approaching the world with skepticism is a good thing, because it means that you can’t easily be fooled. I’m a skeptic, and even though I wanted to believe what this book was telling me, the first thing I did after I finished was to google the author, all of the scientists, and all of the major concepts that were mentioned. What I found was that pretty much everything was grossly misrepresented. I’m not going to hash through all of that here because it’ll take up a lot of space, but I will however mention one fact that absolutely floored me when I read it.Hal Puthoff is a physicist whose theories about zero point energy form the basis for The Field, along with his experiments with self-proclaimed psychics and “remote viewers” Swann & Price. As it turns out, Puthoff spent a decade as a highly involved, high level member of the Church of Scientology. Now, I’m not one to put down others for their involvement in religion. However, Scientology is not a religion. It is, in every sense of the word, a cult. If Puthoff is so gullible that he can be lured in by a cult for ten years, it seem pretty likely that his psychic friends swindled him too.The reason this fact surprised me so much was because McTaggart did not say a word about this in her book. Why not? Because she knew that it would immediately discredit Puthoff to her readers, and for good reason. I’m not trying to push you away from reading this book. It certainly contains some interesting ideas, and I believe it can be valuable to read a book even when everything it says is outright incorrect. And I’m not even saying that all of the ideas represented in this book are necessarily impossible. To reiterate what I’ve already said, I read this book because I’m looking for evidence of things that I already feel to be true. I just want to warn as many people as possible that Lynne McTaggart is an enormous hack and please, please, 
please
 do your research and take everything she says with a huge grain of salt!! "
7,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1824225-michelle,5,"When I picked up this book, I was worried that it was going to turn out to be flaky, new-age stuff with a couple of studies on quantum physics that only tangentially supported the claims being made. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The evidence presented is accompanied by important information for evaluating its scientific usefulness (sample sizes, study designs) but still manages to explain everything without using statistics too tough for the layman to understand. There is a huge body experimental data presented in this book, but in such a way that you never lose sight of the big picture, and what makes each little study interesting and groundbreaking in its own right. The writing is clear, engaging, and even suspenseful. The data presented is mind-boggling and allows you to see just the edges, the hint of a shape that will be the scientific breakthroughs of the next century. Read this now so that you can say ""I told you so"" later."
8,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3904234-clara-raubertas,1,"Deceptive pseudoscience. The author reports ""studies"" purporting to show that ESP and similar phenomena exist -- but she either fails to include statistical information, or includes numbers from the study and then *straight-up lies* about their statistical relevance (hint: guessing the outcome of a coin flip correctly in 52.5% of 100-ish trials is not a statistically significant deviation from chance). Further, there are no negative results included -- she claims that studies show that ESP-like phenomena, like a subject divining another subject's location, exist regardless of the subject's mood, surroundings, being inside a metal box, etc. But if this were true -- why wouldn't everyone constantly be bombarded with psychic information about other people's experiences? There's no model suggested of how psychic phenomena could work to have the suggested effects and yet also remain unnoticed by the majority of the population. If you interpret this book as science, you're doing yourself a great disservice."
9,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4501999-jim-george,4,"Pretty deep stuff, I'm glad that I was preparing my mind back in the 60s and 70s! Our brain is not a storage medium, it is a receiving mechanism, our short and long term knowledge doesn't reside in our brains it is instead stored in the Zero Point Field. The universe is a vast dynamic cobweb of energy exchange from the ZPF and available to us. Consciousness at its most basic is coherent light and the physical world only exists in its concrete state while we are involved in it. If we are going to get energy out of the ZPF for space travel we must decouple from gravity, reduce inertia, or generate enough energy from the vacuum to overcome both. We share the same spirit and brain, there is a power that is unexplainable, an awe we must revere in the cosmos. There truly is a scientific spirituality thing going on out there and in here! I kind of get it - may the Force be with you!"
10,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7420361-alan,5,"This is one of those books that will make you shake your head as you think about the power of prayer. An amazing account of scientifically proven experiences, that are further reinforced by events more recent. The 30 days of prayer in Washington D.C. in support of peace, and the astounding result. Remote prayer for HIV patients, with more amazing results. But the ultimate take away is denomination was not the deciding factor. A must read for those doubtful of the power of your thoughts.The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe"
11,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374605-daniel,4,"I think it's telling that there are no negative reviews of this book here. It's an extremely interesting story about the grid of energy that connects everything on earth to everything else on earth, as well as to everything else in the universe. Sound like a lot to absorb? Well, it is, but it is done tastefully with some very compelling data that does not misrepresent itself. The data does not need to be inflated to be astounding; it is in fact the mere decimal of difference in the data that speaks to the amazing truth about this interconnectivity. Please read this book. I don't know what will change when we all have read this book, but something will, I'm sure of it."
12,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,5,"This is by far one of the most important books I have read, and I think anyone should read.As a yoga practitioner, and one who has gone through reiki training, my rational mind seeks more scientific substantiation of what the yogis, healers and spiritualists have known for thousands of years. The field refers to the zero point field (ZPF), which is made up of the spaces between sub-atomic particles. At absolute zero, this field still emits energy. It is not a vacuum but a field that is constantly exchanging energy and information.The author pulls together research done over the past 40-50 years showing that all discoveries together point towards a common direction:-since an electron can either be a wave or a particle, everything exists in a field of possibility and potential until consciousness changes it either way-that consciousness and intention can impact the physical world, which in turn also support the positive action of prayer and spiritual healing eg healing hands on the health of others-due to the ZPF even ordinary humans can see from a distance, into the past and into the future-the inter-connectedness of all thingsSome of the experiments also show that the most effect influences happen when: -we are in a relaxed state (meditation, biofeedback)-there is reduced sensory input or physical activity-when the right brain in functioning well-if you believe-and if you believe that everything is inter-connectedResearch also shows that all living cells have photon emissions, so in fact we are really beings of light. The ZPF allows instant communication through resonance, not just to other cells in our body but to the rest of the world. In world and the universe, is in fact one big consciousness.All these lend support to yoga, reiki, meditation, the Vedas, Christian prayer and laying of hands as well as the law of attraction. In short, science is beginning to explain miracles. I feel so exonerated about what I have believed to be possible and possibly true. I am so excited to see what will unfold in years to come. "
13,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383016-cheryl,5,"A fascinating read! If you believe that there is an energy field that exists beyond human comprehension and want to see the scientific studies that are searching for and proving it exists, this is your book. There are so many fascinating studies regarding quantum physics here! This is one of the best books I have ever read on the reality of intentional and conscious living."
14,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911971-mark,5,Loved this book. Weaves together the scientific work done over the last 80 years which cumulatively goes a very long way to supporting New Age healings. Very eye opening to get such a clearer understanding of spontaneous recovery or telekinesis. Enjoy.
15,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14417467-booksnwool,3,"This book was an interesting read and a great summary of all the research in these related fields of thought. It is extensively referenced and to label all the contents as pseudoscience is unfair. The main fault is that the author gives equal weight to good sources and dodgy ones (though just because the establishment considers something dodgy, it ain't necessarily so!) Lacking a science background, she also misses the meaning of some of her conclusions. To be fair, it would be very difficult to keep your mind straight while you researched this sort of stuff unless you had a rigorous education with some science or philosophy background. OTOH, her sceptical critics do not do much better on this score, assuming that McTaggart is claiming things that she never actually states. I've only rated 'The Field' as 3 stars because while it starts out well, it drifts into weirdness as it goes on. A lot of pages are devoted to the results of alleged 'remote viewing' experiments, which is all unverifiable given the source (even the lab logs could be faked, the real agenda might be a sociological experiment to test people's gullibility). I would like to see a fresh assessment of the fields of study in this book, a decade on, using a wider range of results and giving due weight to studies with transparent and reprducible results. In this case I suspect that much of the second half of the book would shrink to a few pages. The first half was fascinating, describing how discoveries about the zero point field might explain various natural phenomena ranging from inertia to how memories are retrieved. The stuff about the uses of coherence in cells for communication is revolutionary and explains a great deal that the purely chemical way of looking at cell biology cannot explain. This is where my background is and I can vouch that there is nothing psuedo about the science in this section, although it may be now outdated. I am quite willing to entertain the idea that the zero point field, being timeless, holds an echo of every event and that through some kind of resonance we can access our memories through it. It seems far-fetched but stranger things have turned out to be true, especially in quantum theory. Luca Turin is investigating whether our most basic sense, smell, occurs at the quantum level. I also have no problem with quantum nonlocality affecting the macro world at times. After all, if the energy of the universe is linked, then tugging on one corner of the universe may well simultaneously move anything linked to it, however far away it may be. In my old age I'm even becoming sufficiently open-minded to accept that the observer really might be important as quantum physics indicates.However, if you accept all of the assertions in this book at face value, you quickly find yourself in 'Men Who Stare At Goats' territory. It all sounds nice but the problem is that it doesn't actually work. James Randi's $100k reward still remains unclaimed for a good reason: levitation, psychokinesis etc don't really work, not for most of us anyway. Wishing to win the Lotto doesn't either. Even the study showing the healing effect of prayer has been counterbalanced by many more studies showing it to have no effect at all. And Bernie Siegel, who writes a blurb on the back, has since conceded that his visualisation experiments for cancer patients were unsuccessful. (Although I'm sure his care and dedication relieved a lot of his patients' distress.) To be fair to the author, nowhere does she imply anything like what 'The Secret' claims, that you can have what you want by wishing for it. All the studes she cites only say that events can be skewed by a small amount. If the observer is in tune with the universe and can sway it a little, this doesn't mean it creates the universe exactly how he wishes it. Presumably his wants are counterbalanced by those of all the other observers! And yet... most of us have had had moments of intuition, insight and telepathy with others close to us, whether we like to admit it or not.Positive synergy in the social setting has been proven to be the major contributor to happiness, health and longevity. Tragically we have seen many times that evil and negative groupthink can take hold of a cult or society with frightening ease. Synergy produces magical effects in the biological sphere, perhaps even sparking dead molecules into life. Could synergy, in this case 'coherence', do the same in physics to bring the universe alive? Why not? There is a lot here that bears further examination."
16,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236868-amy,5,"This book is ridiculously fascinating. And wonderfully heady. And very, very difficult to grok. What you may or may not know about me: I am enchanted (albeit still utterly mystified) by quantum mechanics. If Peter Vollhardt, my Organic Chemistry professor at UC Berkeley in 1989, had somehow managed to explain quantum mechanics a little more clearly at the time, the course of my life may very well have been different. I might be working in a weird little lab somewhere, investigating the Zero Point Field, which is what Lynne McTaggart explores in The Field.What is the Zero Point Field? Even after reading this book, I’m not sure I can really explain it. In quantum physics, all microscopic objects vibrate because of quantum fluctuations. The energy created by these constant fluctuations of electromagnetic waves is the Zero Point Field. The ZPF is, in theory, the source of all energy and matter. All beings (consciousness) are connected to and in communication with one another through this field; our intention focuses this energy and creates the world around us. The act of observation is literally a creative act; our intention creates our reality. (Which, honestly, isn’t all that different from how I would define poetry, or any other genre of art.)Call it global consciousness, call it qi, call it parapsychology, call it God…McTaggart’s book ranges widely, covering topics such as Einstein’s “spooky” action-at-a-distance, remote viewing, spiritual healers, ESP, homeopathy, prayer and how all of these apparently supernatural phenomena can be scientifically explained by the ZPF. The western world of science and medicine is finally catching up to where the rest of the world’s populations have been for centuries.Does the consciousness of human beings have incredible powers—-to heal ourselves, to heal the world—-in a sense, to make it as we wish it to be? In the words of a certain poster on FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder’s wall: I want to believe."
17,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26767308-michelle-desgagne,4,"The author goes to great lengths to introduce complex concepts in layman's terms to those of us who are not nor will ever be, Rocket Scientists! That said however several of these concepts are still tricky for most of us to absorb with the same zeal that the author presents them with. I loved the precept; Present the works of cutting edge science & scientists in readable and accessible language so that we can all be as excited about these new ground-breaking realities as the scientists themselves. I was excited & interested but the truth is the never-ending scientific prose just wore me down after about 2/3 the way through. I did finish this book but with significantly less enthusiasm then when I started. Still, it was a beautiful journey through seemingly endless possibilities...worth the effort. I'm just about to begin the sequel-The Intention Experiment. "
18,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49344124-aidan-reid,4,Quite technical at times but a pretty enjoyable read. A good one for lovers of 'The Secret'.
19,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5091561-vince-dacosta,5,"This book has changed our concept of the Universe. Lynne often says she is not a scientist, but she has collaborated with some of the best and effectively put their thoughts and discoveries into the public domain. I'll never forget reading her opening words: ""We are poised on the brink of a revolution - a revolution as daring and profound as Einstein's discovery of relativity."" She then went on to tell us about that revolution."
20,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,3,"I really do want to be convinced that there is a 'secret force in the universe' because it's a really, really interesting concept.Unfortunately, this is not the book that will convince me.There's just too much jumping to conclusions without sufficient explanation. Maybe some of that is my lack of understanding - maybe if I was less tired when I read it I could have given it more attention and taken more in.One thing I wonder though: why has this book not changed the world already? Why are we still operating under a paradigm that says that we are under the thrall of matter and that we can do nothing about it? Why are we still giving our power away to material goods and possessions? Why are we still slaves when we have the power to be masters (the secret force of the universe) at our fingertips?I mean, if this were true - then it would change everything! There are some lovely experiments described here, but there are so many gaps in the logic of it all that I just can't swallow the conclusions.For example: they've got this machine that registers changes in the quantum field and when it is tested, it picks up changes in individuals, and it works for groups, and it works for conferences and TV programmes, and it works locally and from a distance, and it works for the past and for the future, and it works in the here and now. To prove that it is working in all these circumstances, the experimenters are comparing all these multiple changes in the quantum field to a 'baseline where nothing is happening'.My big fat hairy question is: how is it possible, with all these quantum effects happening in every single direction and circumstance, for there to be any sort of baseline. There is no possible occasion during which there is nothing happening!And that's where all this falls down. The experiments are cool, but they are not rigorous enough to prove anything to me. There are just too many variables to control and they are all confounding. At least, that it, they confound my poor little head completely and utterly."
21,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368274-rachel,5,"This has to be the most fascinating book I've read in years. Really.I saw the author give a blurb on a documentary a couple of months ago and what she said really caught my attention. I went looking for her online and ran into this book.What it is: Descriptions (in story form; it isn't dry) of the historical and recent scientific studies/research of Quantum Physics and the Zero Point Field. Okay... I'd *heard* of Quantum Theory and that it worked 'underneath' Newtonian physics, but that was about it it. The studies/research (all hard science, all with strict protocols, all began by atheist/non-spiritual scientists) finds the science behind some really fascinating things: A collective conscious, the power of prayer/meditation/healings, ESP, eastern medicine, time/space relationships, etc. (I could go on and on). The back blurb says ""... McTaggart reveals a radical new paradigm - that the human mind and body are not separate from their environment... that consciousness may be central in shaping our world."" (I just can't say it better myself.)The funny things is that as I read along, I found the way I observed the world / people around me started to shift dramatically. The idea of all of humanity (and really it's greater than just us people) being intimately connected to each other and to something greater than us is so hugely powerful to me. That is the opposite of the individualistic, competitive world we live in. (science meeting up with spirituality?)"

Psychic activity, remote viewing, the power of prayer and homoeopathy are all discussed. The energy found in the vacuum - or the zero point field - seems to be the key to all sorts of unexplained phenomena: ESP or remote viewing, homeopathy, energy medicine, spiritual healing, and even the homing instincts of animals. Lynne McTaggart follows the life and work of disparate physicists, pioneers in the area where the paranormal meets quantum physics. From the PublisherA book which, like Capra’s Tao of Physics, explores the latest offerings from the scientific community who have found an explanation for the supernatural. It promises to be one of the most successful popular science books of the year. Will appeal to readers of Frijof Capra, Arthur C. Clarke, Graham Hancock and those interested in the paranormal, energy medicine, and popular scienceIt's a rare occurrence where I cannot abide a book in any way at all and this is an embodiment of all that is distasteful. The audio is so fuzzy when turned up that I could not work with it... so I sat listening... and didn't like what I was hearing. I like my science to be proveable or it's just hocus pocus."
23,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4157851-dhitri,3,"Lynne McTaggart is a journalist who has bravely embarked on a quest to scientifically explain ""the life force"" that governs the universe. I have neither the necessary background nor am I well-read enough in this subject to scrutinize her findings, but her research seems to be solid and her arguments as well as critical analysis compelling. As someone who didn't start out as an expert on science, quantum physics to be precise, she has managed to extricate complex scientific findings and hypotheses and put them into a book for the ordinary reader. Using analogies and anecdotes, she made it easy for readers to follow her train of thought and made her conclusions seem plausible, if not, groundbreaking. Again, it is open to dispute whether her understanding of the subject is a scientifically acceptable one. The audio book is narrated by the author herself. McTaggart is a fantastic reader who is very good at applying personal touches and paces her reading just right, so that listeners have an easy time following her train of thought and are given the space to digest her findings and conclusions. I am a terrible listener and audio books were never my thing yet this one is of the rare type that managed to capture my focus long enough for me to make sense of the arguments without having to replay them. Recommended."
24,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,4,"I was expecting something completely fluffy, but I was impressed early on by some of the research that was described. The book ranges from work in quantum physics (specifically, idea of the Zero Point Field) to biology to (inadvertent) homeopathy to the holographic model of the mind to psychic phenomena in gathering evidence to support its argument that this Zero Point Field is nothing less than the substrate of the ""external"" world and ""internal"" experience. Here's how McTaggart summarizes the consequences of this research and its implications:The communication of the world did not occur in the visible realm of Newton, but in the subatomic world of Werner Heisenberg.Cells and DNA communicated through frequencies.The brain perceived and made its own record of the world in pulsating waves.A substructure underpins the universe that is essentially a recording medium of everything, providing a means for everything to communicate with everything else.People are indivisible from their environment. Living consciousness is not an isolated entity. It increases order in the rest of the world. The consciousness of human beings has incredible powers, to heal ourselves, to heal the world -- in a sense, to make it as we wish it to be. (p.225)  "
25,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4893739-jose,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book: on one hand I found it really interesting; it tells about Quantum Mechanics, and the frontier of physics and the unlimited possibilities lying beneath the Zero Point Field (which gives the book its title).On the other hand, the book uses the (still unknown and rather hypothetical) Zero Point Field to explain almost any ""paranormal"" or ""alternative"" phenomena, some of them already explained by our current and well established scientific paradigm.Despite that I found the book entertaining and easy to read, and with some interesting ideas from the philosophical point of view."

It proclaimsthat our consciousness may be central in shaping our world.We are always hearing “If you believe it, you can achieve it” or“with positive thought you can change your world.” The Fieldgives you proof! It is an easy read that covers the mostamazing scientific studies of the last forty years. If you arelooking to be inspired, give this awesome book a try!"
27,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3284400-charlotte-wrenn,4,"This is a bit difficult to read because of its scientific details but very worth it. It confirmed my own spiritual beliefs and gave me much more peace about death and that our energy simply changes when we die. That our loved ones will always be connected to us no matter what happens in the here and now. That time is a circle, and it confirmed that prayer really works which was cool. A substantial read."

It's based on this research (or the research that this book draws upon at any rate) that the ideas in ""The Secret"" and other self-help books work from: the idea that you can influence outcomes by thought.

35,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51557816-don-sevcik,5,"I had to pick my jaw up off the floor after reading this...twice.No other book in the last 100 years brings together God, science (quantum physics), and metaphysics better than this book.This book is the answer to ""Where is the scientific proof for Think and Grow Rich?""This book is the answer to ""How are thoughts things?""This book is the proof for guys like Bob Proctor who say, ""Your brain is an electrical switching station.""And after reading this book, it ties popular movie references together as well. And it gets you wondering...Let's take Star Wars...The Force represents the God Force/Holy Spirit/Universe Vibration. For science, it is the sub-atomic fieldThe midicholorians represent the amount of connection one person has to the God Force. Meditation builds this. So does your outlook on life.And when you sit down and pick your jaw up off the floor, you start to ask yourself....Were the Bible, the Torah, The Quran, Think and Grow Rich, The Force, all of it, referring to the same thing?Neville Goddard once said that the Bible should be read as a metaphor, where you the reader are the star character, and every reference should use the Hebrew translation. When you do these 3 things, you start to tie together everything that The Field talks about.No matter if you're religious, science driven, or metaphysical, it all ties down to the sub-atomic field. This field constantly vibrates, and guess what, our thoughts, our mood, our outlook shape reality.And finally, we have a book that ties it all together.I can't think of another book that would get religious people, scientists, and metaphysics lovers in the same room to open up a conversation.I've got 500+ books in my library. And only a few have knocked me on my butt and made me stop and think. This is one of them."
36,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81985252-lenka-kopecka,5,"An amazing comprehensive research starting with Rob Mitchell's (6th man on the moon) outlook on ""expanded consciousness"" while in the space. The book takes us through various angles of looking at the field, its existence, influence and a potential use. Explaining first realisations of subatomic world of energy and its materialisation. As Einstein ""kicked the ball off"" following the first thinker Aristotle that the universe is information plenum, then many influential names and their research and studies like Hal Puthoff, Niels Bohr and Max Planck on "" dynamic patterns of the universal energy"". The journey of discovering connection between bio photons and DNA (radiology)by Fritz Albert Popp. Fascinating research by Bienveniste and the memory of water (homeopatics) how a tv magician messed up the protocol to prove him wrong, Pribram and location of cognitive processes in the brain, Braud and biofeedback of relaxation. Then research on ESP as we would know it today, conducted mainly at Princeston named as PEAR project with quantifiable data collected over decades. Lastly Russel Targ's input and his daughter's Elisabeth research on healing energy in targeted Aids patients. Robert Nelson's studies on collective consciousness and how electogaiagram picks on coherence reffered to as ""quantum superradiance"" within Global Consiousness Project. Lastly the Maharishi effect (transcendetal meditation) and how collective superradiance influence events around us. Which displays us with opportunities and explanations. I loved the read and made a lot of notes as not a physicist. Lynne McTaggart's writting is beautiful and puts a little artful spin on scientific research explaining to masses. I am very impressed by this lady taking 8 years to research on this matter and putting it together in the most amazing way."
37,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21514723-p,4,"Wow! It took me forever to complete this! Then again I feel like I just started this yesterday. Some of the truths presented in this book were so eye opening and mind blowing forcing me to take days away from it to process what I read. This book is not what I expected. And to realize all these researches were happening even before I was born, it's just feels right.Since childhood I had a fascination for quantum physics and strongly believed in the energy and life force of everything even in the seemingly inanimate objects, especially crystals and beings not visible to the naked eye. I was sure I'm just crazy but i had this undeniable feeling of being watched, not in a paranoid way but felt like in a protective way, there was some collective source and we were all connected.Psychkinesis, remote viewing, precognition and telepathy might sound like concepts out of a sci-fi but I knew they were no more fictitious than i was. But it feels reassuring to be presented with studies that validate their existence. Even though i had devoured books on metaphysics and QP before, there were times I felt this book being a little too technical and sometimes bordering to boring even though Quantum Physics can never be boring! That's the only reason I'm settling for 4 stars even though this book is nothing short of amazing."
38,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587082-kathryn,4,"The author says that this book is a layperson's summary of quantum physics research. This was not an easy read. Though the author seemed to do a really good job of condensing really difficult concepts of quantum physics, down into laypeson's language and understanding (How would I really know? I'm not a quantum physicist.) , it still was over my head sometimes, and I had to just keep going, on faith. A couple times the author made ""statements of fact"" that really aren't fact (for example, that all the sounds in the world are within the range of human perception), which made me wonder if that faith was justified. But this book adds a dimension to my world view, and, so, will be on my list of the ten most influential books of my life. I've read in many other books, ideas about how we create our own world, using our thoughts and beliefs. This book explains how we do that, as well as tying together many explanations for varied ""miracles"" and ""unexplainables"" -(like, how do jellyfish coordinate their communication so that they instantaneously all start to sting me at the same time? or how do birds murmurate? how do psychics see things many miles away from them? and many other such wonders). Pretty impressive."
39,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,3,"Funny thing before i read this book, i thought it could be like new-age kind of book, but then, the more i read, it actually has some solid current science basis such as quantum physics. The author mentioned about zero point field all the time in this book to bring out the quantum mechanism react on the idea she wanted to prove. She actually gave us many ""evidences"" from the experiments on Homeopathy, down to the molecule level, we are able to correct the cells that went wrong. She showed the results she collected from remote visions, other kind of telepathy when the 2 individuals reach the same frequency. She also gave us the example that someone was able to predict there is ring on Jupiter (not Saturn, because we knew there are rings on Saturn) with remote vision, then it proved to be true.The purpose to try to make sense of our human consciousness into quantum level or chemistry has been brought up by numerous writers, i am open to this possibility but so far we can not jump to this conclusion yet.I certainly wish to see one day we are able to know how it works inside of our brain and how it switch on and off the consciousness, even beyond the death."

It is a book that bridges the gap between science and religion and gives real answers. It is science proving the existence of 'God', a collective consciousness. We are more powerful than we realise, we have the collective capacity to make the world a better place.Everything in the universe is in constant communication. We as people are indivisible from our environment and from everything around us. Our thoughts truly do have incredible powers. Explanations and evidence for healing ourselves or others by prayer or intention. The truth about atoms, waves, time and space, telepathic communication, clairvoyance and poltergeists. Proof for the presence of a universal intelligence, validation for prayer, meditation and alternative medicine. Even ancient folkore and traditions held by other cultures come to make sense, even to the non-scientifically minded.This book brings everything together. Food for thought. A vision for the future."

Being an engineer there is part of me that screams when reading some unscientific statements and conclusion, but... if there is one thing we as humans should learn from our past is that fundamental understanding about our existence changes from time to time and one should keep an open mind.Basically the book tries to summarize a huge assortment of scientific research and their findings and how it could progress into our society at large. I don’t agree on all the trajectories being deducted and the conclusion they would mean, but a huge portion are truly mind boggling. We live in an exciting time, when the conscious part of our existence is slowly and carefully being approached from from the scientific community as it seems to drive the core fundamentals of our physics and the spiritual and religious side of our society is slowly warming up for a big hug as we maybe might be looking at the same thing.

42,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13177682-sky-feather,5,"That was such a magnificent read! It went deeper into the mistakes that a remote viewer might do, and that is to try and interpret their results. It reminded me myself, some years ago, isolated, meditating for prolonged periods of time, reaching non-ordinary states of consciousness, ""moving"" with energy non-locally.There are many detailed cases of nonlocal healing mentioned in the specified chapter, using many different ways of healing. Something that I have also experienced myself with the healing of my severely ill father. Even though it is working, yet, there's often a price to pay for the healer, as disease is accumulation of sins/karma, and that has to be transferred somewhere, it cannot be that easily eliminated.Then there are the lingering energies of sacred places, they all leave their footprint non-locally, each day, in the present moment, nonstop."
43,0060931175,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431264-sandra,4,"Was definitely one of the best sciencey books I've read. Everything really is connected. I remember as a child my mother saying God is everywhere. The zero point field connects everything from the cells in your body to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. God knows every hair on your head, just as he knows every planet, star, galaxy etc. This is more science based with hints at Faith and God. But for me it is more proof of his existence and our creation. God truly is Great. Now if we could only harness the power of the zero point field then we could truly have free and unlimited power here on earth and to travel the cosmos. "
