It was just that we, with our obsessive propensity to classify and divide had made the artificial boundaries.The only complaint about the book is the fact that it goes into needless depth about the fundamentals of classical physics and then skims over the ""new physics"" to an extent. Also, Zukav seems to feel that repeating an idea or concept three times is the best way to convey it to the lay person.Except for these peeves, it was magnificent to look at Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg etc not as scientists discussing theories and experiments but as philosophers arguing over the nature of reality and mysticism. The reader has to keep in mind that this is by no means a very up to date book and Einstein and his contemporaries star in the narrative more than CERN or Hadrons or Higgs. But this does not take away the fact that the new theories, though radically departed from what was ""new physics"" at the time of publishing of this book, still corroborates his base arguments. That too in even more weirder and psychedelic ways.The more I read in the realm of new physics, the more I am convinced that all truly fundamental scientific theories tend to follow a life cycle - rejection, ridicule, incredulity, acceptance, dogmatism, degeneration, overthrowal, and finally resurrection. This is the case with all true ideas - so it might be with our vedic and oriental philosophies too. The physics classes and laboratories of this century might have meditation lessons and yogic experiments... Science might finally grow up enough to explain to lay people what only mystics and yogis could experience - we might finally evolve the language and the concepts to explain and understand the structure of the universe without experiencing it - we might know nirvana without feeling it. Is that an uplifting or depressing thought, I am not sure."
1,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,2,"Yesterday, I read some scathing comments about this book, and the closely related The Tao of Physics, in Woit's Not Even Wrong. Apparently, there used to a be an approach to quantum mechanics called S-matrix theory, which was popular among left-leaning physicists in the early 70s. Woit refers to ""The People's Republic of Berkeley"". It was something to do with ""abolition of the aristocracy of particles"", which I must say I didn't completely get, but you can see how this might appeal. As I understand it, the basic idea was not to talk about possibly intangible interactions between particles like quarks, whose existence is hard to demonstrate directly, but only about the objectively measurable scattering matrix.Anyway, according to Woit, S-matrix theory never quite worked, and when quantum chromodynamics and the Standard Model came in, around 1974, it pretty much disappeared. But Capra, in The Tao of Physics, still clung to the S-matrix ideas, and every time the book was reprinted he would add forewords and afterwords that were more and more out of touch with reality, claiming that history had shown that the S-matrix approach was the one true way, when in fact QCD had knocked it out of the park. Then Zukav followed Capra, and wrote this book.Woit, evidently tearing his hair out, says that both books are still selling well, and that, although S-matrix theory is now completely discredited, it embarrassingly lives on as ""nutty New Age philosophy"".I read Zukav's book in the early 80s, and I wasn't that impressed, though I had no idea that it was this much at odds with mainstream physics. I thought he was just presenting mainstream ideas in a poetic way. A frightening story about how careful you need to be with popular science texts."

In layman's terms, the author compares Eastern beliefs, psychology, and quantums physics. Interesting book, but I wasn't as 'wowed' by it as some were.""If this is so, then the distinction between scientists, poets, painters, and writers is not clear. In fact, it is possible that scientists, poets, painters, and writers are all members of the same family of people whose gift it is by nature to take those things which we call commonplace and to re-present them to us in such ways that our self-imposed limitations are expanded. Those people in whom this gift is especially pronounced, we call geniuses.""3 Stars = I'm glad I read it."
3,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/366448-lane-wilkinson,1,"I can't even dignify this book with an inclusion on my 'science' bookshelf. Surely, the most dangerous rhetoric is that which sounds plausible. 'Dancing Wu Li Masters' does the whole ""Ancient Chinese Secret"" treatment of particle physics that was so popular during the 1970s. Unfortunately, I worry that too many who read this bestseller were irrevocably taken with an esoteric, transcendental, and ultimately fallacious interpretation of contemporary science."
4,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,3,"This is a book that lightly, and perhaps appropriately, suggests a connection between eastern religions and the developments in 20th century physics, notably Einstein's theories of relativity, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and the collective effort, from Max Planck through Einstein to Nils Bohr and many others, to develop quantum theory, quantum mechanics and other dimensions of ""quantum"" reality.The fundamental issue is that logic breaks down in the quantum world. This is explained well. Quantum reality deals in probabilities, not certainties, and phenomena that could be waves or could be quanta or particles, depending on when they are measured.There is a huge quotient of the subjective in quantum thinking, which is to say that the observer alters that which is observed, and that which is observed has a somewhat uncanny similarity to the lightning fast disjunctures that characterize the human mind. We think about one thing, then another. We flash from mood to mood. We imagine impossible things. We dream in gravity-defying dimensions that also take us back in time.The eastern religions enter the picture describing everything that we take note of as illusion...or a veil...or the Tao...the path...all in motion...all self-transforming...all becoming as opposed to all permanent and present.Sometimes books like this one capture us because we think they will be fairly easy primers, sexed up with lots of provocative speculation. This isn't that kind of book. Its dry and demanding in places, necessarily so.When it was written, string theory wasn't around. A lot of other things weren't around either. But it's still a good book if approached with a certain diligence. There's little doubt that we do live in a quantum world, but we are insufficiently educated to understand that. Breaking the news to the great uneducated public is something Zukav does well."
5,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35171790-p,4,"Made an otherwise complicated subject readily readable for me, even eager for more. The simple analogies and examples created that feeling of an epiphany, as in: ""OK, I get it now!"" Beautiful.Since it's been over 30 years since I read this, it's time to re-new. Can never know too much about quantum physics. Or its relationship to philosophy."
6,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719576-donald,5,"Well, I read this book at the advice of Jeff Sneider who recommended it highly. I agree. This book, while difficult in places, does lead me to question my view of reality, which has been purely Newtonian (read the book to understand). I'd rate this book right up with Godel, Escher, and Bach. I will think often about it. It may be very well be true, that everyone lives in Aristotle's metaphorical cave, seeing shadows of the essence of reality. Actually, quantum mechanics pretty much says it IS true. Zukav argues that experiencing reality through, perhaps, meditation and eastern religious metaphors, may lead to a greater degree of ""knowing"" or enlightenment, as the case may be. He argues that contradictions are inherent in intellect. I can be a scientist using Newtonian physics to make a career, judge student performance and the like, and also believe in God, angels, fairies and so on. Basically, quantum mechanics argues we know really nothing about the essence of reality, so anything could be and maybe anything in actually is real. There's a quote in the book that I will post in my office and spread around my scientific camp, and it's worth thinking and mulling over.""Reality"" is what we take to be true. What we take to be true is what we believe. What we believe is based upon our perceptions. What we perceive depends upon what we look for. What we look for depends upon what we think. What we think depends upon what we perceive. What we perceive determines what we take to be true. What we take to be true is our reality."
7,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185993-jen,1,"This is the worst book ever written. From his completely nonsensical leaps from point to point, to his annoying tendency to follow each mention of ""matter"" with ""(pun?)"" to his pseudo-knowledge of quantum mechanics and belief that randomness = free will to his decision not to explain the uncertainty principle in any way that might make sense and make it seem less mystical to his just plain terrible writing and awful, irrelevant quotations I can safely say that this is the worst piece of snake oil I've ever read (granted, I didn't finish it so maybe the last 100 pages were all about how the first half was a complex joke). It also brought back horrific, repressed memories of reading The Holographic Universe (a book in which the author had absolutely no knowledge of how either holographs or the universe might possibly work).If you want quantum mechanics, read QED by Feynman. If you want to believe that electrons are spiritual entities, just go ahead and believe it. But don't rewrite the history of physics to back up your case, it doesn't work. You silly, silly, New Age people, just stop. It's embarrassing.[...although Ben and I did have fun reading parts of it out loud to each other and laughing hysterically:][ALSO WHY IS EVERY CHAPTER LABELED CHAPTER ONE?!?!:]"
8,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1994-keith-mukai,4,"This is probably as good as a physics-for-the-layman book can get. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. Far from it, in fact.The strength of the book is Zukav's review of the history of physics. He does a good job setting up and explaining the major breakthroughs so that you, the reader, can appreciate their significance in pretty substantial ways. That's quite a feat. His clarity gets weaker as he starts to go into the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics though. At times he's so eager to jump to the scientific and philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics that he sprints past the reader's understanding. I re-read and re-read and re-read passages until I finally saw that he had left out certain points that would have made things much more comprehensible, had he been more careful.The biggest flaw in the book is his hippie obsession with his Wu-Li metaphor. At times it's elegant and beautiful, but more often than not it's annoying and overblown. He's too eager to yammer on about particles acting as if they were conscious, ties between quantum mechanics and telepathy, and on and on. He's not a scientist so he's free to make these leaps of imaginative fancy, but I was constantly rolling my eyes whenever he started to wax philosophic about some new wrinkle in quantum mechanics.The other thing that grates is that he thinks the book is very funny. He even writes in the introduction that he's amazed and so pleased with how funny the book is, that it is, in fact, funnier than he is in real life. Mr. Zukav? It's not funny. His humor is cloying and totally unnecessary.Still, if you're interested in the history of physics--from Newton to Einstein to the birth of quantum mechanics--this is the book to read. But oddly enough, I'd recommend that you read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as a primer to this book. Zen covers a lot of the difficult philosophical underpinnings that Zukav has integrated into his book. And Zen is a better introduction to those ideas.This summer, apparently, will be the summer of physics. I've figured out a logical progression:0. (Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance)1. The Dancing Wu Li Masters (history of physics + good discussion of Einstein + good intro to quantum mechanics)2. A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking (deeper discussion of Einstein's space-time + intro to quantum gravitation)3. The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene (superstring theory of quantum gravity)To some degree each of the three physics books cover the same ground, but Zukav excels at surveying the history of physics and at describing Einstein's three important contributions. His intro to quantum mechanics is good enough, but that will be covered in more detail later.Hawking rushes through the history of physics so you really need Zukav as a primer. But Hawking then goes much deeper into the implications of general relativity's space-time. I'm halfway through it now and it's pointing towards a unification of general relativity with quantum mechanics (aka quantum gravitation).I began reading Brian Greene's book but realized that Zukav and Hawking really must come first. Greene also surveys the history of physics but does so briefly. His discussions of general relativity also aren't as robust as Zukav or Hawking's. And since string theory is the ""final"" theory, it really should come last anyway."
9,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1195169-eric-witchey,5,"When a writer can make something I believed inaccessible to me seem like dinner conversation in which I can participate, I'm thrilled to the core. Thanks to Gary Zukav. Without him, many other books I've read would never have made sense at all. How could I have approached The Elegant Universe without having read this first? How could I sit down at Thanksgiving with my high-energy physicist brother without having read this book? "
10,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6564745-james-swenson,2,"According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it is impossible to know both the exact position and momentum of a particle: in fact, perfect knowledge of one makes it impossible to know anything about the other. The Dancing Wu Li Masters is a book about quantum physics and metaphysics, in which, as far as I can tell, all of the physics is correct, and, ironically, everything else is uniformly wrong. Gary Zukav, if he had written the previous sentence, would have replaced the word ""ironically"" with ""therefore."" His characteristic error is to invent an analogy to describe a quantum concept, then claim that the analogy is literally true. Thus, for example, photons ""act as if they know"" how an experiment is designed, so photons are conscious.Image: http://xkcd.com/1240/My remark that all the physics in The Dancing Wu Li Masters is correct should be taken with a grain of salt, because I quit reading on page 117. At this point, Zukav wrote a sentence that should cause any author to question the value of his occupation: ""Nonsense is nonsense only when we have not yet found that point of view from which it makes sense."" Allow me to retort: A token of gratitude would kindly inquire something about you."
11,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,4,"As an engaging introduction to an enthralling science, for people who've never studied physics, this book is fantastic. I appreciated the historical approach to the topic, learning one piece of the puzzle at a time in the order of those who made the discoveries; I feel like this really helped my understanding. I'm someone who has held a fear of math and physics for years, but Zukav writes in a clear and thorough fashion, stopping himself every once a while to ensure that the reader is with him. The average layperson could learn the basics of complicated physics from this book, easily.Only when Zukav makes large leaps into philosophy, full of holes and assumptions and ""logical"" ruling-out of other possible explanations (despite a whole chapter praising Einstein for approaching physics with a beginner's mind not bothered with traditional conclusions of what is and is not possible), does he stumble. I knew going into it that he wrote this book with a particular readership in mind but to my surprise, I felt like I actually could have used MORE math, MORE in-depth explanation, and less sweeping extrapolation; this is no fault of the author's though, and I will have to credit him with encouraging me to study physics in greater depth.In summary: a superb, well-written introduction to new physics, whose only flaw (to my tastes at least) is a penchant for applying the knowledge to big-picture philosophical levels-- which isn't really something that anyone as clearly fascinated by the discovery of these new physics as Zukav is can be faulted for :)"
12,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/151055-max-ostrovsky,2,"It was tough reading a book concerning ""new"" physics written over 30 years ago. I couldn't stop thinking about updates and what recent theories have added to the discussion. That said, the book wasn't what I was expecting. Sure, I was expecting a discussion of physics and its tie into the everything-ness philosophies of the world. The explanations were thorough and clear. But I wanted some sort of connection. What was the point of the book? And maybe this is just too much of me getting in the way - after all, part of the title does say it's just an overview. But still, I wanted to know the why? What was the unifying theory behind the whole book? And that very well may be the exact point of the book, I'm aware. After all, it did flat out equal aspects to Zen koans. Maybe I'm supposed to put the book down and meditate on it. I'm not a math person, well, at least I haven't been in almost two decades. I understood the concepts and the theories explained. But I just wasn't interested. I did, however, love the different explanation/definitions for Wu Li. That was perfect and I wanted the entire book to reflect that - and I believe that there was an attempt made to do that, but it fell flat for me. I also loved the fact that every chapter was Chapter One. But the book is definitely dated. It's late 70's LSD references were more of a distraction than helpful, relevant, or even funny. "
13,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353587-ethan,3,"The annoying this about this book is that mostly it's wonderful. Gary Z has a clear, lucid prose style, and his explanation of wave-particle duality etc is as good as any I've come across. So when he says that subatomic particles are ""conscious"" or that he believes in telepathy, it's that much more frustrating. I have a number of very bright friends who get taken in by New Age snake oil because of careless use of language in a book like this."
14,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,5,"Physics used to be my favourite subject in my pre-engineering career ( sadly, Engineering did kill that part in me which thought academic study can be someone's career). Not the whole of it ( Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism never interested me), but especially loved Mechanics. Never knew then what I was reading were completely outdated, if not wrong. The part with Modern Physics were just cursorily touched and most part were encouraged to mug without questioning much. Well, probably saved for later, which never came in my life. And I had never imagined that I will get back to it again.Now, in the quest to find the answer to the ultimate question, ""Is there God?"" I needed to get a perspective of the creation of the universe and purpose of life. Shuttling from religion and philosophy I arrived at the door steps of Physics. First there was Big Bang, (by Simon Singh) which told me if I comprehend one small part of physics called 'Relativity' by some guy called 'Einstein' it would come in handy understanding the creation of our world. I struggled through a brief history of time to understand the theory of everything. But I was more confused than before till I realized that there is a way around to understand God through New Physics. So I pulled from the bottom of my rack a book that I had bought almost 8 years ago, but never dared to read. The Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav. ( How I wish I had done that 8 years before!)In one sentence, this book had similar effect on me as far science is concerned, as Sophie's World had on me for Philosophy.Gary Zukav not only introduces the difficult concepts of Quantum Mechanics and the theory of Relativity in a simplistic layman-language, but also presents the new concepts of modern physics with lucid and vivid illustrations that Physics becomes a pleasant reading. As some reviewer rightly said, 'Stripped of Mathematics, Physics becomes pure enchantment.' Its a must must must read for anyone who wants to understand how science explains why the universe is how it is (even if it is little outdated and I'm sure many mind boggling theories would have been discovered thereafter).Now coming to the very essence of both the theories - Quantum and Relativity, and their proponents, and their agreements ant their discords - everything is more fantastic than fiction. These theories takes you to the limits of human intellect - be it warping space-time or now-here-now-there electrons or mattet that is wave or wave that is matter - and gives you an intellectual gratification when you even grasp of iota of it.The thin line between Science and Philosophy blurs when science talks in the terms of consciousness and philosophy discusses paradox and evidences. And the beauty of these theories that most of the stuff can be cultivated in your mind indulging in thought experiments, not in a laboratory (if you do not intend to be an experimenting physicist)."
15,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/982736-mike,4,"Mind-blowing. In the interest of the required hyperbole book review demands: frustratingly fascinating. Frustrating because the mind grasps quicker what can be conveyed through language. Frustrating because, when read, you can't help but get the endorphine, intellectual rush that demands you share the knowledge with all. Frustrating because, something clicks, your mind abstractly grasps the idea, but when trying to convey these exciting new concepts to friends and loved ones, you feel grossly inadequate. All the while, you understand it. Why can't you teach it? Redemptive, in the end, because after explaining it a few times to different people, you end up solidifying the concepts even more. Seriously mind-blowing, in our scientific quest to find out the fundamental building block of all matter we reach the startling conclusion (though not so startling if familiar with the Upanishads): spirit--non physical realm of pure-potentiality--wave lengths stretching through different dimensions. Written for those unaccustomed to physics and mathematical language, the book stays in the realm of science while inferring possibilities that are nothing less than life-transformative."
16,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452841-sharayu-gangurde,4,"This is an amazing book and amazing so, because it revitalized the science training within me! As a teenager, I was so absorbed and completely fascinated by Neils Bohr's postulates, Max Planck's Theory that Physics was the air i breathed! And, after that phase I realized I was so out of touch of this very nature- atoms/protons/ quasi-protons/ quarks! Wow! This book truly is meant for the ordinary layman who is or was never a science student! I can even think of a few friends I can gift this book to! What science really means in the life of a student and a researcher versus in the ordinary life of a layman, this book completely closes gaps on it! What a wonderful lucid style of explaining modern physics! I kept reading hungrily, savouring every single word, if there were equations, my joy would have have known no bounds! Clearly, one of the best resource books for everyone! The Wu Li masters philosophy is interesting too! This book is highly recommended and if i were on the education board, this would just be THE book to study!"
17,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,4,"Zukav did a surprisingly competent job describing physics in laymen terms that it is hard to believe he is not in the STEM field at all. Even though the book is published almost 40 years ago, some of the discussions have not changed much. For example, the first major-loophole-free experiment about non-locality was performed in 2016. A recent poll of physicists on the interpretation of quantum mechanics still checks all the boxes on page 335 — the possible implications of Bell’s Theorem. That said, the book has many things to nitpick. The distorted notion of many interpretations of the word “Wu Li” (Chinese for physics) is utterly wrong, annoying, and frankly stupid. Calling every part “Part I” and every chapter inside the parts “Chapter 1” is another one of those unnecessarily weird attempts to be cute."

If you want clear explanations of quantum mechanics, relativity, and particle physics and Feynman diagrams (with a dose of Eastern philosophy and some Buddhism) look no further than this excellent book. A lot of the foot-notes were contributed by big physicist names and I really enjoyed them, having a physics background.

I should have read this 30 years ago!""Prove that a uniform body with three mutually perpendicular axes of symmetry cannot rotate stably about the axis of intermediate length""I remember it like it was yesterday. This was a question I faced on a second year classical mechanics exam. I got the question right, by the way. As a matter of fact, I scored a perfect 100% on the entire exam but it bothered me immensely that I should be able to prove something mathematically without having the foggiest inkling as to ""why"" it should be so at a much more fundamental level.In fact, it troubled me so deeply that after I received my undergraduate degree in Physics, I declined to pursue any further education in the field and went on to a career in business and finance.In The Dancing Wu Li Masters, Gary Zukav has written a superb explanation as to why my lack of understanding was so normal and why I should have embraced that lack of understanding as opposed to running away from it. In very clear prose, completely devoid of the baffling language of mathematical equations, he has written a story for those of us interested in exploring the mind-expanding (nay, mind-blowing) discoveries of modern advanced physics and cosmology -quantum mechanics; black holes; time travel; entanglement; action at a distance; special and general relativity; the nuclear particle zoo; and much, much more.I reveled in the discovery that even Einstein struggled with the notion that he would never be able to compare his mathematical models with the ""real"" mechanism. Indeed, he couldn't even imagine the meaning of such a comparison.A magnificent blend of philosophy, eastern mysticism and modern physics, Zukav's The Dancing Wu Li Masters is perhaps best summarized by a single sentence from a New York Times Book Review:""Stripped of mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment ... ""While this isn't a book that would likely be accessible to someone without a foot already inside physics' door, it is a breathtaking, joyous revelation to people like myself who have that basic grounding and are looking to increase their knowledge.What the heck, if I had read this in the 1970s instead of waiting until now ... who knows, my entire life and career path might have been changed.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

Re-reading, I would not say the science it re-reveals to the ""ordinary reader"" is obsolete, rather, needs updates, but of course that is not the author's fault. Gary Zukav in several places reiterates that mathematics is not needed to read (and understand) his book, however, it is not for the ordinary non-mathematics reader either. Those, I would suggest would be equally happy if they read the first two and the last chapters only.On the other hand, I was quite happy to be introduced to quantum mechanics through a way that (almost) omitted math formulae. Nevertheless, this is not easy reading at all. But, it is not a new age book either, which relinquishes science into the hands of eastern beliefs or religion. Claiming new physics and eastern beliefs perhaps ""touch"" each other is not a crime for either.As to its language, as much as it claims to simplify itself and repeats expressions to makes the reader comprehend, it does sometimes get on one's nerves.

How does an overview take that much ink?And, if you know some math and some physics terminology like I do, and, you are willing to work through the discussions he presents, you will be rewarded.

90,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25352440-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,3,"This is a book written by a non-physicist that argues how the cutting edge quantum mechanics connect back to buddhist and other wisdom. I do not buy the argument at all, but I think the author tried quite a bit to understand and to convey his understanding about the particle physics. Some of his explanations should be useful as a connecting thread for a more detailed treatment.I started reading it in the middle of july it is middle of october now and I could not finish reading the last 10 or so pages, the connection he was trying to establish between physics and the old wisdom became too suffocating -- to which he might have said, ""Nonsense is that which does not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have superimposed on reality."" Anyways, I think there are still interesting parts here and there, some are as follows:1.""Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however they may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way to open the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all of the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. [Einstein]""2. ""Then physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of atomic phenomena, thereby 'proving' that atoms exist. Of course, what they really proved was that the theoretical existence of atoms was the best explanation of the experimental data that anyone could invent at that time.""3. ""The idea that we do not understand something until we have a picture of it in our heads is a by-product of the Newtonian way of looking at the world. If we want to get past Newton, we have to get past that.""4. ""Quantum theory can predict the probability of a microscopic event with the same precision that Newtonian physics can predict the actual occurrence of a macroscopic event.""5. ""The point of view that we can be without a point of view is a point of view.""6. ""Subatomic particles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere.""7. ""A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a thing which is confined to a region in space. ... It is either here or it is there, but it cannot be both here and there at the same time. ... If it is both places at once, then it is not a particle.""8. ""A proof only proves that we are playing by the rules. (We make the rules, anyway.)""9. ""Access to physical world is through experience. The common denominator of all experiences is the 'I' that does the experiencing. In short, what we experience is not external reality, but our interaction with it.""10. ""What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning. [Heisenberg]""11. ""The first man to see an illusion by which men have flourished for centuries surely stands in a lonely place. [about Einstein.]""12. ""Before Einstein, the totalitarian grasp of 'common sense' held the constancy of the speed of light to the status of a paradox. (Whenever we bump into the limits of out self-imposed cognitive reality, the result is always a paradox.)""13. ""According to the special theory of relativity, a moving object appears to contract in the direction of motion as its velocity increases. James Terrell, a physicist, has demonstrated mathematically that this phenomenon is something like a visual illusion, and, in fact, is analogous to a projection of the real world onto the wall of Plato's cave.""14. ""A rational mind, based on the impressions that it receives from its limited perspective, forms structures which thereafter determine what it further will and will not accept freely. From that point on, regardless of how the real world actually operates, this rational mind, following its self-imposed rules, tries to superimpose on the real world its own version of what must be."""
91,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/680845-meghan,4,"For such a mystical sounding title, Zukav really doesn't spend that much time discussing Eastern philosophy except to point out the obvious: that both physics and Eastern philosophy suggest that 'we are all connected'.The bulk of the book is really more a primer on quantum mechanics from a non-mathematical perspective. Zukav did an excellent job (in my humble layman's opinion), of covering the history and evolution of thought in physics AND relating the basics of quantum mechanics in a very logical, relatable, manner. I should be clear though, this isn't a book for scientists. It's a book for the fans-- for people who wonder in awe at the nature of the universe and want to know more about all this cool weird shit going in at the subatomic level while still keeping our day jobs. If you want to debate the utility of the S-Matrix, this book is not for you. Put it down and go read something else. [Responding to some 2* reviews, here]But if you think physics is super cool and you want to get a good historical overview of how quantum theory came to be.... you'll be pretty happy with this one. One last thing- don't be put off by the publication date (1979). The scope of the book will still do well to give you a solid basis on which to go read about the standard model or string theory later if you want. Scope: Newton, the Great Machine, Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, Planck's Constant, Einstien, photoelectric effect, double-slit experiment, wave-particle duality, wave function, probability function, Theory of Measurement, Many Worlds Interpretation, Schroedinger's Cat, quantum model of the atom, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, S-Matrix, Special Theory of Relativity, Galilean relativity, Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz transformations, General Theory of Relativity, space-time, mass-energy, gravity and acceleration, black holes, particle physics, quantum numbers, angular momentum, anti-particles, Feynman diagrams, strong/weak forces, S-Matrix, Bell's Theorem, polarization of light, superpositions, quantum topology, superdeterminism, quantum logic, philosophy of quantum mechanics.

92,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13542582-bohdan-pechenyak,5,"By now a classic lay introduction into the intricacies of the quantum physics (the ""new physics"") as seen through the prism of a non-specialist (with all the corresponding shortcomings, which are, however, easily remedied). Some metaphors and parallels borrowed from the Buddhist and Taoist worldviews are introduced to emphasize the relation between the quantum physics and the phenomena of consciousness and psychological functioning. This ""parallelism"" between natural science and Eastern mysticism (""emptiness"", ""entanglement"", ""impermanence"" and so on) continue to be explored and criticized by various thinkers. Whatever one's position, it is impossible to deny that these considerations raise many philosophical and cosmological questions that are important to entertain and to grapple with even today. The field of quantum physics has progressed since 1979, when this book was published, but the fundamental dilemmas and philosophical implications still have not been worked through - if they ever can be, to be fair. That uncertainty and fluidity may also be seen as a parallel with some of the more ancient worldviews, from presocratic Greek philosophers, to Eastern philosophies of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. Along with Fritjof Capra's ""The Tao of Physics"" (1975), ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" (Wu Li meaning ""patterns of organic energy"" in Chinese, referring to the field of physics; and the ""dance"" referring to the quantum processes of energy/mass fluctuations) was instrumental in reviving the interest in serious examination of the quantum theory in 1970s and 1980s.

93,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"In 2020 this book is a bit dated in terms of the science it presents as cutting edge. Nonetheless, it is still directly captures and was part of the movement within theoretical physics to equate the mysteries of Quantum Mechanics and Astrophysics with Eastern mysticism.Zukav does a pretty good job of going over the basic principles within physics, and some of the weirder challenges facing physicists/scientists construction of cutting edge scientific theories. He then compares this to a multi-faceted approach of Chinese religious/philosophy surrounding the term ""Wu Li"". He uses the multi-faceted meanings of this term to frame the challenges facing science.One way to understand the use of terms/concepts borrowed from religion/mysticism is to see that when faced with too much complexity, people will nominalize the complexity with quasi-religious or mystically-inspired terminology. All in all this is an easy book to read, and Zukav very poetically captures a way to synthesize the concepts of ""change"" and ""states"" together."
94,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721532-subramanian,5,"This book in short is ""subatomic physics made approachable"".This is a book that should be read by everyone - Gary does not teach, he instead invites you to celebrate his dance with deep concepts. You get curious, you laugh - and all the time you are learning new physics. Its an incredible journey through subatomic physics - and it makes one aware of concepts like Shrodinger's cat paradox, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, light as a particle and as a wave etc. in a very light, very readable format.If you like the book (most probable in my view!) - you may want to also read Frijtof Capra's ""Tao of Physics"" which explores parallels between subatomic physics and ancient philosophy (hinduism/ tao etc). if you'd prefer a detour exploring emerging consciousness instead - read Zukuv's excellent second book ""The seat of the soul."""

How does an overview take that much ink?And, if you know some math and some physics terminology like I do, and, you are willing to work through the discussions he presents, you will be rewarded. I was. It's all about the shortcomings in Einstein's theories...and the impact on our reality. This was published in 1979, so even though it's got lots of info that most of us don't know, it's still out-dated.

Yes, time marches on and new discoveries astound and new theories flourish, but you can't do better for an introduction to the subatomic realm than Zukav's book.

180,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25352440-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,3,"This is a book written by a non-physicist that argues how the cutting edge quantum mechanics connect back to buddhist and other wisdom. I do not buy the argument at all, but I think the author tried quite a bit to understand and to convey his understanding about the particle physics. Some of his explanations should be useful as a connecting thread for a more detailed treatment.I started reading it in the middle of july it is middle of october now and I could not finish reading the last 10 or so pages, the connection he was trying to establish between physics and the old wisdom became too suffocating -- to which he might have said, ""Nonsense is that which does not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have superimposed on reality."" Anyways, I think there are still interesting parts here and there, some are as follows:1.""Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however they may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way to open the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all of the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. [Einstein]""2. ""Then physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of atomic phenomena, thereby 'proving' that atoms exist. Of course, what they really proved was that the theoretical existence of atoms was the best explanation of the experimental data that anyone could invent at that time.""3. ""The idea that we do not understand something until we have a picture of it in our heads is a by-product of the Newtonian way of looking at the world. If we want to get past Newton, we have to get past that.""4. ""Quantum theory can predict the probability of a microscopic event with the same precision that Newtonian physics can predict the actual occurrence of a macroscopic event.""5. ""The point of view that we can be without a point of view is a point of view.""6. ""Subatomic particles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere.""7. ""A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a thing which is confined to a region in space. ... It is either here or it is there, but it cannot be both here and there at the same time. ... If it is both places at once, then it is not a particle.""8. ""A proof only proves that we are playing by the rules. (We make the rules, anyway.)""9. ""Access to physical world is through experience. The common denominator of all experiences is the 'I' that does the experiencing. In short, what we experience is not external reality, but our interaction with it.""10. ""What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning. [Heisenberg]""11. ""The first man to see an illusion by which men have flourished for centuries surely stands in a lonely place. [about Einstein.]""12. ""Before Einstein, the totalitarian grasp of 'common sense' held the constancy of the speed of light to the status of a paradox. (Whenever we bump into the limits of out self-imposed cognitive reality, the result is always a paradox.)""13. ""According to the special theory of relativity, a moving object appears to contract in the direction of motion as its velocity increases. James Terrell, a physicist, has demonstrated mathematically that this phenomenon is something like a visual illusion, and, in fact, is analogous to a projection of the real world onto the wall of Plato's cave.""14. ""A rational mind, based on the impressions that it receives from its limited perspective, forms structures which thereafter determine what it further will and will not accept freely. From that point on, regardless of how the real world actually operates, this rational mind, following its self-imposed rules, tries to superimpose on the real world its own version of what must be."""
181,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/680845-meghan,4,"For such a mystical sounding title, Zukav really doesn't spend that much time discussing Eastern philosophy except to point out the obvious: that both physics and Eastern philosophy suggest that 'we are all connected'.The bulk of the book is really more a primer on quantum mechanics from a non-mathematical perspective. Zukav did an excellent job (in my humble layman's opinion), of covering the history and evolution of thought in physics AND relating the basics of quantum mechanics in a very logical, relatable, manner. I should be clear though, this isn't a book for scientists. It's a book for the fans-- for people who wonder in awe at the nature of the universe and want to know more about all this cool weird shit going in at the subatomic level while still keeping our day jobs. If you want to debate the utility of the S-Matrix, this book is not for you. Put it down and go read something else. [Responding to some 2* reviews, here]But if you think physics is super cool and you want to get a good historical overview of how quantum theory came to be.... you'll be pretty happy with this one. One last thing- don't be put off by the publication date (1979). The scope of the book will still do well to give you a solid basis on which to go read about the standard model or string theory later if you want. Scope: Newton, the Great Machine, Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, Planck's Constant, Einstien, photoelectric effect, double-slit experiment, wave-particle duality, wave function, probability function, Theory of Measurement, Many Worlds Interpretation, Schroedinger's Cat, quantum model of the atom, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, S-Matrix, Special Theory of Relativity, Galilean relativity, Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz transformations, General Theory of Relativity, space-time, mass-energy, gravity and acceleration, black holes, particle physics, quantum numbers, angular momentum, anti-particles, Feynman diagrams, strong/weak forces, S-Matrix, Bell's Theorem, polarization of light, superpositions, quantum topology, superdeterminism, quantum logic, philosophy of quantum mechanics.

Some metaphors and parallels borrowed from the Buddhist and Taoist worldviews are introduced to emphasize the relation between the quantum physics and the phenomena of consciousness and psychological functioning. This ""parallelism"" between natural science and Eastern mysticism (""emptiness"", ""entanglement"", ""impermanence"" and so on) continue to be explored and criticized by various thinkers. Whatever one's position, it is impossible to deny that these considerations raise many philosophical and cosmological questions that are important to entertain and to grapple with even today. The field of quantum physics has progressed since 1979, when this book was published, but the fundamental dilemmas and philosophical implications still have not been worked through - if they ever can be, to be fair. That uncertainty and fluidity may also be seen as a parallel with some of the more ancient worldviews, from presocratic Greek philosophers, to Eastern philosophies of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. Along with Fritjof Capra's ""The Tao of Physics"" (1975), ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" (Wu Li meaning ""patterns of organic energy"" in Chinese, referring to the field of physics; and the ""dance"" referring to the quantum processes of energy/mass fluctuations) was instrumental in reviving the interest in serious examination of the quantum theory in 1970s and 1980s.

Some metaphors and parallels borrowed from the Buddhist and Taoist worldviews are introduced to emphasize the relation between the quantum physics and the phenomena of consciousness and psychological functioning. This ""parallelism"" between natural science and Eastern mysticism (""emptiness"", ""entanglement"", ""impermanence"" and so on) continue to be explored and criticized by various thinkers. Whatever one's position, it is impossible to deny that these considerations raise many philosophical and cosmological questions that are important to entertain and to grapple with even today. The field of quantum physics has progressed since 1979, when this book was published, but the fundamental dilemmas and philosophical implications still have not been worked through - if they ever can be, to be fair. That uncertainty and fluidity may also be seen as a parallel with some of the more ancient worldviews, from presocratic Greek philosophers, to Eastern philosophies of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. Along with Fritjof Capra's ""The Tao of Physics"" (1975), ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" (Wu Li meaning ""patterns of organic energy"" in Chinese, referring to the field of physics; and the ""dance"" referring to the quantum processes of energy/mass fluctuations) was instrumental in reviving the interest in serious examination of the quantum theory in 1970s and 1980s.

Nonetheless, it is still directly captures and was part of the movement within theoretical physics to equate the mysteries of Quantum Mechanics and Astrophysics with Eastern mysticism.Zukav does a pretty good job of going over the basic principles within physics, and some of the weirder challenges facing physicists/scientists construction of cutting edge scientific theories. He then compares this to a multi-faceted approach of Chinese religious/philosophy surrounding the term ""Wu Li"". He uses the multi-faceted meanings of this term to frame the challenges facing science.One way to understand the use of terms/concepts borrowed from religion/mysticism is to see that when faced with too much complexity, people will nominalize the complexity with quasi-religious or mystically-inspired terminology. All in all this is an easy book to read, and Zukav very poetically captures a way to synthesize the concepts of ""change"" and ""states"" together."

You get curious, you laugh - and all the time you are learning new physics. Its an incredible journey through subatomic physics - and it makes one aware of concepts like Shrodinger's cat paradox, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, light as a particle and as a wave etc. in a very light, very readable format.If you like the book (most probable in my view!) - you may want to also read Frijtof Capra's ""Tao of Physics"" which explores parallels between subatomic physics and ancient philosophy (hinduism/ tao etc). if you'd prefer a detour exploring emerging consciousness instead - read Zukuv's excellent second book ""The seat of the soul."""

How does an overview take that much ink?And, if you know some math and some physics terminology like I do, and, you are willing to work through the discussions he presents, you will be rewarded. I was. It's all about the shortcomings in Einstein's theories...and the impact on our reality.

270,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25352440-mohammad-tanviruzzaman,3,"This is a book written by a non-physicist that argues how the cutting edge quantum mechanics connect back to buddhist and other wisdom. I do not buy the argument at all, but I think the author tried quite a bit to understand and to convey his understanding about the particle physics. Some of his explanations should be useful as a connecting thread for a more detailed treatment.I started reading it in the middle of july it is middle of october now and I could not finish reading the last 10 or so pages, the connection he was trying to establish between physics and the old wisdom became too suffocating -- to which he might have said, ""Nonsense is that which does not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have superimposed on reality."" Anyways, I think there are still interesting parts here and there, some are as follows:1.""Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however they may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our endeavor to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way to open the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all of the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. [Einstein]""2. ""Then physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of atomic phenomena, thereby 'proving' that atoms exist. Of course, what they really proved was that the theoretical existence of atoms was the best explanation of the experimental data that anyone could invent at that time.""3. ""The idea that we do not understand something until we have a picture of it in our heads is a by-product of the Newtonian way of looking at the world. If we want to get past Newton, we have to get past that.""4. ""Quantum theory can predict the probability of a microscopic event with the same precision that Newtonian physics can predict the actual occurrence of a macroscopic event.""5. ""The point of view that we can be without a point of view is a point of view.""6. ""Subatomic particles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere.""7. ""A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a thing which is confined to a region in space. ... It is either here or it is there, but it cannot be both here and there at the same time. ... If it is both places at once, then it is not a particle.""8. ""A proof only proves that we are playing by the rules. (We make the rules, anyway.)""9. ""Access to physical world is through experience. The common denominator of all experiences is the 'I' that does the experiencing. In short, what we experience is not external reality, but our interaction with it.""10. ""What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning. [Heisenberg]""11. ""The first man to see an illusion by which men have flourished for centuries surely stands in a lonely place. [about Einstein.]""12. ""Before Einstein, the totalitarian grasp of 'common sense' held the constancy of the speed of light to the status of a paradox. (Whenever we bump into the limits of out self-imposed cognitive reality, the result is always a paradox.)""13. ""According to the special theory of relativity, a moving object appears to contract in the direction of motion as its velocity increases. James Terrell, a physicist, has demonstrated mathematically that this phenomenon is something like a visual illusion, and, in fact, is analogous to a projection of the real world onto the wall of Plato's cave.""14. ""A rational mind, based on the impressions that it receives from its limited perspective, forms structures which thereafter determine what it further will and will not accept freely. From that point on, regardless of how the real world actually operates, this rational mind, following its self-imposed rules, tries to superimpose on the real world its own version of what must be."""

Zukav did an excellent job (in my humble layman's opinion), of covering the history and evolution of thought in physics AND relating the basics of quantum mechanics in a very logical, relatable, manner. I should be clear though, this isn't a book for scientists. It's a book for the fans-- for people who wonder in awe at the nature of the universe and want to know more about all this cool weird shit going in at the subatomic level while still keeping our day jobs. If you want to debate the utility of the S-Matrix, this book is not for you. Put it down and go read something else. [Responding to some 2* reviews, here]But if you think physics is super cool and you want to get a good historical overview of how quantum theory came to be.... you'll be pretty happy with this one. One last thing- don't be put off by the publication date (1979). The scope of the book will still do well to give you a solid basis on which to go read about the standard model or string theory later if you want. Scope: Newton, the Great Machine, Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, Planck's Constant, Einstien, photoelectric effect, double-slit experiment, wave-particle duality, wave function, probability function, Theory of Measurement, Many Worlds Interpretation, Schroedinger's Cat, quantum model of the atom, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, S-Matrix, Special Theory of Relativity, Galilean relativity, Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz transformations, General Theory of Relativity, space-time, mass-energy, gravity and acceleration, black holes, particle physics, quantum numbers, angular momentum, anti-particles, Feynman diagrams, strong/weak forces, S-Matrix, Bell's Theorem, polarization of light, superpositions, quantum topology, superdeterminism, quantum logic, philosophy of quantum mechanics.

But the more I read, the more turgid and incomprehensible it gradually became, until I was utterly relieved when it ended. Also, the male-gendered language is such a shame, mars any book for me."
288,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71103538-krokki,5,"The quantum world is freaky & fantastic, and I'm absolutley awestruck by it. Gary Zukav presents the new physics (although is not so new anymore) in a fun and entertaining way, wich is at most times easy to grasp for a curious amateur with no mathathical background. ""The more you know, the more you know that you dont know""Oh Aristotle, you rascal!"
289,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8702286-trudy,2,"It is from the 1980s so in that sense, it is dated. However, it provides a good overview of quantum physics, at least as it was at the time, in a very non-expert reader-friendly way. I would say it is very entertaining, as well, and challenges one to exercise one's neurons. However, I would not recommend it nowadays for people wanting to be better informed about current physics. "

But having said that it shouldn’t be your only introductory book. I found the comparisons to eastern religion more of an intrusion than helpful, but that part of the book was easy to ignore."
291,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7435517-jason-nadal,2,"The topic is very engaging, but lost me on the Zen comparisons it tries too hard to sell. Starts slow and then gets slower from there. It does however do a very good job of simplifying the quantum concepts which are pretty hard to grasp usually."
292,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18336884-linda,4,"I don't like to leave books I start unfinished. It took me almost five years to get through this one in little bits and pieces. There's a lot in it that went flying over my head, but I grasped enough to say that I'm glad I read it. "
293,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86730216-john-e,3,"Mental gymnasticsZukav takes you on a deep dive into the pool of quantum mechanics. Once you get out of that pool, you have a notion of just how much you -and the experts- don’t understand about our universe. Amazing."
294,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2826477-beingcristina,4,"This book only goes on to say that Science is not just limited to matter and/or mathematics. Metaphysics and mysticism could be a part of the universal world/reality until proven wrong, which, haven't been done hitherto. It's a beautiful read and highly recommended."

296,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68543561-luc-vors,5,Seminal. Yet the content dates back centuries. Wow. This one gets 7 stars. 
297,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73339966-jeanne,5,Fascinating! A solid yet entertaining introduction to anyone with an amateur interest in quantum physics.
298,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48642858-nadine-nelson-manning,5,One of my favorite all time books!
299,0060959681,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81513570-alexandra-anthony,3,"As someone who’s interested in physics and how things work, I had high hopes. I’m not sure if it’s his writing style, but I could not follow any of it. "
