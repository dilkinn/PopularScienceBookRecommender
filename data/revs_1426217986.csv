DDT, transfats, E-cigarettes, eugenics, vitamin C, nitrogen, lobotomy, etc all seemed fair for its days but stupid to barbaric in hindsight.One must say, to humankind's defense, that some of the mistakes couldn´t be foreseen and that good intention had a bad outcome nobody can be blamed for, especially regarding the right balance between the overuse or ban of DDT or how to have a healthy diet. In other cases, at least a bit of common sense or less corruption could have helped in preventing small to large scale catastrophes, but faith and big money did their thing and it escalated quickly. What is there to learn for the future from all of this?As horrible as some of the results of science gone wrong may seem, as tiny and unimportant they may be in retrospective because with the further development of technology the potential for the ultimate, earth-shattering, all-destroying mega fail comes closer. We just played around with some environment, animals, chemicals, our health and bodies, nuclear bombs, but still nothing like an ultimate pandemic or other man-made catastrophes like green/grey goo, runaway greenhouse effects, conscious AIs, poisoning, mutating, sterilizing or maddening humanity, habitat loss, etc..Even those scary dangers are nothing, because they still stay humanmade and limited to a certain area or planet (except of grey goo of course) and don´t play with elemental forces. But manipulating physics may be the greatest lunacy, because already with the nuclear bomb they didn´t know when and if the chain reaction will stop and simply did it. It´s simple good or bad luck that will determine if we will find an ultimate energy source, technology or knowledge or destroy ourselves while tinkering with it.Of course, there always stays the option to get genocidal without any reason, perverting high or low technology by just using our wetware in inventing new stupid ideologies as reasons to hate and kill each other, like for instance in future between genetic enhanced and normal people, cyborgs and normal people, normal people vs normal people because of any of the many stupid reasons seen in history or by adapting them, etc.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researchhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor..."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"For the most part, I really enjoyed this book. However, there is one negative for me and it is a big one, knocking this off the 5 star shelf down to 4. I'll get the reason for it out of the way first, and then let you know why I mostly loved it. The title is misleading. Maybe that doesn't sound like enough of a reason to warrant chipping off an entire star from the rating, but here's why: When a large portion of the American public distrusts science and the scientific process, saying the book is about SCIENCE gone wrong is just not a good thing. It's not SCIENCE that is wrong. It is people taking scientific results and either manipulating them to suit their own purposes, or jumping the gun and not collecting enough data before implementing something. It's not a ""sin of science""; it's human beings' ignorance or manipulation of the facts. The ""sins"" in this book were almost always done by people who were not themselves scientists, and it was BECAUSE they didn't follow the scientific process that they went so horribly wrong. The scientific process is our best way to know and understand ourselves and the world. To imply that science is to blame for man's stupidity is a huge disservice to humanity, especially when people distrust it anyway, thinking the opinion of some 30 year old guy living in his mommy's basement venting BS on Facebook is just as valid as that of an esteemed scientist. Many Americans (and certainly some people in other countries as well) believe the world is 6,000 years old, human beings rode around on dinosaurs, a great flood covering the entire earth is how the Grand Canyon was ""created"", evolution is untrue, vaccines cause autism, climate change is a conspiracy, etc. etc. etc. So that's why I have such a major beef with the title of this book, and the author's or publisher's decision to add a subtitle that seems to assert that the problems discussed in the book are the fault of science. Not true. OK, glad to get that off my chest! Despite all of that, this book was still a lot of fun to read. I learned a lot, and for me, that is what is most important about a book. My brain is a fact junkie; I get a sort of high, a jolt of major feel-goodedness when I learn something new. Paul Offit discusses seven cases where people have misused science, either because they didn't wait for enough data to be collected, or because they simply ignored it. For instance, in the pursuit of a non-addictive and safe pain reliever, pharmaceutical companies kept marketing ever more addicting opioid products, claiming they were safe. In 1898 one needed a prescription for aspirin, but heroin was sold over the counter as a panacea, treating everything from tuberculosis to headaches! Eventually, they would create Oxycontin, the most addictive of all opioids/opiates so far, leading to the current heroin addiction crisis now plaguing cities and towns across America and is now the leading cause of accidental death in more than 30 states.Another chapter deals with mental health treatments that did more harm than good, such as various shock ""therapies"" and lobotomies. There was no scientific data showing that lobotomies were safe, and yet Drs. Egas Moniz and Almeida Lima, ""without performing a single experiment on an animal and spending only an afternoon practicing the procedure on a cadaver—had picked their first patient."" More than 20,000 people would have parts of their brains chopped out over the coming decades. Another sort of ""snake oil"" treatment that people still follow today was begun by one man's claims that since vitamins found in food are beneficial for us, large quantities of them in supplemental form would be even better, prolonging lives even. Instead, we now know that large doses of supplemental vitamins are harmful for us and are more likely to cause cancer than prevent it. I am glad to have my own misassumption about Vitamin C set straight; along with untold others, I believed that taking a large amount of Vitamin C in supplement form could prevent a cold from coming on, or make its duration shorter if I caught it. This is untrue; it has no effect at all. It is much better to get your Vitamin C from food; an example is the apple, half of which ""has the antioxidant activity of 1,500 milligrams of vitamin C, even though it contains only 5.7 milligrams of the vitamin""... and doesn't cause liver damage or heart disease!Paul Offit also discusses things like cancer screenings, of which many (not all) are now being reevaluated for their usefulness. He discusses vaccines, BPA, DDT, and GMOs, telling how myths have arisen and spread about them. The false claims that were made about these and other products still persist and sometimes cause even more suffering from not utilizing them. For instance, ""GMO technology has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent [and] increased crop yields by 22 percent"" yet many people believe they are harmful in and of themselves, even though humans have been genetically modifying our crops and animals through selective or artificial breeding for thousands of years.There are many interesting things talked about in this book, many myths debunked. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who look at the title and go, ""SEE! I told you you can't trust them satan-loving scientists! Science is bad, bad, bad and to prove it to you, I'll put it on Facebook with my new iPhone, because THAT! THAT makes it true!"". “The trouble with the world is not that people know too little; it’s that they know so many things that just aren’t so.” ~Mark Twain"
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16024049-mompkin,1,"This is by far the longest review I’ve ever written, but I feel like it is my responsibility, as a scientist interested in education, to fully express the degree to which this book is problematic and misleading. The premise of Pandora’s lab is to discuss ‘surprising’ examples of ‘science gone bad.’ There are many issues with this, but one of the biggest is that if you have read other science books or listened to pretty much any podcast, you will already be familiar with most of these stories, told in a better and more interesting way. Most of the time in the book, I wanted to wave my hand and say “yeah yeah we all have heard this story before many times.” So, hardly surprising. Add to this the fact that the writing is an unfortunate combination of perfunctory and polemical styles, and one quickly comes to the conclusion that a reader would be much better off finding other, much better written books than this one. A second problematic component is that the book is, more often than not, discussing stances and opinions held by people in spite of, not because of, the general scientific consensus. It’s unclear, for most of the stories, how the bad which emerges has anything to do with science. It generally takes the stance that society should base decisions on science, not whackadoodle unfounded claims unbacked by most scientists. This really has nothing to do with science going bad, it has to do with collective groups of people making ill-fated decisions in spite of the scientific evidence. The tagline of the book is fundamentally misleading, but this is not its only sin.The book also makes the dangerously naïve argument that data and facts exist objectively, outside of scientific paradigms and cultural frameworks, if only we look behind the curtain. This is not how science has ever worked or will ever work in the future. There is no such thing as objective data collection or data analysis. There is no such thing as objective research, and it is not possible to objectively evaluate the value of a scientific theory, outside of any societal context. It is only possible to conduct science from within a scientist’s experiential framework, and all scientists are people who participate in society and exist in a culture. It is not possible to understand the mistakes of the past and learn how to avoid similar mistakes in the future using this ill-informed and nonsensical concept of ‘objective data.’ As Offit does not seem to realize this, the book simply cannot offer any useful insight. I would recommend that Offit read pretty much any book about the history or philosophy of science, to better understand how flawed one of the main messages of the book is.In a rather ironic twist, given the premise of his book and his frequent declarations that ‘it’s all about the data,’ he has an entire chapter devoted to the poorly researched argument that the publication of Silent Spring directly led to hundreds of millions of people dying of malaria. This is inaccurate on many levels. First, while DDT was banned in the united states, it was not banned worldwide. It was not even fully banned in the united states – it was permitted for use in cases of public health, just not for agricultural purposes. In fact, the US still manufactures and exports DDT-laced mosquito nets as part of various aid programs. DDT has continued to be and still is used to control malaria-carrying mosquitos. The main reason why its use today has declined so much is that it is not particularly cost-effective anymore when used as a fogging agent, and countries which struggle with chronic malaria outbreaks generally have found that other approaches besides area fogging are cheaper and save more lives, and only makes sense when used in rotation with other pesticides to manage the problem of insecticide resistance. In fact, even before the publication of Silent Spring, many health officials were concerned about rapid declines in the effectiveness of DDT, as mosquitos were quickly evolving resistance to it. Alarmed articles from the late 1950s and early 60s can be found which panic about how DDT is no longer effectively controlling malaria. Declines in the efficacy of DDT, along with the myopic behavior of reducing funding as soon as malaria cases dropped (only to balloon back up again without further preventative measures) explain why DDT use declined over time. In the late 1950’s, DDT use in the US had declined precipitously, with only 1/10th of the volume which was produced in 1950 being produced in 1960. But Silent Spring didn’t come out until 1962. Oops. How can one possibly make the argument that the book is single-handedly responsible for the decline in DDT use if was already declining? The arguments in this entire chapter are easy to refute, in part because the author just seems to have read the talking points from one of the many right-wing crank websites decrying Silent Spring. This is especially evident when looking at the sources for this chapter, which seem to be predominantly secondary sources (either nut-job books or blogs). Unfortunately, in re-using these commonly used arguments, the author should have maybe spent a bit more time doing research, as even the Wikipedia page on DDT has all the information necessary to refute the arguments made in this book. When a 5-minute read of a Wikipedia page demonstrates that an author doesn’t know what they are talking about, it’s hard to have faith in their ability to read and understand scientific literature. Ironic given the basis of the book, I know. The author raises good points about Carson over-reaching beyond the scope of the data and trumpeting sensationalist conclusions not based on meticulous science, but then he goes on to do exactly the same thing, only in the opposite direction. Moderately hilarious, except for how depressing it is.This book also contains such revelations as “famous old people sometimes say dumb things, even when they’re scientists.” If you didn’t know this, then you have probably never read the news, or a nonfiction book. If this is indeed your first nonfiction book, boy are you in for a treat! There are lots of them, and most of them are better than this one!I do have to admit that the chapter discussing Haber was interesting, as I knew much of the history surrounding the Haber-Bosch process, but I did not really know the full history of Haber as a scientist, and I enjoyed learning his complicated and tragic story. More than anything, I’m confused as to how the stories in this book relate to concerns about science. Most of the examples are of how people will say and do things in spite of science, and how society as a whole often prefers to ignore inconvenient evidence. I’m not sure how bad things that happen because rigorous science was ignored are examples of ‘science gone wrong.’ It’s examples of people preferring convenient pseudoscience to complicated and nuanced rigorous science, and how, believe it or not, this can lead to ill-informed conclusions. As an example, Offit seems to attribute the entire supplement industry to Linus Pauling’s addled claims about vitamin C. This makes no sense, as since the beginning of time people have clamored to buy miracle quick fix tonics and supplements, never with any evidence to support their efficacy aside from the sensationalist claims of the hawkers, and often in direct contradiction of the general scientific consensus. This problem has nothing to do with ‘science gone wrong.’ Indeed, despite overwhelmingly universal scientific consensus that homeopathy makes no sense, it has been popular for over a hundred years. It is not an example of science gone wrong, but inexplicably Offit acts as if the ill-advised comment of one prominent scientist in support of it is the only reason why homeopathy exists. If it was popular before the comment, and continued to be popular after the comment, how can one possibly attribute its popularity to a single comment made far after its worldwide spread? Offit does not seem to understand that there are powerful psychological factors which play into the continued popularity of pseudo-science. He instead is under the simplistic impression that if you show people a pile of data and tell them they are dumb, they will change their perspective, despite reams of scientific evidence that this is now how human minds typically work. Thus, even his well-intentioned recommendations at the end of the book to be more data-literate and listen less to sensationalist pseudoscience in the news is not helpful, new, or insightful advice. I’m pretty sure this the 1,000,000th book to recommend that the general culture should be more attentive and nuanced when drawing conclusions about science. This advice is also not helpful, and research on science communication generally demonstrates that, when trying to educate the public using the style recommended by Offit in the book, not only is this communication style ineffective, but it often has the opposite effect, entrenching the opposing viewpoint in the listener even further.So, overall, we have a not particularly well written book, recycling old material into an ineffective format, while also introducing some woefully inaccurate information, and which demonstrates the author’s fundamental misunderstanding of how both science and society work. I cannot possibly recommend this book to anyone. While the author may have thought he was performing a public service by writing this book, I fear it is at best harmless and at worst horrendously misleading."

Let me start of by saying that I'm not a big nonfiction reader, so the fact that I'm giving this almost five stars definitely says something about how accessible and interesting the content is. The author looks at different inventions, most of them well intentioned, which had unforeseen, detrimental sometimes even disastrous consequences. It reads like a who's who of Nobel prize winners. Although the discoveries and consequences are interesting enough, the author provides us with:-thought-provoking facts (as rates of immigration have increased rates of crime have decreased), -wonderful tidbits (because the principal distributors of heroin in the 1920's were three Jewish mobsters, heroin was often called ""smack"", from the Yiddish word for schmecher, meaning ""addict""), -beautiful quotes (""Harmony among peoples come from the true principles and attitudes of the present, not from purging the past."") and- the lessons we should learn from mistakes made in the seven examples. I personally think the one lesson we, as consumers, should heed is Beware the Quick Fix. We're so used to getting everything right now, and this makes impatient for an easy solutionIf you enjoyed  Freakanomics you will love this. In fact even if you've never tried anything similar before, this is a good place to start. It was entertaining, thought-provoking and well-written.Sonja, thanks so much for gently insisting that I read this."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"Eye-widening, well-told tales of science gone wrong, Pandora's box is not a harangue against science. I hate the war on science that is going on in the United States right now.This isn't that; it's a treatise on what goes wrong when ""mostly"" well meaning people promote pseudoscience to either make money, become famous, or out of willful ignorance.The most horrific and poignant stories to me were the ones about forced sterilization and lobotomy that took place in the United States. Forced sterilization took place in America so that we could hold on to our ""superior Nordic genes"". The proponents of this movement first legislated to have less immigrants with bad genes into the U.S., but soon they were not content with keeping the bad blood out, they decided to tackle the problem from within by sterilizing , . . . '""the poor, syphilitic, feebleminded, insane, alcoholic, deformed, lawbreaking, or epileptic Americans in 32 states. . ."" All together over 65,000 citizens were sterilized, many without consent or knowledge of what was being done to them. This Eugenics program soon spread to other countries and was taken up enthusiastically by Germany and led directly to the Holocaust.The story of lobotomy is also a dark blot on American history. This movement was primarily the work of one man, Walter Freeman, a doctor with no surgical training. At first, he teamed with a brain surgeon to perform this technique of boring a hole in the brain and removing tissue, but later developed something called the ice pick lobotomy in which he drove an ice pick into the person's eye socket, then hit it with a mallet and wiggled the ice pick around and proceeded to do the same thing in the other eye, all without anesthesia and without wearing gloves or a mask. Most patients were women and did not want it. From 1936 until 1951, Freeman and his trainees preformed 18,000 lobotomies. Freeman became discredited and lost his medical degree eventually, but not before people were killed from the ""surgery"" or were left completely unable to function afterwards. He also operated on little children, one boy was only four.Offit, the author, leaves us with some hope, like Pandora, that these types of things can be avoided in future, but it is up to us to be careful and look to rigorous, scientific studies and not to rely on hearsay or the internet or the current zeitgeist."

In fact, this chapter succinctly outlines the fertile ground out of which Adolf Hitler’s beliefs grew.There are many varied scientific discoveries dissected. From the invention of lobotomies, the megavitamin industry, the AIDS/HIV denial debacle that killed hundreds of thousands of people in SA and across the world (I am referring to you Thabo Mbeki), to the hype around e-cigarettes. Even them crazy scientologists get a turn with their claim that autism is caused by worms.Our history is riddled with scientific breakthroughs but also scientific disasters. The main theme with most of the scientist in this book, which include Nobel Prize winners, is that they just never thought that they could be wrong. About anything. Ever. “Every claim, independent of a scientist’s reputation, should stand on a mountain of evidence”“There is a fine line between genius and madness”The last 1/3 reminded me of Bad Science but unlike Bad Science there are no long sections explaining research methodologies ad nauseum. The writing is very accessible and easy to grasp.The author also makes extremely compelling (and controversial) arguments against the overuse of certain cancer screenings, using apt analogies so anyone can understand the science-speak.This is not a book to read just to get funny dinnertime anecdotes. There are some real lessons to learn from our past mistakes. The thing I appreciated the most is that the author did not just slam down the perceived villains of the stories. When applicable he also outlined the astounding contributions these same mad scientists made to mankind.HIGHLY recommended."

But for me the most surprising chapter was on Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. I don't believe going into this book that anyone could convince me, a vegetarian, organic crop lover that DDT might be a good thing, but Offit actually did and that alone makes the book worth reading."

I learned a lot from this and have already recommended it to two people. He provides great histories, strong data, and wraps up the ""seven stories"" with great rules about spotting fakes and charlatans. "
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,3,"Pandora's Lab examines seven scientific breakthroughs that ultimately lead us in the wrong direction, and considers what lessons we might learn from them so that we don't make the same mistakes again.On the one hand, this is a fascinating and thought-provoking book. One of the highlights for me was the chapter about opioid addiction. Offit manages to succinctly describe the history of this class of drugs, starting from the opium poppy plant to its recent chemical formulations that have led to a staggering addiction crisis. This chapter puts into perspective and helped me understand this drug, its allure, addictive properties, and chemical evolution in a way that multiple standalone books in the past have not done.Another chapter I really enjoyed is the one on margarine. I appreciated Offit's straightforward, scientific writing and the way he broke down the differences between the fats. In particular, he made it easy to understand what is so special and dangerous about trans fat, and what to watch out for when grocery shopping.In general, I found most of the seven stories to be insightful, but the chapter on DDT was a huge exception. Offit argues that Rachel Carson, through her book Silent Spring, called forth a revolution against DDT that led to its eventual ban in the US and around the world. He harps on the fact that this anti-DDT movement was not backed at all by science. This surprised me, so I looked into it, and every article I found of reputable origin agrees that DDT does harm humans and animals, acting as an endocrine disruptor and thinning the eggshells of birds. The author didn't mention any of this, and it's clear he cherry-picked the data he included so that it supports his narrative. This chapter reads more like Offit's personal rant instead of the calm, scientific exploration it should have been.Another part of the book that disappointed me was the epilogue. In it, the author attempts to argue that e-cigarettes are not harmful because they don't cause cancer as traditional cigarettes do (since they don't have tar). I'm really surprised to read that a scientist would take such a narrow point of view on what's considered harmful, especially when he should have known that nicotine addiction is a huge issue and should not be brushed aside so lightly.Overall, this book is a mixed bag. There are some extremely informative and thought-provoking passages in here, and I learned a lot from reading this book. But at times, Offit commits the same sin he is writing about, where he lets his scientific expertise cloud his judgement and presents his personal views instead of what the data and science really shows."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"This is great overall, but the title & description are terrible. Science only went wrong in one case & that's psychiatry, a very soft science even today. Back then, it was pretty much a pseudoscience. Instead, society has cherry-picked & misused what science has discovered. I just don't see that as a failing of science & certainly not ""sins of science"" (quote from the book's description). Most of the chapter titles are mine, not his, to lend clarity. I have some real issues with some of his points & made them in the details below, but otherwise I highly recommend this book in any format. As an audiobook, it was very easy to listen to. I did get a copy of the ebook, but basically only referred to it for the review & to double check on some of the points I disagree with - mostly those surround Carson & DDT. Chapter 1 - Opiates: The use of opium predates written records for pain & other ailments. Attempts to make it less addictive have only made it more so due to a poor understanding of addiction & addicts. I'd hardly call the various mass addictions a failure of science, though. Scientists set out to change it & did. Instead of subjecting the fruits of their labor to any sort of scrutiny, companies & governments just used it until the crisis was too bad to ignore any more. It's basically the failing of greed on the part of addicts & their greedy providers: doctors, pharma, & the various governments.Chapter 2 - Transfats: Again, not a failing of science, but public figures pushing unsubstantiated claims. He especially takes the  McGovern Dietary Committee to task for this correctly, but they weren't the only ones. Dietary practices as dictated by the government & popular opinion have always had a poor record. Follow the money. It's too similar to the story of Fletcher & his chewing food to a liquid way back in the early 1900s.Chapter 3 - Haber:  Fritz Haber  figured out how to fix nitrogen from a gas into ammonia thus creating the basis for modern fertilizers & explosives. I don't see how this can be a failing of science - it simply provided a power tool to humanity. If we want to act like a child with a chainsaw, that's on society, not the science behind the discovery. We couldn't feed folks today without artificially restoring nitrogen to the soil & too much can certainly cause issues as it runs off into waterways creating algae blooms which unbalance habitats. Explosives can be used for both good & bad purposes, too. Again, not science, but Haber's & society's use is at fault.Chapter 4 - Eugenics: Offit does a good job tracing the science that led to the movement, the key public figures, & societal issues that pushed it along. He didn't mention the breed craze of the 19th century, but did well with immigration, Sanger, & others, especially Madison Grant one of the father's of the conservation movement & author of The Passing of the Great Race or the Racial Basis of European History, which Hitler called his bible. He ends especially well, warning against using pseudoscience to support the zeitgeist. Again, actual science was not at fault. Many pointed out the flaws, but they were ignored. This is all about society cherry picking to support what they wanted.Chapter 5 - Lobotomies is finally a section where science does go wrong. There was no oversight by any of organizations that could & should have done something about this. They turned a blind eye to little & bad data. Psychiatric science is an extremely soft science at best, but scooping out pieces of brain & leaving people as mindless idiots (when it didn't kill them) certainly helped alleviate the problems in crowded in mental institutions. I was disappointed that Offit didn't address why these institutions were so crowded, though. Could it have been that the people in them didn't measure up to the Cleaver's? Chapter 6 - ""The Mosquito Liberation Front"" I'm going to have to reread Silent Spring since its condemnation of DDT is what Offit says caused perhaps half a billion deaths due to not spraying for mosquitoes. I'm quite shocked at how loose Carson apparently played with the truth behind the effects of DDT. That's reprehensible, if true, & it probably is. However, Offit carefully avoids mentioning the effects it had on the rest of the environment & how they would have gotten worse over time as DDE (one component DDT breaks down into) built up in the ecosystem. In fact, he never mentions DDE at all. Instead he writes pretty much the way he accused Carson of writing - long on emotion, short of facts, although he disguises this with heart-wrenching statistics on child mortality.Chapter 7 - ""Nobel Prize Disease"" is 3 great examples, starting with Linus Pauling, where the science showed scientists were wrong, but they traded on their earlier reputations. He also shows just how stupid & gullible not only people, but institutions, can be.Chapter 8 - Summing up is worth reading even if you don't read the rest of the book. The excellent points he made throughout the book starting with 1. ""It's all about the data."" I don't think that he stressed how important it is not to rely on a single study & to make sure the data is reproducible. His next point was that 2. there's always a cost & his example is the overuse of antibiotics. Another warning is to 3. ""Beware the zeitgeist"" in which he points out how bad the current popular opinion is on GMOs & 'chemicals', a subject that infuriates me on a regular basis. Also 4. Beware the quick fix, a point he made about lobotomies. His examples of parents trying to 'cure' autism are heartbreaking.5. The dose makes the poison when coupled with mass hysteria from the above makes for really bad situations. Did Carson really create the 'zero tolerance' policy? I detest that.6. Be cautious about being too cautious. has an instructional example in BPA, but his point on cancer screening was close to perfect. So much of it is crap & it does nothing but cause problems. Great example with the animals & burning barn.7. Pay attention to the little man behind the curtain is the final point. Beware of people like Pauling when the evidence doesn't support them, especially if they attack with conspiracy theories. Wakefield is a prime example. ...As Norman Levitt, a mathematician and debunker of pseudoscience, famously said, “While Galileo was a rebel, not all rebels are Galileo”—no matter how hard they try to convince you that they are."

Offit traced the discovery and use of the poppy seed back to 4000BCE and followed its trajectory until the present day. Who could believe that inside that tiny poppy seed, there are no less than 5 potent drugs, waiting to be harvested? So much offering from one tiny seed. Inside that seed is a gum-like substance that holds the molecules that make up morphine, codeine, 2 muscle relaxants, and heroin. That tiny seed holds within it the power to heal and the power to kill. So powerful is the poppy, it can take away the pain created by cancer and other cruel diseases of life that ravage the body from the inside. I have nightmares about traveling back in time, knowing there was so little anyone could do to help people who had painful cancers, broken bones, gashes, and surgeries of various sorts. I am so happy to be alive today instead of back then, and back then wasn't even that long ago. ​Just a few decades ago, the founder of Hospice​ had to fight to make it legal to administer opioids to patients suffering unimaginable pain at the last and most cruel stages of their illnesses (it was neither legal to allow them to die, even as they begged) or to take away the pain they constantly had to endure. That is the most immoral thing I have ever heard, which always makes it so shocking to me when people make moral arguments for keeping a suffering person alive, while they have no problem allowing their beloved family pet, who is in terrible pain, to die in a peaceful and dignified way. Offit certainly extols the virtues of this wonder drug. But, as powerful as it is at taking away pain, that little poppy seed has the power to kill as well. A significant number of people die from heroin overdoses each year. D​iag​o​ra​s of Melas has been trying to warn humanity about the addictive properties of opioids since the days of the ancient Greeks. Many still ignore him today. Opioids were already a problem for Americans who took in liquid form. It became a much larger problem during the gold rush, when Chinese people came over to join in the gold rush and brought with them their opium pipes. At that point opium became a health crisis and was made illegal. The fight has been going ever since. The opioid chapter was, by far, my favorite chapter. The other subjects were not as captivating, but I mostly enjoyed the point Offit was trying to get across to readers. The goal of the book was to make the point that it is important to think critically. To create his argument, he examined the double edge sword of many advances, shining a light on the negative consequences of those advances. For example, Rachel Carson had a huge impact on making society aware of environmental concerns. Offit focused on how the reaction to her landmark book Silent Spring negatively affected the lives of people in Africa who likely died from malaria as a result of the banning of DDT. He warned against fear mongering of groups, citing some of what Trump has said about Mexicans and Muslims, and reminded us of what happened in the past when humans began singling out groups as unfit to be around the rest of society. They singled out ""imbeciles"" and forced sterilization upon them, starting what would become an every growing eugenics movement. Once you open the door to eugenics, with seemingly reasonable arguments, it is easier and easier to add requirements of these groups and more and more justifications of why it's ok to practice eugenics. He traced the concerns of imbeciles through to concerns of Jewish people in Nazi Germany. This chapter was difficult to read because it listed the horrific experiments done to 1000s of Jewish children, very few of whom survived. Related to the practices of the Nazi's, Offit wrote about Fritz Haber's scientific discovery of fixing nitrogen that allowed about 3 billion more people to be alive on this planet. However, Haber, a Jew himself, worked hard to help the Germans try to win world domination. He developed chemical weapons that were considered inhumane and seemed to have no moral qualms about using them. It was interesting to think about how easy it was for people to force ""imbeciles"" (those with an IQ of less than 70 and those who increasingly were deemed unfit, for a a number of reasons, to have offspring, and then it was fashionable to turn perfectly intelligent people into imbeciles by way of giving them ever more efficient lobotomies. He gave a great summary of what happened to poor Rosemary Kennedy, who was cruelly tricked into getting a lobotomy. It was not simply kept from her; it was kept from her poor mother as well. Joe Kennedy took matters into his own hands, using very poor critical thinking skills, and ruined his daughter's life. ​Offit also tackled perceptions surrounding GMOs and BPA. Offits main point with all of these examples was to stress the message that, in order to accept any scientific study, you must, must, must make sure the results have been replicated. It's not enough to witness a phenomenon once, even if it has been published in a scientific journal. If it can't be replicated, it should never be accepted and spread through the general public as fact. He marveled, as do I, at how some people can focus on an extreme example and make that example the rule. For instance, the live polio vaccine did have a chance of giving a child polio but the chances of that were so much lower than getting polio if not for the vaccine. He, as always, had some truly great points to make about the anti-vaxx crowd. He debunked the BPA studies. I have to confess, I was very swayed by the animal studies I read about and have a hard time letting go of the BPA studies, even after reading this book. I will have to educate myself more about BPA studies in which rats were given food instead of injections, because those studies did not show negative effects of BPA. I am stunned. He suggested that BPA would have to be present at much higher levels (rats were injected with huge doses of BPA) in order to see demethylation of chromatin. I liked somethings in this book and didn't like others, but his last chapter or two was outstanding. He excels in pointing out where society fails in its critical thinking ability and always makes great points about the consequences of that lack of critical thinking. He seems particularly bothered, as am I now that I am aware, that parents of autistic kids are seeking ""cures"" from gurus instead of actual doctors and forcing their kids to swallow bleach as well as giving enemas of bleach. Apparently parents talk freely online about the suffering their children are going through, and other parents continue to support this harsh treatment, because they are sure it is worth it and sure it is working. These parents belong in jail, not surfing the net. Stupidity is fine as long as you are not ruining someone else's life because of it. If you have any say in policy or the raising of a child, you should work harder to become educated. "
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"This is a fascinating and disturbing book that covers a lot of scientists and science and non-science claiming itself to be science. I've read about some of the topics and people covered in here before in different contexts. But the way this book presents and frames these stories is intriguing, chilling and important. Scientists are driven by personal, cultural and political ideals and beliefs and also, sometimes, their desire to be right or to influence people and/or events is much more compelling to them than whether what they are doing is actually productive/helpful/beneficial/based in reality. There are pseudo-scientific 'fads' that do a lot of harm, and scientific studies done with the intention of promoting dangerous philosophies and products. So, how can we value scientific discoveries that are illuminating and worth exploring further without allowing the exploitation of scientific ideas (some of them based in some grain of truth, some of them based in none at all) that harm some groups of people and benefit others? For examples, as information about genetics became more mainstream, non-scientific ideas about a ""master race"" and ""pure genetics"" were presented as science and benefitted white supremacists/nationalists/nazis in Germany the U.S. while allowing for horrific, unspeakable brutality and violence. We've not seen or heard the end of this fiasco. And poor science led to the promotion of certain supposedly healthy foods and supplements and benefitted the people selling these products while harming people who used them.So, this book looks at seven harmful to horrific scenarios in which science is ill-used or not used at all but referred to in order to create false credibility. And in the end, the author asks, how can we learn from all this and do better in the future?I am pretty cynical in the sense that I haven't seen evidence that we (humans in larger tribal, cultural and national groupings) learn from our mistakes in a way that helps us use technology and science for 'good'. And yet, I do think it is an important book and hope it's influential. One thing that I found worrisome and upsetting, but also interesting in the sense of, even in this book it's possible the ideas held by the author are influenced by things outside of science and may be downright wrong--is a comment he made about chronic lyme on page 148 in the middle of the page. He makes what I can only read as a disparaging remark about people who ""believe"" they are suffering from ""chronic lyme disease."" I've been to doctors and have had a lot of sick friends who have been to doctors who scoff at the idea that lyme can go chronic or systemic. These doctors treat people with chronic lyme as if they are craazy. I have a hunch in not too many years, these doctors (Offit, it seems, being one of them) will be in the camp of scientists and medical practitioners who let their prejudices and self-interest get in the way of real science and real support of sick patients.

My Gripes with the Content and The Author's Opinions:Pandora's Lab fascinates you with the title, and under the guff and smoke, presents stories about the advancement of science, and the lessons that need to be learnt from the reckless pursuit of technology. At least, that is what the book claims in its first half. Lamenting on the discovery of a technology, and blaming the technology for the way it was used was something I took an immediate offense to from the very beginning. Show me a hammer, and I'll show you a murder weapon, show me fire and I'll show you an arsonist. Listing Mendel's discovery of genetics in the list of Science Gone Wrong was probably something that I took a personal offense to(because I'm a biotechnologist). Mendel's Theory of Heredity is listed here because Madison Grant wrote a pseudo-scientific treatise by drawing parallels with Mendel's work to create the theory of Nordic Races, which is the fount of all modern racism. Adolf Hitler proclaimed The Passing of The Great Races(Grant's book) to be his Bible and derived his own work Mein Kampf from it, and went on to murder innocent people.In another chapter in the book, a celebrated chemist created artificial fertilizer, and then used that fertilizer during the war to create chemical weapons and explosives. In both these cases, it is not the tool that is at fault, but the wielder. The writer initially claims that discovering a technology is like opening Pandora's box, because you never know what evils it might bring into the world, but a tool by it's very nature is innocent. The evils already exist in the world, right within us. Aside from my gripe with the author on this issue, I can wholeheartedly agree with everything else in the book. It is incredibly informative and well researched, but in some cases accurate data has been slightly skewed to help the author's point of view, so I would advise readers to take this book with a pinch of salt.Think critically, like the author encourages you to do, evaluate the facts, and trust only the data.This book can be considered a warning to everyone who would bypass the scientific method and rely on gut instinct and anecdotal or sparse evidence to propagate their claims. That, I think, is the best description of what this book really is.2. Writing StyleThe book is written beautifully, and should be simple for any reader to follow, despite the fact that it deals with complex science. There is an art to writing a scientific book in a manner that does not oversimplify the science but does not clutter it with jargon either, and this book finds that balance beautifully. I enjoyed every bit of the storytelling, and the way the facts were presented, and I would recommend this book to everyone I can. The book even highlights in many places the logic traps that we fall into while looking at stories and data, and cautions us on how to avoid them.3. Summary:Read it. Short, informative, accurate. "
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,4,"This is the story about unintended consequences, and unleashing discoveries on the world without enough testing beforehand. The frontal lobotomy, trans fats, eugenics, the synthesis of ammonium nitrate, megavitamins, opioids, and the banning of DDT are the seven that Offit has selected as big mistakes. Some, like lobotomies and trans fats, were a horrible idea from the start. Others, like ammonium nitrate and opioids, have been used indiscriminately and created problems. Offit gives a good history of each of these problems, from the discovery of the thing to today’s results. He gives a bibliography to back up his thesis, and the last chapter is a warning: how to learn from the past, and how to identify bad science. The book is well researched and well written, and is interesting from beginning to end. Do I agree with everything he says? Well, no. While I agree that deaths from overdoses of opioids are a bad thing, I certainly don’t want them not used any more. Too many people with chronic pain rely on them to get up and do a day’s work; for acute pain, as in post-surgery use, there is nothing else like them. A way needs to be found to keep them from being *over* used, rather than banning them. Yes, banning DDT meant that a number of mosquito borne diseases, which had become scarce in some area, came back with a vengeance, but I don’t agree with him that no damage was ever done with DDT. We need to find a better way, such as vaccines, to deal with those diseases, not bring back a substance that is still in every single person in the world. I do love his lessons on identifying bad science; if something seems to be the answer to all kinds of questions, it’s probably bogus. Nothing cures everything. Nothing cures without the possibility of side effects. As Heinlein said, there ain’t no such thing as free lunch. "

We often forget that what we consider advances today come at a cost. Sometimes the cost is bearable, other times it's not. Or at the very least it's not us that bear it. Smart people make mistakes. Smart people believe junk ""science"". Everyone is influenced by the cultural, political, social, economic, and scientific worlds they live in, and to pretend otherwise is naive. The path to hell is indeed often paved with good intentions, and as this book illuminates, there are many versions of hell.This book is well researched and well written, and I was horrified, educated, and fascinated from the first page to the last. I knew about some of the events in these seven chapters, but the author does a wonderful job of connecting pieces in a way I had not know about, or even considered, but I don't want to review the specific histories mentioned as that would spoil the reveal. I was really disturbed by this one, so much so that I asked my partner to also read it so I'd have someone to discuss it with. I listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Paul Tremblay, and this should be required reading for every single person, even if the last time you attended a science class was in the 7th grade. This book gave me a new framework with which to discuss these topics, educated me on things I didn't know about, and connected dots in a way that changed my understanding of the world.

Offit describes what he sees as the worst creations in history - the ones that had the most disastrous results and the longest reach. He goes over the opiod crisis, eugenics, lobotomies, and oddly enough the banning of DDT. While objectively it is difficult to say which is the worst, the one’s he addresses are really freaking bad.Here are some nuggets of information I learned from this book:Mary Todd Lincoln was addicted to laudanum (liquid opium).The term ‘junkie’ came from people sifting through junkyards looking for stuff to sell for opium.Morphine was created to treat opium additction, heroin to treat morphine addiction, and Oxy to treat heroin addiction (all derived from the poppy plant).FDA allows nutrition labels to say 0 grams trans fats if the product has less tahn .5 grams. This means people can consume more than the recommended daily dosage determined by the American Heart Association which is 2g.IBM donated machines to help Nazis figure out family trees to see who was Jewish and who wasn’t.Whenever I read nonfiction (which is admittedly seldom), I always question the credibility of the author. What makes them an authority on this topic? Why should I trust them? Paul Offit is a physician and literally created a vaccine for rotavirus. So he’s good. Even as an accomplished scientist, Offit recognizes the great harm that scientific inventions have wrought on humanity and our environment."

25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"It’s not so much the science as it is a failure to critically examine the data.The seven stories are about:1. Opium and opioids (“God’s Own Medicine”)2. Oleomargarine and trans fats (“The Great Margarine Mistake”)3. Nitrogen fertilizers and ammonium nitrate. (“Blood from Air”)4. Eugenics (“America’s Master Race”)5. Lobotomies (“Turning the Mind Inside Out”)6. Rachel Carson and DDT (“The Mosquito Liberation Front”)7. Linus Pauling and vitamin C; Peter Duesberg and AIDs; Luc Montagnier and the antibiotic “cure” for autism (“Nobel Prize Disease”)Additionally there is an eighth chapter entitled “Learning from the Past” which is about the MMR vaccine and autism, e-cigarettes, Bisphenol A, cancer screening, and GMOs.One of the themes in the book is the hubris of some very famous scientists who won Nobel prizes and then went on to do and/or promote some very bad science mainly because they could not admit they were wrong. But the real villain in these pages is not the science itself; it is instead the failure of people in the political arena, in the media and even in the medical and scientific journals to weigh the evidence properly thereby lending support to the bad science. Dr. Offit indicts the Environmental Protection Agency (p. 188); Time Magazine, Newsweek, the New York Times (p. 145); the Journal of the American Medical Association, the American Journal of Public Health, the New England Journal of Medicine (p. 124) and others (see page 226). Naturally these mistakes from prestigious organizations are reflective of earlier more ignorant times. Today most are much more thorough before passing judgement. However Offit warns near the end of the book that new mistakes by currently prestigious institutions will be made.Offit, who is a doctor of medicine and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania as well as the author of more than 160 papers in medical and scientific journals, writes in a clear and readable style that is packed with concrete detail and facts, especially historical facts, some of which are appalling and horrific.Here are some tidbits reflective of Offit’s engaging style:“Francis Galton, Charles Davenport, Harry Laughlin, Madison Grant, and Adolf Hitler all shared several features: All were, by their definition, Nordic; all believed that Nordics should procreate freely while non-Nordics should be prevented from procreating; and all were childless.” (p. 122)Today’s view of lobotomies includes the comical: the “Frontal Lobotomy” is a drink made with amaretto, Chambord and pineapple juice; a joke, “I’d rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy” (from Tom Waits); and a T-shirt with a picture of George W. Bush and the words, “Ask me about my lobotomy.”In regard to Rachel Carson and her imagined Eden-like world before pesticides, Offit quotes William Cronin: “It is not hard to reach the conclusion that the only way human beings can hope to live naturally on earth is to follow the hunter-gatherers back into a wilderness Eden and abandon virtually everything that civilization has given us.” (p. 186)Writing about Linus Pauling and other august scientists who couldn’t bring themselves to admit they were wrong, Offit offers: “When anybody contradicted Einstein, he thought it over, and if he found he was wrong, he was delighted, because he felt he had escaped from an error.” (p. 197-198)The essence of Offit’s argument in this book is this quote from page 212: “…all scientists—no matter how accomplished or well known—should have unassailable data to support their claims, not just a compelling personality, an impressive shelf of awards, or a poetic writing style.” --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946484-patricia,3," I liked this book in general and learned a lot from it. I have read other books by Offit, and he has outstanding credentials as a scientist, especially in the field off vaccine development, and as an author. Having said this, I will add that his treatment of Rachel Carson and DDT was too shallow, glib and biased for me.  I wish he had dug deeper and researched this section more extensively. When DDT first came out it was highly regarded, very effective at killing invertebrates, and slashed deaths due to malaria dramatically. Unfortunately, it was greatly over-used in a non-selective manner for agricultural applications worldwide, as well as for mosquito abatement and many mosquitoes in malarious regions developed resistance to DDT.  Carson’s book, Silent Spring, meticulously documents the effects of DDT applications on Clear Lake in Northern California where the multiplication effects of DDT moving up the food chain increased its concentration to a level that impeded the reproduction of waterfowl, raptors, and seagulls who fed at the top of the food pyramid and whose egg shells were malformed, and whose reproduction plummeted.  Robins and other songbird populations also declined due to the effects of eating earthworms, and insects who had been poisoned by DDT applications. DDT is stored in fatty tissues in vertebrates and continues to this day to pollute our environment worldwide. It is slow to degrade and passes from mother to child in breast milk. I hope readers will read Carson’s books before they accept Offit’s assessment of her expertise as a scientist and researcher. Linda Lear has written the definitive biography of Rachel Carson which will also educate the reader about Miss Carson’s education, and career as a scientist, editor, researcher, and environmentalist.  Rachel Carson was assaulted by the chemical industry when her book, Silent Spring, became a best seller. The controversy over her claims was hyped in the media and led to Congressional the investigations ordered by John Kennedy to get to the truth of the evidence and claims on both sides.  She was vindicated then, and she will endure in history as one of the prime movers of the birth of environmental movement. She challenged the prevailing view that nature existed primarily to serve human beings with little concern for the short or long term effects on the rest of the inhabitants of the planet.  Carson reminded us that nature and science have their own laws and must be studied and respected if we are to survive on this planet. She pointed out that pesticides and herbicides are often non selective ‘ biocides’ that do not discriminate between organisms that we deem to be beneficial or to be harmful. As we now know beyond a doubt, Carson was accurate in her assessment and warning.  Toxicology is complex and we need unbiased research to evaluate the costs and benefits of selective application of chemicals to our planet. If we do not do sufficient research before we use toxic chemicals we will suffer the consequences.  DDT is still used selectively in some malarious regions where mosquitos have not developed resistance. Carson did not advocate DDT abolition, she advocated caution and selective application for public health measures. This fact was not presented in Offit’s book. I hope my commentary will encourage readers who care about Carson’s legacy to examine the facts themselves and to draw their own conclusions.  "
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25058417-jim-fix,5,"I really can't speak highly enough about this book, written about science by a physician who writes like a fine novelist. No need for scientific knowledge to understand the profound mistakes done to all of us in the name of, but misuse of, science. Through the whole book there are only a few quick equations; you can skip those paragraphs, otherwise learn easily, and enjoy.I expected a book criticizing the atomic bomb, the CIA's use of LSD on unaware citizens, possibly Freud's promotion of cocaine, or physicians who for years blamed mothers for actually causing autism. None of these are here. Some things the author does describe, though, are how an entire field of medicine routinely inflicted frontal lobotomies on psychiatric patients--including John Kennedy's sister who was only mildly disturbed until lobotomized; and how a German scientist saved millions of lives with a chemical that allows current huge agricultural production, then turned his skills to developing methods for chemical warfare.Two chapters I might edit, however, concerned Linus Pauling and Rachel Carson (Silent Spring). I would give Pauling a pass for two reasons. First, he won two Nobel Prizes in chemistry--the only person who had done that at the time (plus a hair's width miss of a third prize with an inaccurate conception of DNA's structure). Here his contributions were highly positive. But it was widely known toward the end of his life that Linus was no longer ""quite right."" Then. the way his wife, and partner died--no spoiler here.The chapter that caused me the most pain, however, concerned one of my heroes, Rachel Carson, someone who's large display I have visited in the Smithsonian Museum. The author rightly gives her credit for some of her best-known accomplishments--helping us to see how what we do to planet earth really does affect how we survive, and making love of nature palpable and awe-inspiring. But the author fails to describe what I believe are her most important accomplishments. She added stridently to the progress of women. She showed that it was alright for women to be smart, to be loud, to have points of view, to master math, biology, chemistry. . . and to think.I loved this gently-teaching, emotionally moving book.

The stories in this book are:- How the quest for a non-addictive form of opium led to the creation of heroin and OxyContin- How a misunderstanding of saturated and unsaturated fats led to a move towards margarine and heart disease- How the invention of creating nitrogen from air helped us feed more people, but also created deadliest weapons- The story of eugenics. This was chilling but it was also strange how while he rightly called out people like Margaret Sanger for her support of eugenics and saying that it was time for “human weeds to be exterminated” the author glossed over Darwin’s influence on his half cousin Francis Galton, the father of eugenics.- The story of the lobotomy and how people thought there was an easy fix for mental illness.- How Rachel Carson rightly pointed out man’s impact on the environment, but by ignoring evidence and unfairly targeting DTT, led to its ban and as a result, many needless deaths by malaria.- How Linus Pauling, a novel prize winner, managed to fall off the intellectual cliff and recommend excessive amounts of vitamin C, sparking the vitamin craze.Every chapter of the book ends with a lesson we can learn from that particular example of science gone wrong, and the last chapter recaps it all while adding even more examples.If you’ve read Do You Believe in Magic, you should also Pandora’s Lab for more information on how we can apply lessons from the past to the issues of today.This review was first posted at Inside the mind of a Bibliophile"

It is accessible to all. Go for it. Science can be Pandora’s beautiful box. And our curiosity about what science can offer has allowed us, in some cases, to unleash evils that have caused much suffering and death.What is the book about?Pandora’s Lab: Seven Stories of Science Gone Wrong is written by Paul A. Offit – long time author and renowned doctor.Dr. Offit has identified and detailed seven instances of inventions and circumstances surrounding them, whose impact (mostly negative) is still being felt today. These seven instances cover a wide spectrum – ideas and products, time periods, geographies and walks of life. Just to be clear, these seven instances are the stories of how we, human beings, have through our biases, perceptions and poor understanding, have misused science. Science, by itself, is neither good nor bad.What does this book cover?Pandora’s Lab consists of 8 chapters with an epilogue. It is an average sized book that does not overstay its welcome.The first seven chapters cover- The Opiod crisis – the rampant misuse of painkillers- The hoopla around Cholesterol- The Haber Process for fixing nitrogen and how it is killing ecosystems across the world- Eugenics and how it lead to Hitler’s rise as well as the current racist tension across the world- Lobotomies- The hysteria around DDT which lead to the banning of one of the safest and most effective insecticides in the world- The craze for magic supplements like vitamins and mineralsThe last chapter consolidates all the learnings we have had from the mistakes committed.Read the full review at my blog Digital Amrit"

No, this is not an anti-science book - it's a cautionary tale with examples of science being misused, misinterpreted, and ignored. Sometimes the culprits have been well-intentioned but ill-informed people without any formal scientific training, but often highly-respected scientists themselves have caused the harm - even Nobel Prize winners!The book looks at 7 specific areas, such as opiates, trans-fats, and DDT. For example, the chemicals derived from poppies have long been known to alleviate pain, however they come with a huge cost of addiction. Many scientists and doctors have tried to isolate the benefits without the downsides, but the results have still been millions of addicts (and deaths) throughout the centuries. The chapter on DDT - probably my favorite - is an especially good example of how pseudoscience and politics can have disastrous consequences. I knew DDT as something that was supposedly responsible for a decline in birds of prey, but banning it has resulted in millions of human deaths from typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and diseases spread by mosquitoes and other insects. Other chapters discuss common ingredients in our food, which once seemed like good ideas but weren't (you might have eaten some of them yesterday).Paul Offitt has written a very interesting book that I found difficult to put down - and made me rethink some of my own opinions. Anyone who's wondered about nutrition or GMOs or cancer will find much to ponder in this easy read. (I rec'd an advance copy from Amazon Vine.)"

It just makes me feel better about myself, you know? Sure, I accidentally set my microwave on fire, but I didn't singlehandedly cause malaria rates to increase worldwide.〰Offit writes about scientific snafus in an engaging, almost narrative way that makes it easy for even me, a person whose college science credit was entitled Biology for Life, and I passed it because my lab partner hunted turkeys with the TA. I'm real dumb at science, is what I'm saying.〰There's a real butterfly effect feel to this book, too, as Offit makes it clear that one never knows how his/her words and actions will affect the world at large. He also points out that several of the scientists mentioned never did recant their studies or findings, always believing in their own infallibility in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.〰I listened to this as an audiobook, and I found the narrator to be kind of dry; however, the fascinating subject matter overcame that little hang up."

For example, did you know that eugenics was started in the United States by a prominent attorney, that led to mass sterilization of ""inferior"" people and was later adopted by Hitler to justify the extermination of Jews and other undesirables. Or that lobotomies were originated by a highly prominent neurosurgeon and continued for years even though the horrors of them were understood.

After all reading about science, old science at that doesn't sound particularly interesting at first. However, for anyone who has an interest in finding out how we got to here from there, this is a great read. It's more than science or chemistry, it's a commentary on human nature. You don't need a big degree to understand the writing at all and even if you read the book jacket and say, ""Oh I know all of this already."" I'm pretty sure you'll find information you didn't know.My favorite chapters were Blood from Air and The Great Margarine Mistake.

We were both completely shocked how little we were taught about certain topics in history class. Each chapter was written on a different topic - what were thought to be answers, improvements and scientific leaps forward actually took us way back or caused great damage (opening Pandora's box). The topics were: opioid epidemic, eugenics, man-made nitrogen and chemical warfare, vitamin c and too much of a good thing, DDT and environmentalism, lobotomies, transfats...This book gives thorough stories with backgrounds on those involved.

The chapter on opioids was fascinating with how desperate individuals were to sell the various derivatives as cure-alls. I am curious to delve more into what Offitt covered about DDT, especially as I remember my elementary science classes covering DDT and the thin eggshells of birds of prey, and I'm curious about how much my own confirmation biases are a factor in thoughts. The combination of humans wanting quick fixes and persuasive individuals has certainly had a lasting effect on humanity. "

The author tended to have a single person as the significant turning point in many of these events, but I suspect that in most cases there were many factors at play. It seemed the worst mistakes were a result of not testing a broad enough sample or, in some cases, not testing at all.

The writing is decent, and the book contains some interesting information.The premise of the book is told in the title. Some of the topics he covers are:* Opium * Margarine* Nitrogen and the German chemist Fritz Haber* Eugenics and Dr. Mengele* Lobotomies* DDT* Bisphenol A (BPA)* Vitamin C megadosing and Linus Pauling* E-cigarettes* GMOs* VaccinationsI had a few issues with the book, however. The first is that the author has managed to cram in a bit of Trump Derangement Syndrome™ (TDS) into a book about science, somehow... He opens the chapter on eugenics with Trump (massive eye roll) and his quote about Mexico ""Not sending their best..."" regarding (the key word here) 
illegal
 immigrants. Another lefty that can't seem to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration... Sigh. The chapter then goes back to tie Trump's strong stance on illegal immigration back to racism, then eugenics, and then (of course) Adolph Hitler. The author then concludes from this fallacious reasoning that there is no biological component to race. LMAO. Terrible...Offit also talks a bit about bisphenol A (BPA) and says that fears of it are unfounded. BPA is a known endocrine disruptor, and numerous studies have found that laboratory animals exposed to low levels of it have elevated rates of diabetes, mammary and prostate cancers, decreased sperm count, reproductive problems, early puberty, obesity, and neurological problems.There is zero downside for not using BPA, and employing the precautionary principle. Offit also seemingly lumps all vitamin and supplements together when talking about how harmful Linus Pauling's megadosing of vitamin C was. Overall, this was a somewhat interesting book, but the criticisms above took too much away from any positive aspects of it for me.2 stars."
57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844382-josh,4,"Extremely terrific science book....except the part where he does science wrong?Lemme go with the good first. It's exceptionally well-written and completely fascinating. Offit digs into a some of these voraciously, uncovering layer after layer of science history to determine where each of these science miracles went off the rails. This book kept me up past bedtime several night in a row, which is no easy task these days.Then came the DDT chapter, which felt like all the bad science he spent the first half of the book dissecting. Such as: bad sourcing, omitting important facts, stubbornly sticking to his original hypothesis in the face of clear evidence against it. Maybe what happened is that the story of DDT didn't fit cleanly into his overall narrative. Rather than a straightforward case of good science gone bad, whether or not it should ever be used is a genuine policy conundrum. It effectively kills the most deadly species on Earth--that is, by far, the mosquito--and saves countless lives. But using it *also* creates environmental problems and it never goes away, just bio-accumulating for ages. For Offit to whiff so completely on this particular issue is really weird, and tainted the overall experience of the book. I'm trusting his research on a lot of this, but should I?I don't know 100% how to resolve that point, because the rest of the book is so darn good. If not for that I'd say it's a book everyone should read. The best science and history books illuminate the past in a way to make you better understand the present, and this largely succeeds."

However, what is there is an interesting dissection of how science has been misused to sometimes horrible ends. Mostly, I found it compelling, although his use of Nixon’s War on Drugs as a legitimate symbol of the progress of the opioid crisis in the first chapter of the book made me question how much of the story was well-researched and how much was just found to be conveniently supportive. However, I am fairly familiar with a lot of the topics he covered and didn’t notice anything quite on that level again. This is not a feel good book, but there are several useful lessons in it, especially in the chapter about eugenics."

One doctor ( of medicine) told me how now all the studies of the effective procedures are disputed and proved incorrectly within the decades or even five year period. So with this book it shows how once vitamins were considered to be panacea for all the harms abut turned out to be poison. And certain poisons are quite safe in small doses (that is why I would always use my favorite very effective antiperspirant full of deadly chemicals).

64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68694930-val,4,"This is a hard book to rate. It presents 7 examples of ""science gone wrong,"" but in each of the 7 cases it wasn't science that went wrong: misguided people who ignored the science or refused to consider further evidence are what went wrong. Science itself is neither right nor wrong. What people do with it, and to what end, is where the right and wrong lies, so in every case people, not science, have gone wrong. With an already mischaracterized premise for the book, I can't rate it above 4 even though the examples in it were fascinating and well-presented.The chapter on eugenics is really well-done even though the topic is repulsive. Eugenics is a terrible use of science that has murdered countless millions, most notably under the Nazis with the horrible mutilations and experiments Dr. Josef Mengele conducted in the name of producing a ""master race."" The case studies of forced sterilization so the mentally ill or the poor or minorities would stop reproducing were appalling. I will never think of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the same way again after learning more about the inhuman and despicable decision he wrote for the Supreme Court in Buck v. Bell. The chapter on butter versus margarine and eggs versus cholesterol was terrific, with misguided scientists leading America from a natural fat to a hydrogenated one that was much worse for humans (trans fats). A lot to learn there. My mom bought that hook, line, and sinker in the 1970s, and her heart health has paid a price. The chapter on the banning of DDT was perhaps the most eye-opening and appalling. Environmentalists were concerned that DDT might be harming certain bird species, a belief not even based on scientific evidence but based on one nature-writer's delusional book about birdsong disappearing. People were swayed into fear by this one book, ignored science, and banned DDT, the world's most effective protection from mosquito-borne illnesses, particularly malaria. After the ban, malaria made a comeback with a vengeance, killing 500 million people since the ban. Now we have Zika, West Nile, a new encephalitis, and other new mosquito-borne diseases all thanks to irrational and unscientific fear of DDT. Amazing science and pseudo-science and fear-mongering about DDT by environmentalists, all in one chapter. One of the best chapters in the book.One thing that stuck out to me was the author's criticism of scientists who were too arrogant and myopic to accept that their science wasn't settled. Eggs were good for us, then bad for us, then good for us again. New methods, new research, new science - produced new findings. Same for butter and margarine (only without the back and forth). Same for DDT (wasn't lowering bird population), same for vitamin C and vitamin supplements, and GMOs, and BPA-free plastic bottles. In every case the author criticizes the scientists for thinking the science was settled and having closed minds to other interpretations of evidence or other causes for what they were seeing in their own research. Throughout, the author chides us for following fear instead of science. Yet, throughout the book, the one science the author repeatedly states is settled, is climate science. Apparently that is the one field in science where there in no possibility that today's groupthink among scientists could be proven wrong, or that climate change might be due to natural factors much more capable of influence than mankind, such as continuing changes in solar activity (see Forbes magazine for an article about this new finding by a renowned Israeli scientist with a resume that would put most climate scientists to shame). I'm not saying the current climate science is wrong or right, rather, I am saying no science is permanently ""settled"" if scientists keep their minds open to new evidence over time. The author doesn't seem to think that's important, at least not with climate science. There may be as much groupthink and fear going on with Gore's book on global warming as there was with Carson's book about birds dying off. Movies about cities underwater from rising oceans, apocalyptic Hollywood blockbusters about superstorms ravaging the earth and freezing NYC. One current presidential candidate just said yesterday that climate change is a greater threat to us than ISIS. This is exactly the kind of panic-induced fear overruling science that the author says was so horrible about Rachel Carson's book, but he doesn't recognize even the possibility of it in today's climate science fear campaign. The birds weren't dying off in Carson's time. They were increasing, but she relied on someone's erroneous observations about birds as the premise for scaring the world into banning DDT, which led to hundreds of millions of dead humans by disease. As the author points out in the DDT chapter, environmentalists don't give any priority to humans, as they consider humans just another organism in a complex ecosystem. Since they don't have humanity's best interest in mind, why do we prioritize what they cry should be banned as harmful to the environment? What are we banning today out of climate fear because anyone with new or different interpretations of climate data are mob-shamed for not believing the science is settled? I came away from that DDT chapter convinced the author is just as closed-minded about climate science as any of the people he criticized in this book for ignoring other points of view that might have saved the world a lot of suffering, pain, and death. Science is all about open-mindedness, but heaven help a scientist today who dares say maybe 97% of today's climate scientists could be just as wrong about climate change as scientists were about butter and margarine. They also could be right about climate change, but to say the science is settled is just an effort to stifle rigorous debate and challenges to the scientific method.In another chapter the author claims the science is settled that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier than standard cigarettes, primarily because e-cigarettes do not contain tar. He makes is sound like e-cigarettes are a healthy way to get a nicotine fix, conveniently leaving out that the vapor contains numerous carcinogenic chemicals and compounds that more open-minded scientists are discovering cause lung damage. In addition, the nicotine levels in e-cigarettes marketed to teens and kids are higher than the levels in standard tobacco cigarettes, meaning that these cancer-causing agents are being delivered in clever fruity high-tech gadgets straight into the lungs and throats of children and teens who are still physically developing, AND they are more likely to become addicted to nicotine than kids were 20 years ago smoking tobacco cigarettes. One wonders why the author is so quick to buy into the ""healthier"" claims about e-cigarettes, considering that the exact same big-tobacco criminals who lied to the world about the addictive nature and physical harm of tobacco cigarettes are producing and marketing and enriching themselves on ""harmless"" e-cigarettes. That anyone would accept claims from tobacco companies as fact before a decade or two of real scientific research challenges those claims is the ultimate naïveté. The other products the author discusses in that chapter and the chapters preceding and following it are enlightening and valuable, but he missed the mark badly by not digging deeper into studies showing negative health effects from e-cigarettes. If you like to be intellectually stimulated (to agreement or not), this might be a good read for you. There are some great lessons in it about how science has been used or misused, or ignored, at great cost to us all."

This book is based on the premise that even the best and scientifically sound ideas or intentions of the time can lead to horrible unintended consequences- chapter one: opium--> opiates and the wake of addiction. originally thought to be a beneficial drug-chapter two: margarine and the untruth of fats being what caused heart disease. In contrast the push forward of foods with trans fat has been horribly detrimental to our health. "" From NEJM ""on a per calorie basis, trans fat appear to increase the risk of coronary heart disease more than any other macronutrient""chapter three: the ability to fix nitrogen --> it helped feed the world's population, but the excess nitrogen or nitrogen polution has destroyed ecosystems. Famines are much more rare due to access to fertilizers from the ability to fix nitrogen .. but the world now has an obesity problem. As if that wasn't enough the same guy developed chemical warfare weapons for germany and one of the products he helped manufacture was used to kill millions of jews, and he was a jew himself. In such he saved millions and certainly killed millions. chapter four: America's master race: eugenics, forced sterilization, racismChapter five: lobotomies: the lesson is to always be aware of the quick fixchapter six: mosquito liberation front : this was a surprising chapter to me. I learned Rachel Carson was an effective writer but often not everything was based on good facts. Her works led to the banning of DDT despite the claims of harm being dubious. As a consequence many unnecessarily died of malaria and mosquito born illness. Chapter seven: Noble prize disease: Linus Pauling was smart but he had one false belief that he held on to tightly that vitamins were a miracle cure. when the scientific studies never worked out he decided that the studies were just wrong.

If you know anything about these very common popular science topics there are better books on each of them out there!This book focuses on when science was used for ill. Honestly, it just didn't seem that carefully researched. To me blog posts and speculation are not enough ""proof"". I kept reading assertions that contradicted other scientific writing I have read on the topics and then when I looked up the references (which are not directly correlated to facts presented so you can't fact check warning) the references were often other popular science writing rather than primary sources. I really thought it would be, well, more scientific. At least I expected the arguments to be presented scientifically. A lot the science that is included is super basic, often focused on definitions of things rather than what is necessary to understand the point, often explained in a really dumbed down way which really put me off.Each chapter was formulaic. There was a problem, followed by a solution from someone with a little experience, followed by consequences when they weren't on the right path. My biggest issue with this book is it is so unnuanced. These examples and this topic is really important! How people read and report on scientific results is really important! Not following food and medicine trends before rigorous studies is really important! However, in my view this book doesn't tackle any of these important issues. Instead it presents a very surface level view of bad scientist and science and science reporting without providing a balanced view of the good science can do or alternatively providing effective actions to take to prevent these kind of events rather than just platitudes.

Pandora's Lab is a vindication of the principle that science and scientists can do just as much harm as good.While this is an especially important lesson for young scientists to learn, it's something we all need to be aware of - especially in the age of the internet, when information is everywhere but evidence is sometimes lacking. Luckily, you don't have to be a scientist to understand and learn from Pandora's Lab. Written in clear prose that avoids being unnecessarily pedantic, with chapters that strike a balance between detail and conciseness, the book manages to be packed with information without reading like a textbook. The first seven chapters contain a mix of scientific information and historical context and follow important personages, so that they read more like stories than dry recitations of facts. And while the history of these discoveries and their impact on our world - both historically and today - is fascinating, Offit is careful to point out that pseudoscience, misinformation and misunderstanding, and overreaction aren't confined to the past. Linking the mistakes that led to the disasters reported in the first seven chapters to the scientific discoveries and inquiries of today, the last chapter of Pandora's Lab serves as a guide for how we can prevent such disasters in the future. Meticulous, thoroughly researched, and thoughtfully written, this is a book that science and history enthusiasts will enjoy reading and learning from. But it's also a book with a very important lesson that everyone needs to hear - not just scientists, but the public who is their audience and whose lives are altered by the implementation of their findings. It's very rare that I come across a book that I truly believe should be required reading, but this is one of them, and it comes with my highest recommendation.Verity Reviews"

That seems unbelievable today. Offit shows how science has been used to hurt people. One of the fascinating stories is about the DDT controversy. I read the book, Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in high school. Silent Spring is a damning indictment of DDT, and that book led not only to the birth of environmental movement which is a good thing, but also the banning of DDT which has now been shown to be a bad thing. DDT saved millions of lives due to its control of the malarial mosquito. So we traded propaganda hysteria for lives. Silent Spring was a long time best seller, and is considered a classic, but Offit shows that many of Carson's points have been thoroughly debunked. Another fascinating story is how South Korea began doing routine thyroid ultrasounds where they detected numerous thyroid masses. Surgical resections followed, which led to many surgical complications. And when they looked at the data, the death rate before and after the program to ultrasound thyroid glands was exactly the same. I am not sure about this but Offit makes the same point about mammography and prostate PSA testing. Many, many tests are done and many ""cancers"" are found, but the death rate for breast cancer and prostate have not changed. Early detection may not do anything. We cannot yet distinguish between fast moving malignancies and ones that never amount to anything. There is a feeling in the public that all new procedures and treatments are better. Maybe they are, but many times they are not and that can lead to complications and obviously greater expense. Never trust medicine with its new toys and drugs. Wait until the data is in seems to be Offit's point. This book is an extremely fast and enjoyable read."

70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2996052-elizabeth,5,"This was a fascinating read. Written by a physician, this is an amazing mix of science, history and how humans can be amazingly brilliant and generous yet have such capacity for pride, blind ambition and hate. I was shocked so many times reading this book. The chapter on eugenics and how the Eugenics Research Office had ""an adivsory board that read like a who's who of academic royalty""as well as receiving funding from the Carnegies, Rockefellers, Eastmans, as well as the US government was stomach-turning. And reading that Hitler began forming thoughts on Jews and eugenics while reading an American-written book all about ""making America great again"" while he was in prison at the age of 36, gave me chills. Hitler even sent a fan letter to the author saying ""This book is my Bible"". I saw many correlations to messages heard today regarding immigrants, the poor, and the disabled.So, I can't recommend this book enough. The main seven lessons learned are:1) It's all about the data2) Everything has a price; the only question is how big3) Beware the zeitgeist4) Beware the quick fix5) The dose makes the poison6) Be cautious about being cautious7) Pay attention to the little man behind the curtainIf you enjoy having ""Woah, I never knew that..."" moments with history or science then check it out.

Well, it turns out all of those tasty trans fats were significantly more lethal than saturated fats ever were, and were devastating to our heart health. (And still are, they haven't been completely removed from our food supply.)This book explores seven such stories of science (opioids, trans fats, nitrogen fertilizers, eugenics, lobotomies, DDT, and megavitamins) where the intentions of the scientists didn't start out nefarious (eugenics being the exception) but through various missteps and stubbornness, the end results were catastrophic to health, culture, and environment. It also discusses a lot of the common misperceptions the public has about certain things. For example, DDT; it wasn't nearly the bird killing, poisonous scourge it was made out to be, and when used responsibly it was arguably more effective and safer for the environment than the chemicals eventually replacing it.In the epilogue, Offit applies the lessons of hubris, data collection, peer review, and the importance of reproducible results to other modern inventions (ex: BPA, e-cigarettes). Time will tell if we will learn from the past, but it seems likely we'll be doomed to repeat it. "

73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17722050-bookish-dervish,5,"The history of science, like the history of all human ideas, is a history of irresponsible dreams, of obstinacy, and of error. But science is one of the very few human activities — perhaps the only one — in which errors are systematically criticized and fairly often, in time, corrected.Karl R. Popper,Science has revolutionised our lives as a species, but... It has some shortcomings that need to be reduced to vertually zero, polution, weapons of mass-distraction, eugenics... are clear examples.This book examines this issue refering to the myth of pandora's box which, when opened, brings about all sorts of distruction.Paul offit goes through the history of sciences and tells the story of seven scientific experiments which had gone comletely wrong. He starts with1- opium and opioids2- margarine3- nitrogen fertilizers4- eugenics5- lobotomies6-DDT7- he over-consumption of Vitamin C to cure cancer.The book starts really well, but declines towards the last two chapters. Discussing the benefits of moderate use of DDT to keep mosquitoes, and hence, malaria at bay.All in all, pandora's lab is a good read. Highly recommended."

I greatly enjoyed the rest of the book while attempting to bypass the political bile. Dr. Offit seems indifferent to the fact that 50% of his potential readers voted for Mr. Trump and subsequently really don't care to see our current president (now only eight months in office) badly maligned in print when such should have been avoided -- when writing about his strange connection between eugenics and immigration, he went out-of-the-way to include negative comments (including ridiculous comparisons of the president with the German WWII Nazis and ""Angel of Death"" Dr. Mengele) . I nearly did not read the rest of the book after coming upon some brief negativity of this nature in the opening pages."
75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2176491-cheryl,5,"This is a fascinating book for anyone who is even remotely interested in science. You don’t need to be a science major to understand it and the book is a quick read. Each chapter is devoted to a different scientific advancement that did not turn out exactly as planned. The book's Chapters are: “God’s Own Medicine” (the opium poppy and modern pain drugs)“The Great Margarine Mistake” (transfats)“Blood from Air (The Haber Process, nitrogen fertilizer and chemical warfare) “America’s Master Race” (the Eugenics Movement),“Turning the Mind Inside Out” (mental illness and lobotomies ) “Mosquito Liberation Front” (DDT and Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. There is a LOT I never learned in school)“The Nobel Prize Disease” (Linus Pauling and others.) The author, Paul A Offit, MD is Professor of Vaccinology and Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, and is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Very informative read."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72561929-randall-russell,5,"I found this book to be quite interesting. The stories that the author used to show how science went bad were very illustrative. For example, the first example he gives is of opioids, and how morphine was supposed to be safer than opium, heroin was supposed to be safer than morphine, and oxycodone was supposed to be safer than morphine. Of course, that assertion of safety turned out to be based on highly flawed data, and tens of thousands of deaths later, we're still trying to learn that lesson. In addition, it appears that based on a number of recent studies, it may be questionable exactly how effective opioids are in dealing with pain. I strongly identified with the author's viewpoint, as the other day I saw an online article titled something like ""A Safer Version of Opioids,"" and I had to chuckle (in a sad sort of way) at the irony. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants some insight into the potential downside to some of our major scientific advances. "
77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27018751-jennifer,4,"Very interesting treating of several scandals in the scientific and medical communities however lots of opinions as well. The book was pretty balanced until the very end--comparing Dr. Andrew Wakefield to Linus Pauling's debacle with his Vitamin C mess. While we know Dr. Offit is loud in the vaccine circles, this last jab was a little funny for those of us who have heard the words of Dr. William Thompson and the CBS report into Dr. Offit's fundings--which he wouldn't even grant an interview or rebuttal. Fear perhaps--like a child with his hand caught in the cookie jar? With that said--take his opinions and hypotheses with a grain of salt. Science constantly changes as we find out more. Hence my rating of 4/5 stars. "
78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,4,"This is an entertaining book about some false scientific theories that gained a lot of popular appeal and how that happened. Some of theories simply carried a hypothesis to such extremes that the ""cure"" as worse than the ""disease."" In other cases a totally false narrative promoted by someone famous is believed by enough people that bad policies are adopted. In most cases there are individuals and companies who profit from the bad policy and can keep the idea alive long past when it should be dismissed. Remember just because someone is railing against ""big pharma"" doesn't mean that he is not making big bucks by selling his alternative. Following the 7 stories is chapter 8 which is a good summary of how to assess evidence and get to the truth. "
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6321512-kolumbina,2,"I started to read this book with a lot of enthusiasm. Really liked the first three chapters about opium, fats and Fritz Haber. I knew (read before) most of the things (scientific facts) P.A. Offit is talkingabout in this book, still found it very interesting, a few new information, didn't know the origins of F. Haber ...But, I didn't like the chapter on DDT and Rachel Carson at all. Neither the following chapter about Linus Pauling. So much criticism, building knowledge or science on someone's mistakes (at their time), even involving Watson and Crick.. Don't like the books based entirely on other people's mistakes. I accept that we all learn on someone else's mistakes but in Pandora's Lab P.A. Offit is going on and on...., even in the chapter on conclusions. Really disappointed."
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316801-dan-dolan,2,"This is an easy read but pales in comparison to an earlier book with a similar title (Prometheans in the Lab, S.B. McGrayne). Chapters 1-2 covering opioids and margarine, are probably the best; Chapter 7 discusses how very smart individuals can really go off the rails later in their career. Chapter 6, which could be titled ""DDT ain't so bad"", is poorly researched. Some of the references are little more than blog posts and websites, not peer-review journals. The indiscriminate use of this pesticide would rapidly lead to resistant mosquitoes, undercutting the argument about how many lives could have been saved if not for bans on its use."
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8608191-matthew-bolin,5,"An excellent book that goes over a number of scientific events, inventions and opinions that turned out to be not just wrong, but harmful in the long run. The lessons to be learned in each example chapter are brought back in the book's final chapter to apply to problematic science that exists at least on the periphery of the mainstream today (vaccines & mercury; the actual benefits of cancer diagnostic tests; GMOs and BPAs, etc.). Lessons applicable in the past that have direct correlation to events of today are also examined, giving life (and new worry) to events that have happened but may similarly happen again (e.g. eugenics & the racial components of Trumpism)."

This is a book that every American needs to read in order to dissect the science from the fiction and sensationalization that can occur via mainstream news reporting. I trust and respect the author as a dedicated physician with an excellent understanding of scientific principles. His arguments are so well-written that I can't help but say that yes, hindsight truly is 20-20. He steers clear of vague generalizations and states the studies and the facts. As someone in science and medicine, I appreciate the quality and honesty of his writing. I'm excited to read what he writes next. "

I would recommend it to everyone, regardless of your interest in science and chemistry. It is written so that anyone could understand. The author picks 7 scientific and medical discoveries that have turned out to be harmful or bogus. It is fact filled and convincing in its arguments. Any time I can read something and come away educated, I know my time is not wasted. This book was definitely not a waste of time."

I love this quote from the last chapter: ""The trouble with the world is not that people know too little, it's that they know so many things that ain't so."" - Mark Twain. A few of the myths Mr. Offit cited, I actually thought were true. Dr. Offit's underlying salient point is that man often falls into traps by not always validating the popular premise with hard data. We listen to the Wizard of Oz instead of being Toto and pulling the curtain back. That tenacious little dog figured it out and Offit wants us to as well. Everyone should read this!"
