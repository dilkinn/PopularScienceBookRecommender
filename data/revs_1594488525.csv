0,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"I would have liked this to have been a much better book. There were parts of it where it showed promise – but those parts were swamped in what was mostly ‘junk polymathism’. That is a new phrase I’ve made up – I think it might even prove handy. I am going to use it as a way to describe someone who has decided to refer to multiple disciplines, but not really use them in a way that shines new light on either the topic at hand or on the discipline referred to. Worst of all was the fact that when he referred to some subjects (Kuhn and Hegel in particular) his knowledge of the topics was so superficial that it was hard not to wonder why he bothered explaining them, when he might have seemed more intelligent if he had just kept to the topic at hand. I mean, why bother to give a description of Hegelian Dialectics if all you are going to say is ‘thesis, antithesis, synthesis’?There were bits of this book that I quite liked, despite them being hidden under a mountain of junk. And those were the bits where he discusses how Priestley came to find out (if not actually ‘discover’) oxygen. This book really could have done with a good editor. I think that unless you are a particularly good story teller – and this guy just isn’t – I think the best policy is to tell the story in chronological order. In fact, this is good advice even if you are a great writer. Life has a way of ordering things sequentially that makes sense. If you are going to mess around with that, it is probably best that you have a very good reason. Not that he played around with time too much, but I would bet this guy can’t tell a good joke. I would bet he gives the punchline away before he is half way through.The point is that there were bits of this I really liked. Here is a guy who leaves England because he is too radical to remain there and is welcomed to the newly formed United States as the friend of two early Presidents and also Benjamin Franklin. This is an Age of Enlightenment hero – the guy who discovered Oxygen, no less – and yet. And yet…Bad writing really does get in the way of even the best of stories and I felt some of his ‘asides’ to discuss paradigm shifts, ecosystems and such stuff were so cursory as to take away from the book, rather than add to it. He discusses the ‘great man of history’ idea and comes to something like the same conclusion as Gladwell in Outliers, if not as extreme a version as Gladwell (and extremely right, I think). But this is uninspired and uninspiring. Yes, I can see why it was put into the book, one would need to explain why Priestley made quite so many momentous discoveries – but what we are left with here is so bland and so opinionated that it adds nothing to the book.Right, the good bits.The best of this was the discussion of how he worked out how ‘bad air’ became ‘good air’ again. I have often wondered how they worked out that plants had something to do with putting oxygen back into air. It is a bit like how they worked out that plants feed on sun-light – you do have to wonder how anyone would think to test such an idea.Priestley was exactly the sort of guy who would come up with an experiment to test that sort of thing. If you were to make up a story as a just so story called How Some Guy in a Powdered Wig Discovered the Secret of Breathing – you might think he had already guessed that plants somehow made oxygen and so tried to think up experiments to prove just that. That is not what happened. If PETA had been around in the 18th century there is little doubt that they would have been picketing Priestley’s house. Just before he left England his house was burnt to the ground – the standard version is that this was due to conservatives in England who objected to his rationalist, republican views. I wouldn’t be surprised if one day a letter turns up proving it was an organisation called ‘people for the ethical treatment of mice’ that did the deed. But a man can only torture so many mice to death before his attention turns to killing other of God’s creatures. I ought to do this in order. Priestly worked out that if you put a mouse in a glass container and put this container upside down in some water so that air could not get in, the glass of the glass container made a wonderful means to let you watch the mouse slowly expire. You may not think this is very entertaining, but you do have to remember they didn’t have television at the time. Anyway, he had lots of data on how long it took your average mouse to die when left in the chamber with very little air. So, he started killing off other creatures and measuring how long they would take to die.Then he had a brilliant idea. Since there was no challenge in killing animals anymore – now he wanted to see how long it would take to kill plants. So, he rushed out to the garden and got himself some mint. He popped this into the machine and much to his disappointment the mint seemed to go on living, even in the worst of air, air already breathed up by an ex-mouse. After a week or so he decided to pop a mouse back into the glass and was surprised to find that it didn’t die straight away (as it ought to have given there should have been no oxygen left in there). Somehow the plant had replaced all of the oxygen in the container.Not that it was called oxygen at the time, of course. Later when he was able to do experiments that produced oxygen he found that ‘god’s air’, the stuff that is all around us, could actually be improved on – something that must have challenged his religious sensibilities. Not only could oxygen enriched air keep the mouse alive for longer, but it made candles burn for longer too. This was actually the source of his error about oxygen, which he confused with the mythical fluid substance that allowed things to burn - phlogiston. He was nearly right, but others around him were more so.Like I said, this could and should have been a much better book and would have been if he was more interested in telling the story of the life of Priestley, rather than the author showing himself off as a bit of a polymath. "
1,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"Steven Johnson, author of the excellent ""The Ghost Map"", here takes on the life of Joseph Priestley. The best parts of this book are where he confines himself to the task at hand, and gives us details of that life. Priestley was a fascinating character, a brilliant chemist and one of the most influential scientists of his age. He was also a practicing clergyman, whose nonconformist views ultimately provoked such a storm in England that he had to flee to America with his family. He was friends with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams; as a consequence of these friendships, he was to have substantial influence on the development of political thought in the fledgling democracy. Priestley wasn't brilliant all the time, of course - there was his notorious attachment to the phlogiston theory, as well as an unhealthy obsession with the Book of Revelation in the final years of his life. So the details of Priestley's life certainly provide more than adequate material for an interesting account.Indeed, the book is at its most interesting when Johnson confines himself to filling in the biographical record. In particular, his account of the early work (discovery of what would later be termed Coulomb’s Law, publication of the ‘History of Electricity’, invention of soda water) and the two experiments which established Priestley's reputation (the work showing that plants synthesize oxygen, his later ‘discovery’ of oxygen) is excellent. Unfortunately, Johnson then seems to lose his moorings a bit. Understandably, he wants to put Priestley’s scientific contributions in historical perspective. But this leads him to include what can only be called bloviation – ponderous, pseudo-profound musings about paradigm shifts, regrettable metaphors about the nature of scientific progress down the ages, and sentences like these: In the next decade, the three paths would combine to form a mighty highway, one that would ultimately drive Priestley all the way to the New World.Seeing human history as a series of intensifying energy flows is one way around the classic opposition between the Great Men and Collectivist visions of history.What is the internal chemistry of a mob? Tellingly, mob behavior inevitably gravitates toward displays of intense energy transfer: the collective strength of a hundred enraged men pulling a building apart and unleashing the destructive, oxidizing force of combustion. Where are the editors when you need them? Seriously, dude, ease off on the goddamned chemistry metaphors, wouldja? They make you seem like a moron, which you’re not.For a prolonged stretch in its middle third, the book ceases to be mainly about Priestley, degenerating instead into a kind of “look at me, I’m Steven Johnson, see how clever I am” morass. This is unfortunate, because even the most pedestrian of Priestley’s biographical details would be more interesting than Johnson’s views on the nature of scientific progress, which seemed to me to be short on content, long on pomposity. (This actually surprised me, because I’ve heard him interviewed on the radio and he seemed quite sensible and unpretentious).Fortunately, things get back on track (more or less) for the remaining third of the book, describing the rising tide of violence that forced the Priestleys to flee to America and the scientist’s final years in Pennsylvania.Despite the misgivings expressed above, I really enjoyed this book, and have no hesitation in recommending it. But I do hope that Steven Johnson gets himself a better editor on his next project. (I've put this on my ""terrific"" shelf for now, despite reservations about Johnson's style, because Priestley's life was genuinely fascinating) "
2,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,3,"This short book is partly a biography of Joseph Priestley, a prolific and divisive 18th century figure who made influential discoveries in science (including discovering that plants replace carbon dioxide with oxygen, though he didn’t put it in quite those terms), helped found the Unitarian church, and was a bit of a political firebrand. Priestley’s life and work are interesting subjects, and with his eternal optimism, chaotic experimental procedures and determination to keep nothing – whether scientific discovery or radical religious opinion – to himself, he’s certainly a colorful figure. But this book is less impressive: there’s a little biography, a little science, a little religion, a little history, and it doesn’t add up to more than the sum of its parts. The author has a tendency to pontificate on subjects that seemed much more profound to him than they were to me, like connections between the location of coal deposits and Priestley’s life’s trajectory. But with generous margins and spacing, it’s a quick read, and I learned a bit from it even though I didn’t love it."
3,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Johnson is an interesting author. On the surface, he's straight-up science history, but he often takes extended detours into the philosophy of science and politics. Some people might find this unexpected, but I really like it because the questions that he grapples with are ones that I've also thought long and hard about, and his approach to thinking about these issues are so closely aligned with my own.The book explores some very interesting topics, not least of which is in his ""intermezzo"" chapter about the Carboniferous Period and the reason for the spike and then stabilization of atmospheric oxygen. He goes well beyond the basic story you can read about elsewhere - that plant life exploded about 300 years ago and spit tons of oxygen into the atmosphere - everyone knows that - but he explains why it happens and why then.The ending chapter also really strong. It's about Priestley's relationship with John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and it's really interesting. He does a really good job explaining how Priestley's science and politics went hand-in-hand. He also has an interesting Kuhnian spin throughout. Johnson's philosophical approach really works in this one much better than in The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World because it's that much more consistant. You also find in this book many of the seeds of the ideas he talks about in Where Good Ideas Come from: The Natural History of Innovation. This book can be taken as a sort of case-study of that book, as well as Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.I highly recommend this one if you not only like science and history but like to think deeply about the ideas behind those."
4,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055665-jack-cheng,0,"Johnson has good ideas but I don't find him the most fluid author. He's got a great subject in Joseph Priestly, who helped determine the existence of oxygen and the fact that plants create an atmosphere that can sustain a flame (or the life of a mouse). Priestly was also a radical Unitarian minister who wrote treatises outlining all the magical accretions that he thought undermined a purer Christian faith, and was a bit too enthusiastic about the French Revolution (this last part got him driven out of England by a mob, and the crown). Friends with Franklin, Adams and Jefferson, creator of carbonated water -- quite a resume. Johnson does not write a strict biography, but rather uses Priestly as a case study of how ideas and revolutions in science happen, what are the necessary frameworks and the character of inventors. The writing feels padded out, though, with lots of ""... and that would lead to a greater crisis, as we shall soon see..."" as well as some goofy ""meditations"" on how oxygen (which Priestly is credited with discovering) was produced by plants, which then became coal, and drove the industrial revolution in England, and gave Priestly the leisure time and the rich friends to support his research! Wow! It's like oxygen discovered itself! But guess what? That was a whole chapter, instead of a footnote!There are 100 great pages in here, but other parts of it feels like it was written as a term paper."
5,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1890091-randy,5,"Joseph Priestly did not 'invent' air. Rather, he was instrumental in discovering it. Let alone Joseph's influence on America as a newly born country's political, scientific and faith culture. Regardless, I find this book very well written, and a personal epiphony discovering my family is related to him. Steve Johnson's writing style is easy to read, entertaining and informing. "

7,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,5,"A lovely review of the life of a (relatively) obscure scientist/philosopher, and the times when science, politics, and religion were much more intercommunicative spheres than they are now. IOW, this guy invented soda water, founded Unitarianism, and corresponded with Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson. Plus interesting digressions into the geohistory of coal!Johnson makes a fascinating argument for an ecosystem metaphor of human history & civilization throughout, as well, and I think it serves in moving through the different scales of change addressed in the book. At what point is history influenced by individual quirks, broad social movements, accidents of geology, etc., etc., and this allows for all those levels to be in operation at once.Plus the thing that I find I like about all of Johnson's work is his (innate?) sense of optimism. Something of the Enlightenment spirit seems to motivate him, and perhaps a belief in the better angels of our nature. (I saw him at SXSWi '09 and was struck by his optimism in an area where most others are pretty damn gloomy.) In any case, for me it makes his writing a genuine pleasure to read. This book was no exception."
8,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"This book is ostensibly a biography of Joseph Priestley, one of the central figures in the eighteenth century movement known as the Enlightenment, which included fundamental changes in science, politics, and religion. And Priestly was involved in all aspects of those changes. It is a fascinating, well-written book, a short quick read. I like Johnson's style, but not everyone does. He frequently strays from the strict subject of Priestley's life to discuss more general topics like the need for intellectual networks such as those enjoyed by Priestley in today's world, and comparing the coffeehouse scholarly gatherings of the 1780s to the internet of today. I enjoy those digressions. My one complaint about the book is that it seemed a little light on the actual details of Priestley's life. But on the whole I enjoyed and would strongly recommend this book. "
9,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2752130-dauphne,2,"""The classic case study for the concept of a paradigm shift is the Compernican revolution in astronomy, but in actual fact, the first extended story that Kuhn tells in 'The Structure of Scientific Revoutions' is the paradigm shift in chemistry that took place in the 1770s, led by the revolutionary science of Joseph Priestly.""Are you freaking kidding me? Who read that sentence and remembered what the first half of it was by the time they got to the end?"
10,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"The Invention of Air has a catchy title, but its subtitle better describes the book itself: A story of Science, Faith, Revolution, and the Birth of America. Steven Johnson uses Joseph Priestley as a touchstone for a much larger argument about the relationship among science, religion, and politics and the effects this had on the Enlightenment and the American Revolution. Priestley's role in isolating oxygen and his interactions with Antoine Lavoisier make an appearance in the early half of the book. For the most part, however, this book is not so much a biography of Joseph Priestley as it is an attempt to combat the anti-intellectualism, anti-science atmosphere now insinuating itself into American society, and particularly American politics. As he confesses in his Author's Note, which precedes the book itself, Johnson is concerned by the way we view science as something relegated to a domain of professionals rather than intrinsic to humanity, saying:If there is an overarching moral to this story, it is that vital fields of intellectual achievement cannot be cordoned off from one another and relegated to the specialists, that politics can and should be usefully informed by the insights of science.I can get behind this theme. Canada, like the United States, is struggling with the role of science in informing politics and political decisions, albeit in not quite the same rhetorical, polarized fashion happening south of our border. I am quite aware that, despite their hyperbole, the Tea Party does not speak for the majority of Americans, and that most Americans are sensible people with a varying degree of respect for the sciences. I am lucky enough to have met American friends on Goodreads and elsewhere online who fall into this category. I cringe, though, when I read newspaper articles and blog posts written by people who view science as a threat to their religion or, more basically, their way of life. I feel sorry for those people, and I kind of worry about America's future. So if Johnson wants to fight this by writing a book (which strikes me as an oddly intellectual way to fight anti-intellectualism, but whatever), more power to him.Johnson's thesis also agrees with sentiments I've developed over the past few years, sentiments particularly influenced by a Philosophy of Science course. He draws upon Thomas Kuhn, of course, and discusses Priestley's discoveries in hindsight as a type of paradigm shift. In particular, as a writer he has to praise Priestley's choice to tell the story of the discovery of electricity, to be the first person to tell science through the lens of narrative rather than as a logical discourse. I have to agree; both forms have their uses, but I particularly like reading books like The Invention of Air because they are exciting and entertaining as well as educational. I'm fascinated by the history of science, as well as its philosophy. I like learning about the circumstances and coincidences that surround discoveries—for example, Priestley began investigating air because he temporarily lived behind a brewery and noticed that their vats emitted ""fixed air"" (carbon dioxide). From here, Johnson launches into a description of how, through trial and error more than any real hypothesis, Priestley manages to deduce that there is a component of air essential to respiration, that plants somehow produce or replenish it, and that it is combustible. (Unfortunately, Priestley would continue to subscribe to the theory of phlogiston until his death, even though it was discredited long before he died.)I don't want to let my enthusiasm for Johnson's aims colour my evaluation of the book too much. As much as I like what Johnson tries to do, the result feels haphazard. The book begins with Priestley's voyage on the Samson to the United States; then it hops back to the young Joseph Priestley joining the Honest Whigs in London and works its way forward roughly chronologically to where the book begins. This should have worked fine, but Johnson spends far too much time talking about what we are about to learn. Every time the name Benjamin Frankling or Thomas Jefferson came out, Johnson could not help but remind us about Priestley's influence on these men. I get it, but could we please get on with Priestley's experiments in his lab?I also wish we could have learned more about Priestley's life in general, particularly his relationship with Antoine Lavoisier. Johnson mentions, in passing, how Priestley met Lavoisier and influenced him, how Priestley found an improved formula for gunpowder and accidentally shared it with a French spy, who in turn shared it with the head of France's gunpowder committee—yes, Lavoisier. (Sometimes life is a lot better than fiction, eh?) Johnson mentions a lot, in passing, but it's frustrating because most of what we learn is bereft of details. He only occasionally deigns to go deeper into the story, as was the case with Priestley's isolation of oxygen, preferring mostly to skim along the surface. This is a short book, and it feels like a short book.Mostly well-written but sometimes extremely frustrating, The Invention of Air discusses science and religion in the context of the founding of the United States, and it does so in a genuinely interesting way. Johnson is on the right track with a lot of his arguments and with the perspective he brings to subjects like the Founding Fathers; this book is quite original, just very brief. Joseph Priestley sounds like a fascinating fellow. I just wish I had learned more about him.

12,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2196296-lora-innes,3,"This book isn't about the Revolutionary War, but instead the Revolutionary Era. It follows the story of minister/scientist/politician Joseph Priestly, who was a British Citizen and only came to American after the Revolution was over, to escape mobs who had destroyed his home and were coming after his family. Johnson does a good job of showing how these areas (faith, science, politics) are interconnected, despite the modern attempt to isolate them from one another. He shows us that they were essentially connected in the minds of 18th Century inhabitants, and that one cannot claim to follow the ideologies of the Founders without accepting this relationship.I went into the book fearing that it was going to read as a rant on modern politics but found it remarkably evenhanded. In any event, it was a fresh take on that generation and those times. If you're interested in Franklin, Adams or Jefferson, it's a great read on understanding the interesting life of this friend who deeply influenced them all."

His controversial viewpoints caused him to flee Europe and to eventually settle in central Pennsylvania--at a time when the American colonies were seeking their independence from Great Britain. Historically enlightening, and at times theologically and scientifically complex, this book reveals the thoughts of one of the greatest thinkers of his day. "
15,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,4,"As a non-academic, this book was at times a bit dense on the intersections of the history of natural philosphy, politics, and religion at the dawn of the United States' creation, but presented such an interesting picture of Joseph Priestley that I found myself being swept along with the historic events.Joseph Priestley is the real focus of the book-- not only the experiments with glass domes and mint where a real concept of the gasses making up ""air"" started to be divined, but also his mistaken obsession with how air combustion (phlogiston), his peculiar openess and willingness to share experiments and results-- even with French rival Lavoisier-- his Unitarian religious leanings that lead to various political issues, and lastly, his relationship with American intellectual luminaries Benjamin Rush, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin.The author paints a picture of a man who influences the political and scientific landscape so greatly (but is also a product of them) because he was so singular:""Here was a man at the very front lines of scientific achievement who was simultaneously a practicing minister and theologian-- and who was by the end of the 1770s, well on his way to becoming one of the most politically charged figures of his time. He was an empiricist driven by a deep and abiding belief in God, who was simultaneously a revolutionary of the first order. ""Reading it in the midst of the 2016 presidential primaries, with deeply religious Republican candidates, global warming controversies sparking ""scientific"" debate, as well as political unrest in many parts of the world, one can't help but be fascinated by a man who could be so unabashedly consumed by science at the same time as holding illogical worldviews-- kind of like some of the political figures today.A worthwhile read for American history buffs as well as a look at the life of how an intellectually rigorous and theological scientist can hold contradictory ideas."
16,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/712715-dan,5,"From my readings in the history of science and of religious controversy I was familiar with Priestley's significance before reading this book, but Johnson succeeds marvelously in delineating Priestley's importance to not just his own historical era, but in the grander scheme of intellectual and cultural history leading up to our present. Johnson's best chapters are the most sweeping, such as the discussion in the Intermezzo of the interrelatedness of the Carboniferous Age, Priestley's residence in the north of England, and his chemical experiments leading to his famous discoveries (and incidental inventions -- soda water!).Johnson's prose is very easy-going, which I appreciate as a often-harried reader. It did seem to me that Johnson made a conscious or unconscious identification with Priestley himself -- most clearly in emphasizing his wide-ranging interests (much like the variety of topics covered in Johnson's own oeuvre) and in praising him for the project they share, the popularization of science.At times I grew a bit skeptical of Johnson's claims for the centrality of Priestley, and in general I thought the book too short to do full credit to the historical context. The section on Priestley's role in the Jefferson and Adams correspondence is one example where I felt we got only a mere taste rather than a full meal. (Other reviewers have likened the book to a long magazine article.) So maybe more of a 4.5 than 5 stars from me, but I'll give it the bump to 5 because I appreciate the spirit of the book in promoting the central importance of science (and indeed, of broad-minded thinking in general) to civic and political discourse. I hope the book is widely read for that reason."
17,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,4,"I found this a fascinating read. It centers on Joseph Priestly, the late 18th century scientist, philosopher, and religious dissenter. Priestly was an ordained minister who engaged in scientific studies of electricity and the chemistry of gases (hence the title). He invented soda water, and is credited with the discovery of oxygen, although that is a complex story, made clear by the book. Priestly was involved with some wonderful learned sociecities, like the Royal Society and the Honest Whigs. He was a close friend of Benjamin Franklin when he lived in London. Priestly did have some scientific shortcomings, like his adherence to the phlogiston theory, and had a lively competition with Lavoisier. Priestly became a scientific rationalist that led him to religious dissention. He became a Unitarian, and wrote many sermons consistent with the Age of Reason. He, and many of his friends were sympathetic to the French Revolution, at least in principle, because they were philosophically committed to the notion of reason and human improvement which would necessarily sweet away some older institutions. None the less, his religion and politics led to mob violence against him, burning his home, destroying his laboratory and forcing him to flee to America. He became friends first with John Adams, and later with Jefferson, and tended to gravitate toward the latter. It is interesting to note that in their famous exchange of letters, Jefferson and Adams mention George Washington five times, and :Priestly 50 times. Priestly really condensed the great arguments of our democracy around him, and is an unsung hero of our foundation. "
18,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"I could write my own review, but there is really no reason to when the New York Times has so effectively captured my thoughts about  The Invention of Air . The review can be seen here.Johnson uses the life story of Joseph Priestly (18th century scientist and one of the discoverers of oxygen) as a means to illustrate connections between the disparate fields of energy, religion, the French and American revolutions, the scientific method and the ways in which paradigm shifts occur (among a host of other diverse and unrelated topics). It’s a shame he didn’t stick to the history of Priestly, since this is by far the most interesting part of the story. Instead, Johnson provides a snippet of Priestly’s life, then uses it as a launching pad to expound upon an unrelated (and more often than not, uninteresting) topic. In addition to being forced, these digressions are, as the Times points out …. “annoying”, and “a kind of book-length game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon in which everything that ever was and ever will be is linked to everything else.”That about nails it. Also, the book is rather boring. "
19,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1782531-mark,4,"Joseph Priestly will forever be remembered as the man who discovered and isolated oxygen. It turns out that he was not the first to do so, but the first to recognize the importance of his discovery and to publish his results. He was not the one who named the substance either, but still, he gets the credit. However, his greatest achievement, scientifically, took another two hundred years for anyone to fully appreciate. His discovery that plants refreshed the air and kept an animal alive long beyond when it would have expired in a closed system without plants has led to the science of ecosystems, the study of the inter-relatedness of all living creatures on the earth. Yet, he is largely unrecognized for this. He was a true amateur scientist, a theologian of some repute, and great liberal thinker who had a hand in the formation of the ideas upon which the United States was founded. As a friend and confidant of Benjamin Franklin, and later of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, Priestly had great influence upon those gentlemen and their radical ideas. This book gives one a brief overview of how that all came about and proved to be a fascinating read, as well. And this from one who does not normally read a lot of history, but the science is what attracted me."
20,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3009803-eileen-daly-boas,4,"This isn't a biography of Joseph Priestley, and it isn't a full historical summary of England and the beginning of America. It's not a scientific monograph, and in some ways, it's not history of science, either. But it is a good, sweeping tale that includes everything from dinosaurs and gigantic dragonflies to the French revolution and the Alien and Sedition Act in the United States. If you read this as something it's not, you won't like it. If you think that Johnson is only promoting the view of science with a long lens, you're wrong there too. He's given a good overview of how one man can be a good starting place for looking backwards and forwards at science, politics and religion. If you ever liked the tv show, ""Connections with James Burke,"" then you'll like this book. If you're an expert in science, religion or politics, you probably will think he's skimmed over things too quickly.  I liked this book, knowing almost nothing of Priestley, and only a little more about Franklin, Lavoisier, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. There's a nice section on the importance of coffee and coffee shops in Europe, and that makes me want to go back and read David Liss' The Coffee Trader. That's a great novel, by the way."
21,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368201-meri,4,"Joseph Priestly is not widely recognized, but may as well have been a (British) founding father. A product of a remarkable age, Priestly produced a string of innovations in science, religion, and politics. He was eventually exiled from England for his agnostic views, but he died a respected man in a young United States. In this book, Johnson has taken an interesting figure and turned him into a metaphor for explosions of progress (like the Age of Enlightenment) and how seemingly separate disciplines can all advance rapidly at once. He talks about change and how we must be prepared to redefine our values, practices, or even definitions of reality to truly move forward as a society. Though the New York Times gripes that this is clearly not a biography, I won't fault Johnson for his digressions into the history of ideas, coffeehouse culture, and the connection between the fossil fuels that facilitate the destruction of our ecosystem and the discovery of said ecosystem thanks to the leisure time afforded us by fossil fuels. After all, if anything is to be learned from Priestly's practice of experimenting aimlessly, sometimes it helps not to follow a plan."
22,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724379-nick,4,"Johnson did an excellent job of putting a life and a time period into interwoven context. By modern standards, Priestley would be considered a ""talented amateur"" in the field of science, basically flinging experiments at a subject until it yielded results. His willingness to experiment with politics and religion as well got him into remarkable amounts of trouble, including a literal mob with torches coming to destroy his home.My only minor quibbles were that several of his actual discoveries were barely mentioned, and the author made no effort to reconcile his seemingly conflicting religious, scientific and political beliefs and thought processes. How could the same man be one of the founders of rational Unitarianism and also believe in a literal interpretation of the book of Revelations? Why did he refuse to give up on the ""phlogiston"" theories that made him a scientific dinosaur? How could he fail to see the excesses of the French Revolution, especially after the death of his peer Lavoisier at their hands? These questions are not answered by this book, which is a shame."
23,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan,4,"This was fascinating, and more technical/scientific/philosophical than books I've grown used to reading. Provides a decent mental workout of following the arguments he makes, but not difficult at all. It's interesting to hear Priestley's experiments explained, but I was expecting him to have a little more influence on American Founding Fathers. Definitely interesting he had influence at all, but the contact was essentially a bunch of letters between him and Franklin, and a few between him and Jefferson. After the blurb talked it up so much, Johnson almost skips past it. Interesting to hear of his ideas about Christianity, which truly seems to have helped berth the Jefferson Bible. He definitely got stuck on this stupid theory of ""phlogiston"" which I think is totally silly and possesses an absurd name. I don't often read biographies, but this made me glad I watched HBO's John Adams, and made me want to read a good biography about Ben Franklin (and not Priestley)! The book wandered a bit, but I'm glad he did his research and wrote about religion and progressive politics. "

He was pals with Benjamin Franklin, Antoine Lavoisier, John Adams (who compared him to Socrates), and Thomas Jefferson. He was a founder of the Unitarian movement. He wrote many works of philosophy and helped found utilitarianism. And he invented soda water. This guy, an Englishman, was pro-American Revolution, pro-French Revolution, and antimonarchist. He believed in God but insisted that Jesus was not divine and that most of Christianity was fake paganism. A mob burned his house down.Like all the Steven Johnson books I've read, this is supposed to be about one thing (Joseph Priestley, cholera, neuroscience, ants, video games) but is really about the spread of ideas. Although this is my least favorite book of his, it's still good. "

Unfortunately this seems to have backfired, resulting in a scrappy scattergun collection of chapters, at once too brief and too loose, veering often into shallow hagiography (not just of Priestley but e.g. in a digression that felt especially cut&pasted from something else, of Thomas Kuhn), ending abruptly on a screechy-preachy (and I'm the choir!) 'Hear Ye, America' about Science and Faith and Politics, when Johnson's strengths have always lain, for me, on the lowercase, revisionist, complexifying side.Enough sparkling passages and brilliantly communicated ideas to still rate a 3, and send me haring off in search of a good biography of Mary Priestley."

36,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1751300-richard,4,"Steven Johnson has written a coherent history of one of the most important scientists of the Enlightenment, one whose name is known mostly to modern readers for being mentioned in biographies of others who corresponded with him, especially Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. This book goes far to plug the hole of biographies of important Colonial and early American Republic characters, but Johnson intends to go beyond that task. He is known for his promotion of information networks as conduits for the processes which advance civilization. A popular science writer, he was a columnist for Discover Magazine, Slate and Wired. His news discussion site, Plastic.com is a Weblog award winner. Among his books is ""Everything Bad is Good for You."" His newest is ""Where Good Ideas Come From"", about the natural history of innovation.Johnson explains how centuries-old societal preconceptions were falling in bunches in the mid-to late-eighteenth century. This was where the discipline of ""natural philosophy"" developed, leading to floods of scientific discoveries amid previously-unknown challenges to the authority of king and church. In the case of England, where Priestly lived as a science hobbyist while preaching at a church in Warrington, the intellectual ferment of the 1760's in England was stoked by the freely exchanged ideas of the leading thinkers who gathered in coffeehouses. This was all facilitated by the rise of coffee over beer as the most popular social drinking medium at the time. The friendly atmosphere arising from meetings where theories were freely discussed and results of experimentation in a number of fields of study were disclosed without reverting to secrecy supported Johnson's central doctrine that the big ideas of history resulted from collaborative efforts from numerous sources, bouncing their ideas off each other, rather than the hackneyed version of scientific discovery developing from lone geniuses laboring over their microscopes, looking for eureka moments to spring from their minds. Priestly was fascinated by the accounts he read of experiments in the new exciting field of electricity. He traveled to London to meet the scientists he had read about and was welcomed into the group self-described as the ""Honest Whigs""; their most famous member was probably the most Anglophile American, Benjamin Franklin. The two became close friends and began a collaboration which benefitted each other many times, starting with Franklin's recommendation for Priestly's proposed encyclopedia of all of the electrical experimentation to date to be supplemented with the results of his own experimentation, thus elevating Priestly from a chronicler of other peoples' work to that of a leading scientific experimenter. The resulting book, ""The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original Experiments"" not only became a standard reference work on the subject for decades, it enhanced the already growing international reputation of Franklin as a scientific thinker. The book's description of his experiment of trying to capture electricity from lightning with a kite was the source of the public's knowledge of this aspect of Franklin's career. The big breakthrough of Priestly's book was its disclosure of a whole new way of looking at science. The old Newtonian way of pronouncement of cause and effects, then proving them, was replaced with the idea of natural philosophy as a story in progress, with new discoveries building on the previous ones. A career advancement which led to his move to a larger parsonage in Leeds, with more time available for experimentation, led to the most important discoveries of his career. I believe the heart of the book and its most interesting section is Johnson's description of Priestly's series of experiments in the 1770's. He worked tirelessly with an air pump to put living things, plants or mice for instance, under glass covers where new air could not enter. His huge discovery came in 1771 when he placed a sprig of mint under glass later adding a live mouse in that space. Surprisingly, the mouse did not die instantly, as had happened numerous times when mice were placed under a dome without a plant present. For the first time in history, someone had discovered the creation of ""restored air"" where previously the space taken up by air was considered to simply be empty space. This is Johnson's basis for his title. During 1774-1775, Priestly made himself famous as the discoverer of oxygen with his experimental vaporization of mercury calx with a powerful magnifying glass. The resulting mysterious substance was a gas which allowed mice to live longer under glass. Johnson points out the paradox of Priestly being celebrated for a discovery that was not entirely his own while being seldom mentioned for his indisputable lead in finding the role of plants in creating breathable air, thus forming the basis for the study of Earth's environment. His discovery of oxygen needs to contain an asterisk, since the element had actually been isolated, but not reported widely, by Carl Scheele between 1771 and 1772. Worse yet, Priestly never grasped the role of oxygen in combustion. He stubbornly stuck to the old-school belief in an invisible substance, phlogiston, as the catalyst which allowed objects to burn. His rival, Antoine Lavoisier, would discover oxygen's properties and even give the element its name. Priestly would travel to America in 1794 and end his years there. His emigration was not by choice, however much he had sympathized with the Americans in their revolt against England. The seeds of his banishment from England were sown in the great successes of his earlier discoveries. He had relocated to Birmingham, England in 1780, after a break in his relationship with his former patron, Lord Shelburne. Birmingham was in the center of England's new Industrial Revolution, and Priestly soon would be able to support a rich lifestyle by working as an earlier type scientific consultant to the wealthy industrialists. One benefit of this arrangement was his ability to have his business associates fund the custom designed scientific tools he required for his particular experimentsAlthough Priestly would actively continue with his research, he would devote more time to his other passions. Having proven to be a transformative figure in the fields of electricity and chemistry, he would also prove to be a revolutionary influence in the fields of politics and faith. He was an original thinker in an age of innovators. He firmly believed all fields, including religion, needed to constantly have their status quo challenged by new ideas. Thus, he became a colleague of Theophilus Lindsey in his new Unitarian church. He published a book in 1782, ""History of the Corruptions of Christianity"", in which he chipped away at all of the supernatural baggage that he saw Christianity laboring under since the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Keep in mind that Priestly had an unshakable Christian faith. However, his challenges to the religion's most cherished tenets, especially the concept of the Trinity, marked him as a heretic. This was no small charge to face in England, where any challenge to the established Church of England could result in serious sanctions.Priestly's desire to blow away the old order, literally using the analogy of gunpowder to explode error and superstition, was extended to his admiration for the French Revolution, going on across the channel. Its greatest excesses, including the beheading of the king (Lavoisier would also eventually succumb to it) were still in the future. However, many who had serious reservations toward the movement would prove to be on the right side of history. These included Edmund Burke, whose famous ""Reflections on the Revolution in France"" rebutted Priestly and his friends. Events caught up with Priestly and other radical thinkers in 1791, when a reactionary group called the ""Church and King"" movement, backed by conservative elites, became incited against religious dissenters of the Church of England, industrial magnates who were destroying England's agrarian countryside, and alleged regicides seeking to end British monarchy. Priestly was clearly in their crosshairs. Events came to a head with the mob violence in Birmingham in July of that year. Priestly and many of his friends who celebrated the French Revolution had to run for their lives from the mob; he and others were burned out of their homes. From that point, he had to live a circumspect life until his son traveled to America and reported back favorably about the new community of Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, where the family could regroup and hopefully join other outcast emigres from England in the asylum of a welcoming land.Priestly would spend his last years in that tiny community in the back woods where the two branches of the Susquehanna met. Other intellectual outcasts from England did not join him there. His physical isolation from the stimulation of the American cities was alleviated in part by his active correspondence with his friends and admirers, including Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Adams had originally urged him to settle in Boston, while Jefferson would later beg him to resettle in Virginia. The great ideological rift which resulted in the rival American political parties would cool his relationship with Adams when his outspoken views made him a potential target for that administrations hugely controversial Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson would openly credit Priestly's ""Corruptions"" for providing the framework for his own deist religious beliefs, and would rely on Priestly for advice on the curriculum of the new university he was designing in Virginia. Johnson points out how the mutual affection for these two founding fathers for Priestly became the reason for not only their reestablishment of correspondence after many years of bitter enmity, but continued to provide fodder for them to continue a respectful debate in their letters for the rest of their lives.Johnson notes that Priestly would agree that his roving, untutored intelligence was not suited for defining the structure of scientific study. His genius was appropriate for exploding old conventions; for pushing his science into a revolutionary mode. Priestly said of himself, in effect, that he was fated to be a kind of comet, visiting the world unexpectedly and moving away just as swiftly, becoming extinct in a great flash. This may explain why there are many who do not fully understand his contributions after two hundred years."
37,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today's post is on The Invention of Air: A Story of Science, Faith, Revolution, and The Birth of America by Steven Johnson. It is 254 pages long and is published by Riverhead Books. The cover is red with cut outs that have different pictures in them. The intended reader is someone who is interested in natural history, scientific history, and history itself. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The Invention of Air is a story of sweeping historical transformation, of genius and friendship, violence and world-changing ideas, that boldly recasts our understanding of the most significant events in our history.It centers on the story of Joseph Priestley—scientist and minister, protégé of Benjamin Franklin, friend of Thomas Jefferson—an eighteenth-century radical thinker who played key roles in the invention of ecosystem science, the discovery of oxygen, the founding of the Unitarian church, and the intellectual development of the United States. Priestley represented a unique synthesis: by the 1780s, he had established himself as one of the world's most celebrated scientists, most prominent religious figures, and most outspoken political thinkers. Yet he would also have become one of the most hated men in all of his native England. When an angry mob burned down his house in Birmingham, Priestley and his family set sail for Pennsylvania.In the nascent United States, Priestley hoped to find the freedom to bridge the disciplines that had governed his life, to find a quiet lab and a receptive pulpit. Once he arrived, as a result of his close relationships with the Founding Fathers—Jefferson credited Priestley as the man who prevented him from abandoning Christianity—Priestley found himself at the center of what would go down as one of the seminal debates in American history. And as Johnson brilliant charts, Priestley exerted profound if little-known influence on the shape and course of this great experiment in nation-building.Review- Another interesting Johnson book about stuff I knew nothing about. Johnson follows Priestly from his childhood into the last minutes of his life and we get to see some very interesting things with him. Priestly gave so much to modern science that I had no idea about but even as I read it I was horrified by some of the experiments that he did but the only reason we can be horrified by the experiments if because he did them and discovered what exactly he was doing. Add in some of the most famous people of his time and you have a who's who is the 1700's. Johnson helps the modern reader to understand the hows and the whys of Priestley's time and how important it was that he be born at that time and in that place because if he was just a little off in either he would not have been the scientist he was. Very enjoyable and an excellent read. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
38,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21137355-jeri-rowe,4,"I liked this book more than I thought. Like everyone, I had never heard of Joseph Priestley. He was this maverick minister and inventor (how 'bout that combination) who influenced Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Ben Franklin. Hang out with those guys, too. But like those folks, Priestley is more of a footnote in our early American history. Johnson tried to change all that, with the help of ""The Invention of Air.""Well, it worked. Johnson did it with his writing. But he also did it with his research. He's a science writer, a real 21st century inventor himself, and he found material that really made Priestley a real three-dimensional character in American history. Like with this quote from Priestley Johnson found:""It may be my fate to be a kind of comet, or flaming meteor in science in the regions of which (like enough to a meteor) I made my appearance very lately, and very unexpectedly; and therefore, like a meteor, it may be my destiny to move very swiftly, burn away with great heat and violence, and become as suddenly extinct.""Priestley wrote that in 1775. Then, you get something like this from Johnson.""The American experiment was, literally, an experiment, like one of Priestley's elaborate concoctions in the Fair Hill lab; a system of causes and effects, checks and balances, that could only be truly tested by running the experiment with live subjects. The political order was to be celebrated not because it the force of law, or divine right, or a standing army behind it. Its strength came form its internal balance, or homeostasis, its ability to rein in and subdue efforts to destabilize it.""Nice, right?Anyway, you get that kind of analysis through the book. As for why this book, Johnson wrote: ""This is my version of a Founding Fathers book, and a reminder that most of the Enlightenment was driven by open source ideals.""But how does air got to do with Priestley? Well, read the book. You'll see. And that ... is incredibly interesting.Who knew?"
39,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22227266-vicki-gibson,4,"Steven Johnson is not (at least in this book) the best storyteller. His style of writing, which I didn't particularly care for, is a bit scattered. That said, Joseph Priestley is a fascinating historical character. I knew very little about him so I'm glad I read this book and learned about Priestley's influence in the broader context of his era. A brilliant chemist, Priestly discovered that plants synthesize oxygen which subsequently led to the discovery and isolation of oxygen. (Credit for the discovery of oxygen is a bit murky but Priestly was definitely in the mix.) He invented soda water. He was the founder of Unitarianism. His interest and expertise in science, religion, and politics had a profound impact on history. His friendships with Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson greatly influenced the lives and thinking of these Founding Fathers. In the Author's Note, Johnson states, ""If there is an overarching moral to this story, it is that vital fields of intellectual achievement cannot be cordoned off from one another and relegated to the specialists, that politics can and should be usefully informed by the insights of science."" For me, this was a recurring theme while reading this book - the contrast and comparisons to our current political era. I think Priestly, Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson would be disappointed in us. "
40,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109356728-dfour,4,"While not strictly a biography, this book centers on the life of Joseph Priestley: an exceptionally interesting person who had profound influences on science, religion, and politics through-out the late 18th century. Since I knew very little about Priestley going in, there was much for me to learn, and I particularly appreciated learning as much as I did in a concise little book of ~250 pages or so.Given his contributions to the foundation of ecosystem science, the founding of the Unitarian Church, and personal relationships with both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, I am somewhat perplexed I did know so little before reading this book. Maybe for people who are already knowledgeable of all these things, the book might disappoint. However, people like me (Joseph Who?) will gain much reading it.Curiously, among Priestley's accomplishments is the creation of A New Chart of History. I re-scanned the likely sections of the book and index, and strangely did not see any mention or reference. I wonder at the omission in a book that largely celebrates Priestley's achievements."
41,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185313-debra,4," A book that I have wanted to read for a long time tempted me by being in an audio format. Priestley shows up on my radar because of his PA residency and his ties to Franklin. Priestley's Norththumberland home is only 2 hours from my home. This book condenses a great deal of time and information into a relatively short book, but gives an understandable review of Priestley's life, inquisitive nature, religious propensities and discoveries. I often wondered why he left England for Pennsylvania and settled into an area so remote. I also had to remind myself that the science facts we all learned as children were cutting edge scientific knowledge at the time and not accepted by all. My only complaint with the book was that Johnson inserted his own opinions on faith in a few passages. I did not appreciate his description of John's revelation as "" hallucinatory visions of Revelation"", making it sound as if the man was on drugs. It tended to make me distrust some of his other assessments about Priestley and his convictions in other areas. "
42,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10835551-david,5,"This fascinating book gives insight into one of the best scientific minds of the eighteenth century; and yet, virtually unknown to most people. Joseph Priestly became a protege of Benjamin Franklin and friend of Thomas Jefferson and they corresponded and discussed many ideas and theories about science, politics, religion, and other topics. As indicated by the title of this book, he had performed numerous experiments that explored the makeup of the air we breath that had been little researched until he began his investigations into why a spider, for example, died in a sealed jar after so many minutes, likewise for a plant, but when they were placed together they lasted much longer. This is how he determined that the exhale from one was what the other needed to survive. A little technical but nothing that anyone with high school education should have any trouble with. Great read."
43,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598468-debbie,4,"I don't read a lot of non-fiction books, but this one is exceptional in its organization and expanse. Johnson starts with a plan: to write about the discovery and isolation of oxygen. Not a biography of Joseph Priestly, mind you, but just a close-zoom on the work he did to lead to a better understanding of air and its components. But this book then does a long-zoom out to the rest of the world before, during, and after Priestly's experiments - what was happening in the United States and France and Germany. What was happening in the science world, the economic world, and the political world. He even major-rewinds to the prehistoric era and describes why Priestly's discovery was able to be discovered by him at the time and place that he did. It's a pretty amazing, well-organized, and mostly-engaging text and I loved seeing how all these things were tied together."
44,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,5,"Review title: A Comet in the system of science, politics, and faithAfter reading Johnson's latest, How we got to now, I found this book from 2008 on the shelf in my excellent local public library, and discovered that contains a tightly argued statement of Johnson's cultural ecosystem approach to science and history. How....now applies the approach to six key innovations, but The Invention of air gives the approach a solid logical foundation. And in case a reader wanted to question the current relevance of the intersection of science, politics, and faith, Johnson provides a telling list of issues that are centered on this flash point: ""global warming, stem-cell research, intelligent design, neuroscience, atomic energy, the genomic revolution, not to mention the massive social disruptions introduced by computer science in the form of the Internet."" (p. 205).Joseph Priestley is the man who first isolated oxygen in the title ""discovery"", just one of the paradigm shifts driven by Priestley in chemistry, electricity, faith, and politics. He was a key participant in the transition from rise and fall to steady state cultural progress. Johnson identifies three theories of why this transition occurred:1. Marx's theory of class, capital and technology that focused on the interaction of these resources over long time horizons driving inevitable outcomes not influenced by ""great men"" actors.2. Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts from normal to revolutionary science that drive progress forward in revolutionary leaps. 3. His own ecosystem theory that traces progress across multiple disciplines (including ""soft"" and non-sciences) and multiple languages, vocabularies, metrics, and time scales in the ""long zoom"" view he further elaborates in How....now.Johnson doesn't dismiss ""great man"" theories out of hand, recognizing the biographical element in discovery present in the case of a rare man like Priestley:--Hunches driven by curiousity to know the ""why?"" of things.--Intelligence capable of exploring the hunches.--Time to explore the hunches (leisure time made available by economic growth driven by the rise of industry).--Time to allow the hunches to develop by not being focused only on the short term gain.--Integration into a ""neural network"" of informal information exchange that serendipitously and exponentially drives innovative thinking. Johnson takes a short but fascinating aside into the role of the London coffeehouse mania of the period in providing that neural network for men like Priestley. These informal (not bound or burdened by procedural rules), multidisciplinary (free flowing between branches of science, politics, and faith), and caffeine-fueled (not alcohol dulled) discussions were essential and highly-valued by the men who had the ideas, the intelligence, and leisure time to join with their colleagues at the local coffeehouse.At some of these sessions Priestley was able to meet and exchange ideas with fellow scientist and political observer Ben Franklin. While Franklin would find his career driven increasingly into politics and statesmanship (to his expressed regret in his letters to Priestley) their initial introductions and conversations were about understanding the results and ramifications of their scientific studies, and sharing knowledge and speculation in conversations (at the coffeehouse and in letters) that were literally ""inventing . . . the ecosystem view of the world."" (p. 82).The third input (in addition to cultural and biographical drivers) into the invention of air was energy. ""Major advances . . . are almost invariably triggered by dramatic increases in the flow of energy through society"" (p. 113). In Priestley's day the transition was from wind and horsepower to coal and steam power. The link is that increased energy applied to industrial production increases wealth and makes leisure time available. It takes personal time and energy to innovate, and Priestly did most of his scientific work when he was supported either by a wealthy noble patron or by industrial sponsors who funded him essentially as an independent research and development adjunct to their industrial organizations.So Priestley ""invented"" air. But he never compartmentalized his science, his faith (he was by trade a minister), and his politics (continuing correspondence with his American colleagues even in the midst of the revolutionary split between the colonies and England.). His religious ideas (Unitarian and denying the divinity of Jesus) were considered heretical by mainstream Christians and his political ideas were considered radical. He was sympathetic with the French ferment for revolution, and he was falsely accused of being a French spy. Facing persecution for his unpopular views culminating in the burning of his house and laboratory by a mob, he fled to America, where even there he was held at arms length by correspondents Adams and Jefferson because of his religious views and their political positions. But he never wavered in his optimism or approach, and both Adams and Jefferson, even 20 years after Priestley's death, remembered him in their famous final correspondence with respect and fondness.Because of the depth to which Johnson develops his long zoom approach to science and history I found this book more focused and rate it slightly higher as a classic than How . . . now. But both are fast, fun, and easy to read whether your interest is in science, history, politics, and faith. Leave your compartments at the door and enter with your whole mind."

I was hopeful that the sections about, you know, Joseph Priestley -- rather than some pretentious bullshit -- would grow more frequent as the book wore on, but they didn't seem to. Instead, what there was of narrative kept disappearing behind drifting icebergs of pompous pseudo-intellectualism. After the third or fourth time I found myself lost in wanky speculation about why discovery happens, I grew exhausted. But even that would have been okay, if Mr. Johnson showed any chops in the Sociology department. He didn't. What could have been a tiresome but reasonably informed consideration of social themes became what felt like a HJ to the kind of self-congratulatory entrepreneurs who make their underpaid personal assistants read books like this and write up a 100-word summary said entrepreneur never gets around to reading. Bravo, Mr. Johnson! You have achieved maximum wankerdom."
46,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36205036-steve-harvey,4,"I chanced upon this in the audiobooks section of the library. The fascinating story of Joseph Priestley, perhaps the first biochemist. (He worked out the relationship between plants and animals, and between oxygen and carbon dioxide). He was also a religious free thinker who left Britain and moved to Philadelphia, where he got to know Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and other American scientists and politicians. Highly recommended if you're interested in the history of science and/or the religious and philosophical foundations of the United States."
47,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15995010-ian-woods,5,"This is the kind of book that restores your sense of wonder about the world. It’s the best Narrative Nonfiction i’ve ever read. Joseph Priestly’s life is the fascinating through-line off of which Johnson hangs a dizzyingly multidisciplinary array of essays about the formation of thoughts, the Carboniferous Era, Paradigm Shifts, atmospheric O2 levels and more. It will make you smarter and much, much happier for it"
48,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71064969-mark-sy,3,"One of Steven Johnson’s more average booksJohnson always does a good job introducing historical characters and their greatness. Priestly is yet another one which I found inspiring and interesting. Johnson tries to balance and duality between priestly’s scientific achievement and his political career as it repeatedly intersects however I did find those sections devoted to his political side a bit boring and dragging. At the end, I was struggling to just finish the book. "
49,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10533802-tammie-painter,4,"In his usual style, Steven Johnson makes connections between dinosaurs, coffee houses, chance introductions, the American Revolution, and.....the discovery of the elemental components of air. Overall, it's the story of Joseph Priestly and his discovery of oxygen, but Johnson untangles all the social, political, religious, and historical threads that enabled Priestly to perform his experiments. It ends up being an entertaining and easy-to-read tale while still being chockfull of information."
50,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69939287-anne,2,"Didn't hold my attention throughout. Needed to listen to this book twice to get the gist. Author's note at the beginning is key - this is more a ""biography of ideas"" than a biography of a person. That said, it was interesting to learn about Joseph Priestly's role in chemistry, religion, and politics, and his relationships with Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson."
51,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015297-carl,2,"I was expecting more emphasis on the actual discovery of the oxygen and how Priestley came to understand its chemical role in photosynthesis and oxidation. Which it turns out, he might never actually have understood. Way too much discussion of the intellectual and political aspects of his life, for me."
52,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127141-rhys,3,"If you like the idea of scientific processes openly working for general betterment; that progress is based on a willingness to change; or that politics should better embrace rational thought and governance that includes a scientific and virtuous worldview, then you may like this story of 'Gunpowder Joe' Priestly. "
53,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811514-kathy,4,"Fascinating. More an exploration of Priestly’s role in Enlightenment science and how that science functioned in society than a biography per se. I loved the diversions into geology and biology. I picked it up mainly because I was interested in Priestly as an early Unitarian, which isn’t much discussed. I liked it anyway. "
54,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52176561-jvetrone,5,"One of the better non-fiction writers keeps you thinking without overtaxing your brain.neat historical perspective of how the US gov't survived in the 1st 3 presidents.science, religion, and politics all shape another in the 1800's age of Reasoning/Enlightenment."
55,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55479211-francisco-lima,3,"A very thorough account of the scientific achievements from Joseph Priestley, and the repercussions in the delicate political sphere back then among England, France and the newborn US. A good case against Donald Trump & Co."
56,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15026495-duane,4,"It's hard to imagine a modern with the range and depth of Joseph Priestly. He created a new religion, discovered oxygen, and did science on the nature of electricity, hobnobbed with Ben Franklin, and caused a riot, fled his country of birth and was pals with two American presidents. "
57,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56682622-raymond-goss,4,"I would give this book 3.5 stars. It discusses Joseph Priestley's discoveries and political interactions with Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and others. I was less familiar with this part of history before reading this material. Good material for Ben Franklin fans."
58,1594488525,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4659122-ngaio,3,"This is a nice overview of an interesting man and his time. It doesn't go in-depth on the many topics it touches upon (micro-history style), but it does give one the sense of the age and how one person could affect so many. "
