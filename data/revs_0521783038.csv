0,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,5,"This is the third book of Carl Sagan's work's, that I have read recently. Yet again, Mr Sagan has not left me disappointed.This book consists of a collection of short essays on subjects that can be most complex, but Sagan explains it all, in such a way, so that we can all understand and enjoy it. It tells us about the Solar system, and touches on the topic of extraterrestrial life. Maybe the best thing about reading Sagans books, is I can hear his voice talking when reading. Even though this book is rather dated now, it most definitely makes for a riveting and interesting read. Thank you Mr Sagan."
1,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"One thing that is so attractive about Sagan is his ability to be humbled in the face of someone else’s intelligence, including a room full of first graders. “A friend asked me to come to talk to his class,” Sagan writes in one essay in The Cosmic Connection, “which, he assured me, knew nothing about astronomy but was eager to learn.” So Sagan goes to his young friend’s class, armed with slides of colorful gaseous nebulas to entertain the kiddies, and then makes the mistake of asking the class how mankind figured out the earth was round. One kid pipes up with the example of a ship’s master sinking beneath the horizon as it sails away from you. A second says what about an ellipse, you know, when you can see that the moon is round? Another says, well, what about that guy Magello who sailed around the world? You can’t sail around the world if it isn’t round. A fourth kid says, hey, don’t you know there’s pictures of earth from space, and the pictures are all round? And then a fifth kid says, oh, yeah? What about the Foucault pendulum experiment? First graders, all. It is a considerably chastened astronomer who goes home from school that day, and Sagan’s not too proud to say so."
2,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528129-ade-reads,4,"Finished another glorious book by Carl Sagan which is fantastic as usual. Here are some highlights :From the first chapter, “A Transitional Animal”, describing the 5-billion year history of Earth.""In Man, not only is adaptive information acquired in the lifetime of a single individual, but it is passed on extra-genetically through learning, through books, through education. It is this, more than anything else, that has raised Man to his present pre-eminent status on the planet Earth.""""We are the product of 4.5 billion years of fortuitous, slow, biological evolution. There is no reason to think that the evolutionary process has stopped. Man is a transitional animal. He is not the climax of creation.""Three chapters explore motivations for space exploration on three points: scientific interest, public interest, historical interest. Pages 51-52:""The universe is vast and awesome, and for the first time we are becoming a part of it.""""The planets are no longer wandering lights in the evening sky. For centuries, Man lived in a universe that seemed safe and cozy — even tidy. Earth was the cynosure of creation and Man the pinnacle of mortal life. But these quaint and comforting notions have not stood the test of time. We now know that we live on a tiny clod of rock and metal, a planet smaller than some relatively minor features in the clouds of Jupiter and inconsiderable when compared with a modest sunspot.…These realizations of the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions are profound — and, to some, disturbing. But they bring with them compensatory insights. We realize our deep connectedness with other life forms, both simple and complex. We know that the atoms that make us up were synthesized in the interiors of previous generations of dying stars. We are aware of our deep connection, both in form and in matter, with the rest of the universe. The cosmos revealed to us by the new advances in astronomy and biology is far grander and more awesome than the tidy world of our ancestors. And we are becoming a part of it, the cosmos as it is, not the cosmos of our desires.""Page 53.6: ""A fundamental area of common interest is the problem of perspective. The exploration of space permits us to see our planet and ourselves in a new light. We are like linguists on an isolated island where only one language is spoken. We can construct general theories of language, but we have only one example to examine. It is unlikely that our understanding of language will have the generaltiy that a mature science of human linguistics requires.""And as an aside, topics that are controversial today are not new, they’ve been around for decades, e.g. p57: ""But we live in a time when the atmosphere of Earth is being strongly modified by the activities of Man. It is of the first importance to understand precisely what happened on Venus so that an accidental recapitulation on Earth of the runaway Venus greenhouse can be avoided.""Chapter 9, about the historical interest of space exploration:""But it is remarkable that the nations and epochs marked by the greatest flowering of exploration are also marked by the greatest culture exuberance. In part, this must be because of the contact with new things, new ways of life, and new modes of thought unknown to a closec culture, with its vast energies turned inward.""Followed by historical examples, especially how the age of European exploration to the ‘new world’ coincided with Montaigne, Shakespeare, the authors of the King James Bible, Cervantes, et al.""In all the history of mankind, there will be only one generation that will be first to explore the Solar System, one generation for which, in childhood, the planets are distant and indistinct discs moving through the night sky, and for which, in old age, the planets are places, diverse new worlds in course of exploration.…A human infant begins to achieve maturity by the experimental discovery that he is not the whole of the universe. The same is true of societies engaged in the exploration of their surroundings. The perspective carried by space exploration may hasten the maturation of mankind — a maturation that cannot come too soon.""He’s being optimistic about the pace of interplanetary exploration, perhaps, but the principle is valid.Chapter 10 is a cute account of giving a talk to first-graders who do, to author’s surprise, understand why we know the Earth is round.Chapter 11 describes the crank mail the author receives, from all manner of crazies, and a case study about a man in an asylum and how he was certain the planets are inhabited. (Because of his personal encouter with “God Almighty”.)Other chapters in Part II involve the incompetence of the CIA and/or Air Force Intelligence; Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Mars novels as the inspiration for so many; more comments about humanity’s influence on the environment (p142); a restatement of the passage from p69, on p155 (“There is a generation of men and women for whom, in their youth, the planets were unimaginably distant points of light…”); and Sagan’s ‘belief’ that there would be semi permanent bases on the Moon by the 1980s.Section III includes chapters about dolphins, concerning John Lilly, how the author was ‘propositioned’ by a dolphin, and how our disregard for dolphins and whales parallels the dehumanization of human enemies to make them easier to kill, and what this implies about potential contact with extraterrestrials; one about Sagan’s advice to Stanley Kubrick about depicting the aliens in 2001 (don’t depict them, imply their presence indirectly, advice which seems to have been taken)… and Chapter 26, the title chapter, “The Cosmic Connection”, which contrasts the presistent interest in astrology (“In his vanity, Man imagined the universe designed for his benefit and organized for his use” and p186.7, “It satisfied an almost unspoken need to feel a significance for humans beings in a vast and awesome cosmos…”) with the reality of our heritage, as a species on a planet of relatively heavy elements, elements the result of stellar evolution: ""The fate of individual human beings may not now be connected in a deep way with the rest of the universe, but the matter out of which each of us is made is intimately tied to processes that occurred immense intervals of time and enormous distances in space away from us. Our Sun is a second- or third-generation star. All of the rocky and metallic material we stand on, the iron in our blood, the calcium in our teeth, the carbon in our genes were produced billions of years ago in the interior of a red giant star. We are made of star-stuff.""Other chapters concern extraterrestrial life as an “idea whose time has come”, focusing on the likelihood of other planetary system [he would so gratified by the recent Kepler discoveries]; a dismissal of the idea that UFOs are evidence of ETs having visited us, mostly on statistical grounds…. artifacts put forward as evidence, especially by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods, a bestselling book that has since languished into obscurity (I still own the paperback edition depicted on the Wikipedia page), of visitations by alien astronauts in ancient times… p207: ""These artifacts are, in fact, psychological projective tests. People can see in them what they wish. There is nothing to prevent anyone from seeing signs of past extraterrestrial visitations all about him. But to a person with an even mildly skeptical mind, the evidence is unconvincing. Because the significance of such a discovery would be so enormous, we must employ the most critical reasoning and the most skeptical attitudes in approaching such data. The data do not pass such tests.""Sagan contemplates what it would mean if we succeeded in contact with ETs, via radio signals, even considering the likely decades-long pace of the exchange. p218:""The scientific, logical, cultural, and ethical knowledge to be gained by tuning into galactic transmissions may be, in the long run, the most profound single event in the history of our civilization. There will be information in what we will no longer be able to call the humanities — because our communicants will not be human. There will be a deparochialization of the way we view the cosmos and ourselves.""Final chapters expand into considerations of astroengineering (Dyson spheres), classifications of cosmic civilizations, how long it would take for a ‘galactic cultural exchange’ to happen [always assuming the speed of light limitation for communication and travel], and speculation that (the then recent idea of) black holes might serve as a kind of cosmic transportation system.The last three chapters are expansions on the idea of “starfolk” — histories and projections of the universe and mankind’s place in it. Here’s the last paragraph of the second of those chapters (p262).""The births of stars generate the planetary nurseries of life. The lives of stars provide the energy upon which life depends. The deaths of stars produce the implements for the continued development of life in other parts of the Galaxy. If there are on the planets of dying stars intelligent beings unable to escape their fate, they may at least derive some comfort from the thought that the death of their star, the event that will cause their own extinction, will, nevertheless, provide the means for continued biological advance of the starfolk on a million other worlds."""
3,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24372433-vikas-lather,5,"Wow!!! Happy birthday Carl Sagan. You would have been 79 today. It's almost like a magical reality to read your book as a tribute, unintentionally and accidentally, on your birthday.  After the discovery of your birth date, I can only imagine by this random co-incidence, an ordinary mind like myself from a different sub-continent, who is not currently engaged in any scientific pursuit, is reading your book purely for entertainment and enlightenment. This is what you have to know, to understand how beautiful and imaginative your work is.I may be somewhat biased to say that it is sad to see that people are loosing scientific temper; however you are the best astrophysicist author, an intelligent gift to humanity who will continue to inspire young mind around the planet. "
4,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"This collection of essays is a justifiable predecessor, in many ways including the chronological order, of Carl Sagan's latter books. The topics that are briefly brushed upon here, have been thoroughly explored in his subsequent works and this piece of text does well to introduce to the reader all those aspects of planetary astronomy and sub-fields of it; namely exploration, terraforming and colonization of planets, communications with extra-terrestrial and terrestrial non-human intelligences, understanding of planetary geology to understand our own planet etc.In his very familiar eloquent and ascetic manner, Sagan tells the reader about his/her place in the Universe in an essay Unicorn of Cetus, it shows the place of Sun among other stars and constellations as seen from elsewhere in the Galaxy. He tells about our efforts with searching and communicating with extra-terrestrial intelligence and how he had designed the Voyager Golden Record and Pioneer 10 & 11 plaques that were sent into space as messages from humanity to other worlds. One of the point that he emphasizes that our tendency to anthropomorphize the aliens is quite futile and it is extremely unlikely that they'll understand anything transmitted to them in conventional communication code, and that was taken care of when preparing those messages by incorporating into them audio-visuals along with descriptions of universally known scientific phenomena such as spectrum of Hydrogen atom.He makes a point to explain the benefits of space exploration to humanity and seems quite optimistic about human endeavours in space. However, this book being published in 1973, it turned out that governments were reluctant to fund the exploratory agencies and we haven't achieved anything akin to what he had prophesized in those times.In the next part, the exploration of Mars and Venus is described with exquisite details about their environment, geology and terraforming possibilities. His visionary approach regarding the future of human enterprise is embraced by anyone who reads and understands these ideas but as it always has been the case, our governments and majority of populace are often short-sighted and tend to neglect the long-term plans which need to be employed if we want to insure the survival of human race by voyaging to other planets, considering what a mess we have already made of the tiny, fragile and the only planet we have.Surging forward, we encounter his illustrious musings upon non-human terrestrial intelligences such as Dolphins and Whales, and some features of extra-terrestrial intelligences. It seems very plausible to look in this matter with a different perspective other than that of humans, we must try to study other kind of intelligences and find out what aspects of intelligence are universal and what aspects are unique to us humans. It would help us establish a prospering galactic community, were we ever to discover and befriend other intelligences.In the last section that is mostly speculative, but nonetheless based on sound scientific arguments, Sagan wonders about sharing of knowledge among various intelligences in the Galaxy and the galactic cultural homogenization that may take place akin to global cultural homogenization happening right now on our planet.As always, he never fails to enthrall the reader with his evocative and inspiring authorship and makes us want to resume the feat which he had left for us unfinished.

His writing style is flowing, easy and funny. His optimism and fascination towards the science and cosmos are inspiring.I loved most of his essays about space explorations and ideas. Some were a bit repetitive and boring, so I skipped those parts. However most of them were enjoyable. Kitabı uzun müddətə oxumağıma baxmayaraq çox hissəsini bəyəndim. Carl Saganın dili axıcı və sadə, bir o qədər də əyləncəlidir. İdeaları və kosmosa qarşı olan hədsiz marağı oxucunu həyəcanlandırır. Bəzi hissələrini sürətli keçirməyimə baxmayaraq, kitabdan həzz aldım. "
6,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,3,"Carl Sagan's collection of short essays on all things cosmic is a very interesting and enjoyable read. The author presents cosmology, physics, biology and nuclear electrickery that can be understood by small children. (Somebody fetch me a small child.) His views of the universe from some thirty years back are still relevant and topical today. Not certain I agree with his ideas on extra terrestrial life forms and our ability to locate same. None the less, Sagan throws in human history, chemistry and the odd scraps of atomic theories to accompany us on his grand tour of our solar system and beyond.Carl was such a cool dude. Almost a sixties hippy, his written work should be compulsory reading matter. We are stardust. We are golden, and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden. "

You are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style, and when I read what you write, I hear you talking. One thing about the book made me nervous. It was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than I am. I hate that.” —Isaac Asimov to Carl Sagan"
8,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"Superb, just like anything Sagan wrote. I look at Sagan’s writings and teachings the way some people look at the Bible for inspiration and guidance "
9,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,3,"Although outdated, it is an interesting reading, with a lot of funny moments from Sagan's experience."
10,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32722-erica,4,"For awhile, I've sided with the late Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki's view of space exploration. In his 1969 speech, he says of the moon landing: ""to me it is not so interesting a thing."" He's trying, I think, to make his listeners aware of human's insatiable appetite for the next shiny thing, the thing outside ourselves that will make us satisfied. Going inside ourselves, Zen, is the antidote to this material searching. After seeing ""Gravity"" I thought the same thing: why would anyone want to go to cold, lonely space? We still don't understand so much about our tenuously verdant home planet. Perhaps we should put our house in order and evolve a little bit before we start zipping around the galaxy.But Carl Sagan is selling me on space. The motto for the International Space Station is ""off the earth, for the earth"". Contrary to Suzuki's views, perhaps going into space *is* going inside ourselves. What was so striking about the Apollo mission was not that astronauts went to the moon, but that they saw the earth and its inhabitants from a revelatory new perspective. The mind-boggling features of our universe tell us something about our frail humanity and our origins in the stars. Maybe Suzuki is right: maybe ""right here"" is enough. But could going ""out there"" help us realize what home means?I've not even touched on the book itself, my first reading of Sagan. His popularity makes perfect sense: the writing is joyously accessible, full of paradigm-shifting perspectives that will have you constantly referencing the internet for photos of Mars' moons or neutron stars. I've left this with four stars (stars, heh) for the slight lack of cohesiveness and the dated nature of some of the material, but I'm eager for more of his stuff. "
11,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"""Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective"", the tenth Carl's book I've read so far, is a collection of essays by the one and only Carl Sagan during the 60s and 70s. Most of the chapters later were improved with exquisitely detailed explanations by Carl himself in his next books. His experience working with NASA on space missions, his surprising day with schoolchildren, his perspectives on extraterrestrial and terrestrial intelligence, scientific histories of Mars and Venus, terraforming planets, our connection with the stars and other interesting topics were crammed into this beautiful piece of writing. After the publication of this book, we have since sent space probes to other worlds in order to dig their mysteries, which makes our previous speculations outdated, but I personally think the book still did a wonderful job in offering me many thought-provoking ideas related to our lives in the universe."
12,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3571355-eric-peterson,4,"Much of the information is now dated but the book is still a compelling, cogent and well thought out argument for a continuing and active human presence in space. The gutting of the manned NASA missions by the Carter administration shortly after this was published and the struggle for both funding and clear cut purpose following the end of the Apollo program make the optimistic tone of the book ring somewhat hollow today, but just imagine what if..."
13,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77170844-ben-truong,5,"Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective is an anthology of essays or scientific papers written by Carl Sagan and edited by Jerome Agel. In this particular edition, there are also contributors from Ann Druyan, Freeman Dyson, and David Morrison. This anthology explores humanity's place in the grand scheme of things – in a galactic or even universal sense.Carl Sagan covers several topics, and focuses mainly on the possibility of extra-terrestrial intelligence, the likelihood of the existence of more advanced civilizations, and their distribution in the local galaxy, and in the universe. He describes the hypothetical opinions of more advanced intelligence and their views of the Earth, as well as communication with humankind.For the most part, I really like most of these essays – if not all of them. Carl Sagan has the unique ability to take complex scientific concepts and ideas and dilute them down so simply that a nonprofessional could understand. He does it in such a manner that does not sound condescending, but rather approached everything in a quiet humble manner. Like most anthologies, there are weaker contributions, but I think this one might be an exception to the rule, because I generally liked this book.All in all, Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective is a wonderful anthology about humanity's place in the universe."
14,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86406472-kole,3,"I found Carl Sagan's book to be quite fascinating. Being published in 1970, it had quite a few interesting ideas that we now think differently about. One of the most interesting things I found was that at the time he referenced the world's human population to be 3.6 Billion, it's incredible that in our modern time we see our world filled with over 7 billion people. Another part that I loved in the book was his writing about dolphins. It was quite fascinating to see the studies he discovered and how psychologically and behaviorally similar we may be: dolphins, like humans, like to study things and sometimes like to study and discover our patterns; it's almost like dolphins want to train humans. Personally, I love astronomy and found Sagan's stories incredible and interesting. I realize that not everyone would think the same about this book. I would only recommend this book to people who have an interest in sciences. Not specifically astronomy though, because his book touches on a wide variety of sciences including biology, oceanography, geology, astrophysics/physics and many others. "
15,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19115351-nisus,3,"Written in 1973, only four years after man landed on the Moon, by the great astronomer and science communicator Carl Sagan (1934-1996), this book is a huge demonstration of the impact of the moon experience on the scientific minds of that period. Sagan worked for NASA as an assistant since the 50s. Therefore he was directly involved in the successful Apollo II mission. The new perspectives open to humankind by that remarkable event were fascinating, and Sagan, being particularly fond of such astronomical conjectures, tried to develop here in this essay an analysis of the possibilities and responsibilities of the human race before [what seemed for the author to be] the inevitable first encounter with alien life forms. This book reads more as a huge collection of astronomy figures than as a valid argument for the existence of extraterrestrial life. Being a scientist, Sagan is able to offer his readers all he knew about the structure and the composition of the universe, the position of man and his planet in the Solar System and the Milky Way, the absurdly high number of stars in the universe, the unbelievably big distance between earth and any other possible inhabited planet. He goes so far as to demonstrate why life, as we know it, was impossible on planets like Mars, Venus and Jupiter, yet could be a hidden possibility in relatively unknown places such as the satellites of Mars and Jupiter. There are plenty of pictures, and the figures are often difficult to grasp. I mean, you read about “a universe with billions and billions of stars” as if there were any possibility of you ever understanding what this could mean [you keep asking yourself, how on earth could they have access to such data?], you read about black holes as cosmic gateways, you read about Einstein’s theory of relativity and how it changed the old notions of space and time, you read all these things much like you’d read a fiction book. Plenty of data, plenty of possibilities, scarcely any plausible ground to tread on. I guess that, when read back in 1973 this book was an exciting reading. Sagan talks about manned mission on Mars as a foreseeable event in the near future. We now know he would eventually die without seeing it. He minutely describes a message sent together with the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, back when it was launched in March 1972. This “message” [a plaque with a drawing of a man and a woman in a friendly attitude, and an scheme of the Solar System, clearly indicating the planet the two creatures came from] was subject to a long discussion, because it was thought that, in case an alien civilization ever found that spacecraft, it could be a proof that there was intelligent life on earth, and that it was “amicable”. The most “humorous” passage of the book is exactly the part when Sagan remembers what controversy followed the divulgation of that message, some people considering it to be misogynist (the woman in the picture is behind the man, and it's the man who makes the friendly gesture), and others considering it to be meaningless. When we think of the idea of a “message” from earth ever reaching an alien race (and being understood by this race), the mere effort seems to be pointless. And, in a matter of fact, the author does his best to convince us that humankind would incredibly benefit from an encounter with alien life forms. Why? Succinctly, because Sagan was optimistic, and he believed that, with the unbelievable progress man had made since he first arrived on earth, there was no way of denying that earth, with her ever growing population, was becoming too small for humankind. Man had already “mastered”, “conquered” his native planet. It was time for him to broaden his horizon. Fully aware that there were inextricable barriers of time and space (after all, we would need only 600 000 years of space travel, in the velocity of light, to reach the center of our galaxy!), Sagan counted on both the theory of relativity and the black hole hypothesis to ascertain his belief that the “conquest of space” was possible to man, and possible in a foreseeable future. Sagan was no lunatic. He did not believe in the ever popular UFO’s stories. He didn't believe in astrology, and he didn't believe that humankind was a byproduct of alien biochemistry. He was skeptical and he brought data to the table. He worked for NASA and so he lived the 1969 experience fully. He did not want to deceive his readers or delude himself: he emphasized that there was NO available data to confirm either the existence of extraterrestrials or their presence on earth. We could as well be, judging from his own perspective, entirely alone in the universe. He seemed, however, to have high expectations on this field of exploration. He obviously saw the bright side of things. He did not seem to ponder what would be the implications of an “encounter” of humans and aliens. He also seemed not to be fully aware of the political interests of the USA in the so called space race. One can't help but think what human beings, who have been so far incapable of accepting and understanding differences as insignificant as skin color or sexual preference, would do when face to face with creatures totally different from themselves, possibly more intelligent and powerful, but maybe weaker and inexperienced. Would we try to slave them? Would we try to steal their riches? Would we try to cooperate with them? In which manner, the way we cooperate today? Or the way we have cooperated in the course of history with all the other peoples on earth, devising any possible means of stealing each other’s riches? Would our children want some blue or green E.T. for a pet? We need to be honest and face such questions. Because the truth is, humankind being the way it has been so far, I’d strongly advise any alien civilization to remain as distant in space and time from humankind as it can be! We are still alone, Carl. "
16,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76979837-eric-bettencourt,5,"It's a fascinating read if only for getting a ground-level view at the kinds of things that were occupying Sagan's brilliant mind during the early 70's. Much of the subject matter such as the grand expanse of the cosmos, the possibility that were are not alone and general inquiries into the origins of life on Earth will all be covered in more depth in his later more popular works. But here his wonderfully clear writing style and eloquent (if not masterful) use of language to convey the dense subject matter is fully-formed and being used with confidence and skill. Here Sagan has already started to bridge the gap between science and a curious public."
17,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16362429-vance-j,4,"Written in 1973, I thought this book holds up really well 45 years later. Nice insights on our place in the cosmos, and has some of Sagan’s most well-know points:Examples: “We are made of star stuff” (p.190); “Civilizations...beyond us should have sciences and technologies so far beyond our present capabilities as to be indistinguishable from magic.” (p. 222)Even after 45 years, I found Sagan’s writing to be engaging and very thoughtful. I read it in two days. Good stuff here."

Mr. Sagan was both an amazing scientist and an amazing communicator of science to the general public. I had much pleasure reading this book to my 3-year old daughter as well as consuming it to myself. Much love, respect and admiration for the great sage. "

I loved the part on the pioneer’s golden plaque, the debate around it and the many weird comments he got in the mail. it’s also rather interesting to read which of his predictions came true (probes to the sun just recently!) and which didn’t (moon colonies). an interesting read overall."

But the conditions changed. The organisms were too specialized. They died. Other organisms were less well adapted but they were more generalized. The conditions changed, the climate varied, but the organisms were able to continue. Many more species of organisms have died during the history of the Earth than are alive today. The secret of evolution is time and death.” “Human beings can survive only buy killing other organisms. But we can make ecological compensation by also growing other organisms; by encouraging the forest; by preventing the wholesale slaughter of organisms such as seals and whales, imagined to have industrial or commercial value; by outlawing gratuitous hunting, by making the environment of Earth more livable—for all its inhabitants.” “In the cosmic perspective there is no reason to think that we are the first or the last or the best.” “And then one day there came to be a creature whose genetic material was in no major way different from the self-replicating molecular collectives of any of the other organisms on his planet, which he called Earth. But he was able to ponder the mystery of his origins, the strange and tortuous path by which he had emerged from star-stuff. He was the matter of the cosmos, contemplating itself. He considered the problematical and enigmatic question of his future. He called himself Man. He was one of the starfolk. And he longed to return to the stars.” “It is the intimate connection between stars and life. Our planet was formed from the dregs of star-stuff. The atoms necessary for the origin of life were cooked in the interiors of red giant stars. These atoms were forced together, to form complex organic molecules, by ultraviolet light and thunder and lightning, all produced by the radiation of our neighboring Sun. When the food supply ran short, green-plant photosynthesis developed, driven again by sunlight, the sunlight off which almost all the organisms on Earth, and certainly everyone we know, live out their days.” "

Small consolation as I wish I read this sooner. Then I would have gathered that the plaque from the Pioneer 10 spacecraft was one of the images seen in David Bowie's last album for the song ""Girl Loves Me"", it was positioned in the center of the 20 pointed star.Sigh. Also at the start of the chapter that has the very diagram mentioned, concerning the way constellations change based on the view point of the observer: ""In the Book of Judges there is an account of a slain lion discovered to be infested by a hive of bees, a strange and apparently pointless incident. But the constellation Leo in the night sky is adjacent to a cluster of stars, visible on a clear night as a fuzzy patch of light, called Praesepe. From its telescopic appearance, modern astronomers call it 'The Beehive'.""Visual reference of pioneer 10 and Bowie album art: https://mobile.twitter.com/cboshuizen...Really, really wish I had picked this up sooner. I love all the references dotted throughout and Sagan's ability to be kinda smart ass with certain types of limited view points (people complaining about the depiction of sexual characteristics on Pioneer 10 plaque, for instance) but also keenly sensitive to real criticism regarding race, gender, prejudice, and sexism. Also like his thoughts on the treatment of other species who share intelligence and have been evolving along side of us. It's a book told in three parts: cosmic perspective of us living out our lives on Earth, second part is our solar system, and third is an exploration of what an alien intelligence might have evolved into independently of our experience on Earth. Also love the quotes and art interspersed between chapters (at least one Escher image, and T.S. Eliot quote along with scifi art from others), and Sagan's own photos like his pic of three Dolphins ""conversing with the author"" and the rain God depicted on the temple of the Sun at San Juan Teotihuacán, Mexico and all the scientific diagrams and pics from the Mariner 9.

The Nazis achieved this goal comprehensively by declaring whole peoples 'untermenschen', subhumans. It was then permissible, after such declassification, to deprive these peoples of civil liberties, enslave them, and murder them. For Americans, covert reclassifications of other peoples as untermenschen has been the lubricant of military and economic machinery, from the early wars against the American Indians to our most recent military involvements, where other human beings, military adversaries but inheritors of an ancient culture, are decried as gooks, slopeheads, slanteyes, and son on--a litany of dehumanization--until our soldiers and airmen could feel comfortable at slaughtering them.Automated warfare and aerial destruction of unseen targets make such dehumanization all the easier. It increases the 'efficiency' of warfare because it undercuts our sympathies with our fellow creatures. If we do not see whom we kill, we feel not nearly so bad about murder. And if we can so easily rationalize the slaughter of others of our own species, how much more difficult will it be to have a reverence for intelligent individuals of different species?""concepts to explore:-terraforming-solar sailing"

It does provide, however, a very lucid description of the origins of the solar system, the development of life and its progression and wider place in the universe (at least as understood up to the early 1970s when it was written).Our space probes are discussed, including the Pioneer probes which Sagan himself worked on -- I hadn't realised that there was such controversy over the plaques that were mounted on Pioneers 10 and 11 -- and he describes how they were used to develop and test theories about the planets of the solar system.Sagan isn't afraid to speculate about the possibility of life on other worlds and the possible means of listening for them, and maybe even communicating with them. This willingness to delve into what a lot of scientists may consider unsavoury territory is part of what makes Sagan's work so charming.The only issue that I had with the book is its age. Some of his more optimistic predictions have already been proven wrong (like his suggestion of a permanent moonbase by now). I would love to read a contemporary piece that discusses the history of human spaceflight the way that Sagan has, but brings it up to date, charting all the successes and failures since Sagan's day.In total, a charming and well-written description of man and his relationship with the universe.

32,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7350929-shaun-ling,4,"I knew about the book from the documentary Cosmos: A Space Odyssey (2014) hosted by Neil Degrasse Tyson. It was a book given by Carl (the author) to Neil during their meeting as a teenager.The book talks about the gold plaque aboard the spacecraft Pioneer 10, which was designed by Carl Sagan and his wife. There are interesting reactions from people and is told in the book.There are some interesting discussion on why alien hasn't visited us (Fermi paradox), the way to search for them, is it wise to search for them, etc. The search of alien life has to be rid of human chauvinism, alien life may not be similar to life on earth. The book also goes through the journey on how Venus is found out to be a sort of hell like instead of the beautiful planet people onced imagined, this fact is known due to scientific method.There are some dated scientific fact such as the cause of dissapearance of dinosaur (attributed to climate change, but now known to be caused by meteor), but most of the facts are grounded. The chapter on starfolk fable is interesting because it showed us how we get complex elements from Hydrogen and Helium. Then how life got started.The books ends with neutron star/ pulsar and black holes, these were theoretical space objects that scientists had hypothesised which later found out to exists. Pulsars are used as ""space candle"" to measure distance. And black hole is left to the wonders of the reader as a possible ""space station"" to traverse the long distance of space."
33,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8236455-susannah-bell,5,"The Cosmic Connection is directed squarely at the layman. There’s no “heavy” science in it at all and not a formula in sight. The chapters are short, each one an essay. The biggest surprise is how funny Carl Sagan is. In one chapter, he goes to a primary school prepared to entertain rather than teach. When he asks the kids if they could think of any evidence that the earth is round, he is faintly gobsmacked by the intelligence of the answers. I found myself riveted by some of the stories. For example, the response to Pioneer 10 gold plaque, which he helped create, is extensively discussed. Some of it is truly hysterical, particularly the responses in the press and the imagined discussions amongst aliens. Surprisingly, the book hasn’t dated at all, despite being published in 1973. His visions of the future are charming and quite wonderfully idealistic. His optimism is unrestrained. I’ve only ever read one other of his books, Contact (made into a movie with Jodie Foster); The Cosmic Connection has inspired me to read more. It is an accessible introduction to the idea of man in space and has a broad appeal that will never be lost, no matter how far we go or how many probes we send flying off into the dark."
34,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944905-happy-hedgehog,3,"In reading this book I am convinced that most of it was over my head. That said, I did grasp the gist of what was being said, and chapters 10 and 11 were very entertaining. At the start of the introduction by Ann Druyan, a quote by Sagan is inserted which, ironically, is from one of his other books; Cosmos. Here is part of it: ""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another."" The kind of haunting loneliness that emanates from this statement is a common theme in this book, recurring in many chapters where contact with extraterrestrial life is discussed. Chapters 37, 38, and 39, (the last chapters in the book) are a beautifully described overview of the origins of life, the death of stars, and possible space exploration through black-holes. If one chooses to only read part of the book, these ones would be well worth their time. "
35,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30650164-spencer-trinh,3,"the epilogue provides some up-to-date corrections on some of sagan's predictions when he wrote the book which i felt was very important to the acceptance of sagan's theme. i also thought it was interesting to see what 30+ years of studies research and development has done to the face of astrophysics in terms of what we know and what we can deduce. nevertheless, sagan is fluent and articulate in his expertise and really allows the reader to enjoy this difficult to grasp subject. if one has already read cosmos, this book is simply a less lyrical version without photos. but since he wrote this prior to cosmos, it is completely understandable. some passages i think were paraphrased and rendered more melodious for the grandeur of cosmos.

His sense of awe helps to make reading about science so interesting. This book explores the solar system and the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and it touches on the origin of the universe. Although it was written in 1974, making some of the information outdated, much of it is still relevant. This version contains an update at the end, written in 2000 by David Morrison, which makes the book a little more fulfilling - telling us where some of Sagan's speculation turned out to be right, where it turned out to be wrong, and what is still unknown."

This was my second try with this book that contains some of the material shown later in the series.Chapters about the early exploration of Venus and Mars, for example, give a nice flashback and an inside view of a great story. But as he speaks of his achievements and experiences all the time, randomly, we can only imagine that the outlandish perspective of the title is his own. Some of his views are biased (biology is not expected to profit more from Mars exploration than other sciences I think). I would recommend the series instead, it's more focused on the cosmos itself."
38,0521783038,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4519991-kate,4,"Read this book to be reinspired about the universe - its exploration, possibilities, and wonder. I really liked his arguments for why we should explore other planets, especially with his scientific background. This book is more like a series of essays or lectures, it jumps around a bit. It leaves me wanting more on each subject. However one sentence can snap at your perceptions and leave you thinking for days. That's neat."

When Carl Sagan was life, everyone was exciting about Cosmos and Extraterrestrial life. Sometimes I imagine like Sagan will be happy to hear that liquid water was found on the Mars.
