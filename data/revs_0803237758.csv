0,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1511395-mike,1,"I picked this book up at the library hoping it would provide an accurate critique of green technologies and was sorely disappointed. It is very weak on the science and economics of each technology and very biased toward the model of everyone living in dense urban areas and using mass transit - complete with personal references to glorious periods of time lived abroad in energy paradise and fear mongering anecdotes to scare everyone away from each technology.The errors begin no later than page 7 where the author claims solar photovoltaics would cost $44T to manufacture - a number so outrageously inflated that it is clear the author did not take the same graduate level EE solar cell class that I did in 1991 when I was required to do the same estimate. Dr. Dieter Schroder would have given him an ""F"" for being orders of magnitude off. Tens of billions - yes. Tens of trillions - nowhere near that. The size of the automotive and semiconductor industries provide common sense reference points for the errors in his estimate and illustrate that it is not the size of the investment that would be required, but rather how little we value the energy we use - i.e. less than our transportation and communication/information connection costs."

He explains the reality of alternative energies extremely well. I appreciated his point of view and the fact that finally someone is putting into print the realities of the situation. I should have stopped reading there because I would have given it a strong 5 star rating. My love for this book started to wane with the second half of the book where the author connected everything to our piggish use of energy. Everything; teenage acne, sexuality, obesity, blah blah, its all connected. And the ceaseless comparison - well Europeans do it this way and only if us backwards Americans could be more like those Europeans, well, we might stand a chance. We are Americans, not Europeans, and we need solutions for our cultural and socio-economic context. "
2,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9739646-aaron,5,"This is a book both devastatingly honest and realistic about the challenges we face, but also full of reasons to be hopeful. Personally, I think it is the only environmental book that really addresses the inter-connectedness of the many challenges we're confronting as a society, and Zehner does so with searing intelligence and quite a bit of humour. His critiques are forceful without being pedantic or accusatory. And his writing is extremely accessible and engaging. What's particularly impressive is that Zehner grounds his analysis in social science scholarship, yet you never feel like you're reading an academic book. He reminds us that scholarship cannot only show us where we've gone wrong in our thinking and actions, but in piercing through the fog of our own desires, carve out a realistic path forward. This is an impressive book that I believe will become a classic not only in specific studies of energy technologies, but for the environmental movement more broadly."

Unfortunately that's an idea which has recently wormed its way into politics, especially since the Paris Climate Change Conference this year. Here in Canada we don't have the time or money to care about the environment anymore unless we're weed-smoking hippies on welfare or middle-class suburb kids who think that just because they don't use soap they're saving whales. It doesn't mean we don't give a damn, but most over here in Nova Scotia are relying on coal and shipbuilding, and out west it's oil. Hearing politicians stand up and say that electric cars and solar panels are the future is actually very depressing in that respect. Does the government here seriously believe that people can fall back on supposed huge amounts of green technology jobs if coal and oil disappear? Canada is economically-unstable enough already! This book doesn't shun environmentalism, in fact it's all for it, but in a more reasonable and practical way. It sheds light on hippies and hypocrites and it also discusses what the real bad apple is - overpopulation and corporate greed. How can these things be stopped or at least controlled? How can people make a difference without imposing their beliefs on others who don't share them? How can environmentalism work without taking things away from people? Green Illusions answers all that and more. "

The first part of the book exposes a lot of the dirty secrets about clean energy. The latter parts deal with how to move forward. And, the ideas seem a lot more convincing and realistic than a lot of the other ideas floating around out there in green tech la la land."
5,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13212975-randall-wallace,5,"On December 9th, 1949, our US Air Force deliberately secretly contaminated the civilian area around Hanford with radioactive iodine to dispassionately study it’s tragic effects on the local populace and plant life. Wow… Would it surprise you to know that our government didn’t do this criminal act once to it’s own citizens but “has sponsored at least several hundred secret releases of radiation throughout the United States”? Double wow… This amazing book is filled with energy/sustainability related facts that are rarely told in order to keep Americans in the dark: Only 10-15% of the nitrogen in synthetic fertilizer gets into the food we eat, the rest goes into the water systems and creates dead zones like in the Gulf of Mexico. Sure, synthetic fertilizer dramatically increased agricultural yields, but who ever tells you that one must always factor in the resultant whopping 810% increase in energy inputs required against the much smaller 346% Green Revolution increase in production? In the US we built our towns and cities on the best soil (located near waterways) which is now trapped thoughtlessly under asphalt. Most Americans don’t know that the Clean Water Act doesn’t limit coal related pollutants such as arsenic and lead on purpose (thank you lobbyists). The best example of what deregulation in practice looks like is the Niger Delta today. Ozzie exposes the scam behind LEED certification and smartly posits that our energy crisis is cultural rather than technological. What’s our energy future? Years ago, our great-great-grandparents thought petroleum would save the day because now the whales didn’t have to disappear due to demand for whale oil. Today, once again we believe we think we have solved the problem – this time with our false green celebrities: Solar and Wind Power. But beyond the fact that they alone won’t cut it, you just can’t have a sustainable economy without a 90% reduction in energy use and a huge increase in women’s rights, community, re-localization, simplicity, humility, and service. Why not expect solar, wind or technology to save us? Read this great book and find out…"

7,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,5,"Latest book I read was Green Illusions by Ozzie Zehner. For once it was a book I have no preconceptions and I didn't really have a clue what was coming. I don't even know how I actually picked it up and ordered it, but I'm glad I did.Green Illusions is a book explaining what current green initiatives there are ongoing in the world and why many of those will never solve the actual problem of us ruining the globe. It goes through in very detail solar power, wind power and all other electricity based green thinking ventures.Book is provocative and maybe even exaggerating about some of the things, but it definitely makes people think. Raising thought is the sole purpose of the book, so I at least forgive the colorful and bit overstating way on looking at these things. I don't believe all the things are so black and white as proposed in the book, but I do undersign most of the thoughts from the book.Book goes beyond normal green thinking philosophies as it talks about women's rights, population growth, cutting consumption and lot more. It is a comprehensive look on what the problems currently are, why the current solutions don't work and what are the best things to start with for the future.It is an excellent book and really glad I read it. It is bit too much looking the world from American perspective, but that is understandable from the writers background and also because US is big part of the problem and the solution.I recommend this book to everyone. I don't see who shouldn't read this. I really hope this raises thoughts within everyone's head. Maybe this book gets people to not to buy the second car or from building too big house or even cutting the trees from shadowing houses. It is provocative book and no one should buy everything from the book without thinking, but there's a lot to learn for everyone here. Please read it.This review was originally published in my blog - here"
8,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15867666-mac-gray,4,"If this were just some conservative oil loving blowhard's diatribe about how alternative energy sucks I would have never bothered picking up the book. It isn't though. Instead this book demonstrates how we fail to see the amount of production and consumption of energy as the problem and we instead fantasize about a future with all the energy we need powered by wind turbines, solar panels, and hydrogen fuel cells. If you are a liberal who loves solar cells you may hate the first seven chapters which point out the shortcomings of alternative energy, however if you stick around for the whole book it is really worthwhile and you may just rethink your stance on how to go about attempting to solve our energy/climate change problem. Overall i think it is a worthy read. I wouldn't advise getting too caught up with the figures in the early chapters though, the point is alternative energy sources cannot sustain our level of consumption. Just really focus on the main points: increased production will not help our situation, as anyone with basic economic knowledge can see (all increased capacity will do is shift the supply curve and cause market equilibrium to be at a lower price and higher quantity), we need to look to simple cost effective methods to curb consumption (passive solar, smaller housing, walkable and bikeable communities, womens rights, etc.) and the barriers to curbing consumption are primarily social and cultural, not technological."
9,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9462725-andrew,5,"This is a much needed slap in the face to our mainstream environmental movement. The central premise of the book argues that we are focusing far too much on clean energy production to the exclusion of a reduction in energy consumption. For example, we should be promoting more walkable and bikeable urban communities instead of fantasizing about furnishing our suburban McMansion with the latest and greatest electric car, the latter of which is still incredibly resource-intensive and wasteful in its production and disposal phases. There are far more effective methods to protect the planet that already see regular use in other developed nations, but are not flashy enough to sell in our consumerist culture.The author also informs the reader about the environmental downsides to solar, wind, and other alternative technologies. He cites extensively from government and industry sources to make a rigorous case that is still fair and nuanced enough to be mindful of the benefits and drawbacks to each sector.Perhaps the book is strongest in its ability to link environmental issues to social ones. The average eco-friendly citizen would probably not suspect that the plight of women or child advertisement have anything to do with carbon emissions. The author makes a cogent case for their relevance to the green movement.If you read only one book about the environment and the social ills that plague us, make it this one."
10,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9745923-charlie,5,"This is an amazing book that everyone interested in alternative energies should read. In fact I think ALL of our policy makers should have this book as mandatory reading. The book is easily read, fast paced and full of good anecdotes and straight forward thinking on the 'business' of alternative energy sources. Mr. Zehner offers so many practical solutions to our growing energy crisis. Green Illusions will turn your Alternative Energy thinking on it's head. As I said, Green Illusions is a must read for all students, educators and policy makers concerned with the growing energy crisis"
11,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19240873-nyna,5,"Everyone should read this book. At first, it seems to have been written by some oil company, as it points out the shortcomings of green alternative sources of energy. It does present some real eye-opening revelations. The second half of the book covers the social engineering that would help to alleviate our over-consumption of energy. Many of those changes, though admittedly something I would like to see implemented, are too pie-in-the-sky grand to accomplish. It's a book that is very provocative. "
12,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14424666-patrick-johnson,5,I bet this book will change your opinion of putting solar cells on buildings for environmental and health benefits. I definitely thought solar energy through photovoltaic cells was great for the environment. I had overlooked other possibilities. Highly recommend for other environmentally-minded people.
13,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17130414-frank-berg,5,"Zehner, albeit with a confronting voice, attacks pillars of the ""Green Revolution"" bringing needed scrutiny to a movement that has been politicized and undeveloped in the minds of the general public for some time. Most of it surprised me, some didn't. This is a great lens to look at if you're in the Sustainability or Conservation fields. "
14,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14425553-julia-p,5,This isn't a big oil book. It is a Deep Green book. Prof. Zehner tells some great stories and shows the real facts that are hidden by corporate influences (even those you thought were green).
15,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,5,"There are many holy cows in the environmental debate. The imminent dangers of climate change is one. The imperative to completely switch to renewable energy sources as a solution to global warming is another. The debate, however, is highly polarized. In general, if one is politically conservative or to the Right, he develops a confirmation bias against the alarmist prognosis of climate change and the position that renewable energy solutions are a panacea. On the other hand, if one is on the Left or a liberal, then that person develops a confirmation bias towards the dire consequences of Global warming and opts totally for renewable energy solutions. As things stand, Western governments, mainstream environmental movements, establishment scientists and mainstream media have successfully sold us the ideal of total adoption of renewable energy as the way forward. Ozzie Zehner, in this book, takes a critical and refreshing look at this question. He does not question the arguments on climate change or its consequences. Instead, he questions the simplistic notion that all solutions for the problems of climate change begin and end with our total embrace of renewable energy systems like solar power, wind energy, biofuels, hydrogen, geo-thermal, hydropower etc..To start with, the book argues that none of the above-mentioned alternative energy sources are as environmentally beneficial or carbon-negative or even carbon-neutral. Over seven substantial chapters, he takes each one of these renewable sources and exposes what he calls ‘their dirty little secrets’. He shows that the life cycle of bio-fuels eventually results in accelerated climate change due to destruction of rainforests, as per the experience in Brazil; manufacture of solar cells result in large emission of toxic greenhouse gases like hexafluoroethane C2F6, Nitrogen trifluoride NF3 and sulphur hexafluoride SF6 , which are twelve to seventeen thousand times more potent than CO2. ; the life cycle of wind turbines, their production, transport, maintenance and final disposal result in wind power becoming carbon negative. As for hydrogen fuel cells, the production of hydrogen requires more energy than the cell eventually provides. One can use solar power to produce hydrogen but an experiment in California in 1994 showed that it took ten hours to produce one kg of hydrogen, which is equivalet to just a gallon of gasoline. What about other ideas like ‘it takes only 2.6% of the area of the Sahara desert to produce all the power the world needs using solar cells’? With today’s solar cell technology, the author says that it is possible if only we can find $123 trillion to make it happen as well as provide for another $694 billion annually for its maintenance. With all these dampeners on renewable energy solutions, is Zehner saying that we must simply burn coal as usual? No, he says that environmentalists have got it wrong by looking at solutions for ‘clean energy’. He points out that more and more energy availability will only lower costs of energy, thereby generating even more demand for energy. Instead, we need to curb our rampant consumerism without asking the scientists and engineers to solve the problem for us,. To do this, Zehner says it is important that taxation in society must shift focus away from income to consumption. The pricing of goods and services must be recalibrated to reflect their negative effects on the environment in their production. The other thing is to take a good look at packaging in the US as one-third of all garbage generated in the US is packaging material. Other suggestions include moving away from living in the suburbs to cities, which can make communities more walkable and friendly to public transit and allow use of more bicycles and so on. There may be many critiques of Zehner’s position on renewable energy. It is not easily possible for the average person to conclusively determine as to which side is telling the truth. However, when I read about past and present experience in Europe and on proposed plans in California, I am inclined to give credence to many of Zehner’s statements of caution on clean energy. Let us look at some of them. European countries have decades-long experience on Green energy expansion through subsidies. But, recent reports in this decade have concluded that Spain, Germany, UK and France are rolling back subsidies for clean energy because they are unaffordable and unsustainable. Denmark, a clean-energy giant, with more than two decades’ pursuit of wind power, has not seen any reduction in half its energy output still coming from coal. Development of wind power is said to cause loss of jobs in the economy, grid stability problems, high subsidization, higher retail electricity rates, and usage issues. Consumers feel zapped because they have to pay twice for power, once for the renewable power and then again for the back-up system. The subsidies seem to have been too good to last long and make renewable energy viable on this model. All this has happened in spite of wind and solar-generated electricity enjoying subsidies nearly 50 times higher per unit of energy output than ordinary coal and 100 times higher than natural gas.What about our own experience in California? In 2015, a group of scientists, activists and celebrities, led by Mark Jacobson, the director of the Atmosphere and Energy Program at Stanford, released a report called ‘50 States 50 Plans’ in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that lays out individual plans for all 50 states to reach 100 percent renewable energy for all purposes: electricity, transportation, heating and cooling, and industry. It has political support from people like Bernie Sanders. The state of CA seems to be considering a 100% shift to renewable energy by 2045. However, there are others who have questioned the viability of the proposal. In 2017, a rebuttal appeared from a team of prominent researchers in the same journal, saying that the ‘50 states 50 plans’ paper used invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions. Naturally, Mark Jacobson et al defended their paper and accused the critics of allegiance to fossil fuels or nuclear power lobbies. The rebuttal researchers are affiliated with prominent institutions like Carnegie Mellon, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the Brookings Institution, and Stanford University. Their rebuttal includes data on conflict of interest. They caution that incorrect assumptions or miscalculations can lead to spending public resources on the wrong technologies, underestimating the research and development still required, or abandoning sources that might ultimately be necessary to reach the stated goals. As an example, Georgia, which has a coastline of about 100 miles long and a total area of more than 59,000 square miles, is proposed to get 35 percent of its energy from offshore wind—none of which has been developed to date. Alaska, which has a fragmented power system due to its immensity and the remoteness of many communities, is slated to get 70 percent of its energy from wind, both offshore and onshore. These projections are deemed eyebrow-raising and in an era of political gridlock and bitter arguments over climate change, the political barriers also need to be considered as formidable.The other issue which often crops up is battery storage technology. High profile efforts by Elon Musk on his Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada and a 100-MW battery array in South Australia have raised hopes of lithium ion batteries as the solution to balance fluctuating wind and solar energy on the grid. California is mulling four giant lithium-ion storage facilities of 300 MW each, starting by 2020. California is already slated to get 50 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2020, and the legislature is considering a bill that would require it to reach 100 percent by 2045. A detailed article in a reputed MIT journal by James Temple analyses these issues and says that batteries as backup is likely an unaffordable solution. CA currently has 150,000 megawatt-hours of energy storage in total, mainly pumped hydroelectric storage, with a small share of batteries. Assuming lithium-ion batteries will cost only a third of what they do now, building the level of renewable generation and storage necessary to reach the state’s goals would drive up costs exponentially, from $49 per megawatt-hour of generation at 50 percent to $1,612 at 100 percent. Extending it further, meeting 80 percent of US electricity demand with wind and solar would require either a nationwide high-speed transmission system, which can balance renewable generation over hundreds of miles or 12 hours of electricity storage for the whole system. At current prices, the cost would be above $2.5 trillion. In addition, experts say that it takes anywhere from six to ten years to bring a battery technology that works in the lab to the marketplace. These are cautionary notes in the head-long rush towards renewable sources. Given the polarized atmosphere of the debate, it is likely that all of Zehner’s arguments on renewable sources may be dismissed as polemic. But the book asks us to keep an open mind above all the hype and look at cheaper, simpler alternatives through lifestyles. Even if substantial lifestyle changes don’t happen, as has always been the case, it is important for Californians to consider the lessons from the European experience in moving to a 100% renewable future by 2045. The same should be the case before buying into Elon Musk’s vision of batteries as a storage solution for our states and cities."
16,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45836-blaker,4,"I was surprised by how much I liked this. Just scanning some reviews I was prepared for a very polemical and contentious take on alternative energy, possibly from a conservative-in-disguise standpoint, and while it may arguably have been that (except for the conservative part) I also found myself pretty easily agreeing with everything Zehner wrote.The subject is too broad to go over every point here, but the main gist of the book is Zehner's assertion that focusing on alternative methods of energy production is a dangerous and oftentimes deceitful distraction from the only viable solution to our looming environmental cataclysm. The solution is energy reduction. He states it many times: we need to focus on reduction and not production. In this way he is able to identify any poor, irrelevant or misguided proposal for what it is; if at root it's working toward a status quo of continued or increased energy production it is part of the problem, not part of the solution.The most original idea he brings to the debate is his insistence that you can't separate environmentalism from other issues like women's rights (reproductive rights and sex education --> birth control --> population control), military spending (arms production is one of the largest users of fossil fuels and producers of environmental pollutants), city zoning and walkable communities (well-planned communities reduce energy consumption) and income inequality and consumer culture (the wealthy feel entitled to consume and waste in mind-boggling quantities). The section on child advertising is shockingly relevant and eye-opening.I had never thought of environmentalism as inextricably linked to all of these other issues and I appreciate the new perspective. At the same time, linking them together makes ""saving the planet"" feel like an even more daunting task, because outside of women's rights and local zoning ordinances it essentially depends on defeating Big Oil and other mega-corporations that will literally kill before giving up their profit margins.And that's where Zehner comes off as either naive or disingenuous: offering solutions such as voting and campaign finance reform, carbon taxing and other regulations, the creation of a ""Department of Efficiency,"" and decoupling energy profit and production. He is clearly intelligent enough to recognize that all of these ideas are utter pipe dreams in our current political and cultural context. It's hard to envision a scenario short of revolution in which the entrenched monied interests would cede this kind of territory, and an obvious first step would appear to be the revocation of corporate personhood, a virtually impossible task that he never mentions. So I'm a little confused as to how realistic he actually considers his ""solutions.""Other than that the problems with the book were minor. He gets somewhat repetitive toward the end and there is some bloat in the middle chapters on women's rights and the ""Architecture of Community"" where he veers off into fairly tangential territory (the need for bicycle insurance is one of his more bizarre and thankfully short sections). Otherwise, besides some ill-advised pretentions toward lyricism and metaphors, the book was highly readable.More than readable, however, is that this book is capital-i-Important. It's the 2nd Important book I've read in a month after the devastating must-read The New Jim Crow (see my review). This one is not quite as pressing for me because it doesn't directly deal with issues of justice and civil rights, but it's a necessary read nonetheless. Oh, and not to attack another Goodreader, but I'll just say it's rather curious that the top-rated review of this book by a healthy margin is LITERALLY the only one-star review in two pages of ratings -- it's even the only rating of less than three stars. I'm not saying he may not make a good point (although he never responded when asked to back it up), but it's certainly not representative of the overwhelming consensus on this book. I'm not sure how it could have gotten liked so much unless there are certain interests invested in making it more visible. . .But enough conspiracy for the day! Speaking of which, I was way off on my suspicion that Zehner could be some sort of conservative or tea party shill; he's really so far left that he is post-environmentalist (in a good way). And I'm optimistic that this book could become a bible of sorts for post-environmentalism, that it could help reframe the movement so that it becomes more -- ahem -- efficient.Not Bad Reviews@blakerosser1"
17,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349367-larry,4,"This is a book directed towards Americans about their energy usage and how best to obtain it and use it. As such, it accomplishes its task, but it does so in a very uneven way. The beginning chapters are about the alternatives to fossil fuels. Clearly, it is aimed at the ""soft"" environmentalists who think that being an environmentalist is as simple as just opposing what the Republicans want. (No diehard Republican would be caught dead reading this book.) In short, the book quite effectively tears down all the popular ""green"" solutions, for a variety of reasons: too costly, too ""dirty"", too difficult, too inadequate, etc. Moreover, the author points out how getting more ""green"" energy, assuming it was easy to get, would simply increase the demand for energy, rather than replace ""dirty"" energy. At this point, the book shifts gears. Frankly, the author handles the adjustment very poorly. Imagine your high school math teacher being Sir Laurence Olivier dressed as Hamlet. It just was too much ""eloquence"" and not enough rationale. Also, it was sort of like trying to figure out what someone, who is mumbling to themselves, is really talking about. Yet, eventually, after a rather odd section on how a lack of women's rights is a big reason why we use so much energy, only some of which relates to what I, at least, think of as women's rights issues, the author goes into a series of chapters on using less energy and why it would work well, especially since it works elsewhere in the world so well. This is not a perfect book for its purpose, but it is definitely worth reading for what it does accomplish. Read it and be enlightened."
18,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,3,"Before reading the book, I, like many others, was under the impression that alternative energy solutions was the answer to our growing environmental problems. This book is the proverbial other-side-of-the-coin.As an uneducated (at least in the field of alternative energy) the arguments presented make a lot of sense and plausible, though a sceptic might find it to be an anti-greenwash campaign - my mind just cannot fathom that green technologies are not that green, perhaps in my naivety and optimism. Nevertheless, Ozzie manages to clear a lot of myths around and addresses the misconceptions regarding alternative energy. At least now, I can consider myself to be ""informed"" about what my (and the world's) possible options are.Like I mentioned above, the book can open the eyes of many diehard believers (such as me) that perhaps our dreams aren't as rosy as we'd like it to be. However, Ozzie does provide a solution - one that requires an overhauling of human mentalities and tendencies (read - almost impossible today), but it's a start that is being seen in many small pockets of the world today.Good book with good insights and arguments. 3/5 stars."
19,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4817524-rohan,4,"The alternative energy movement/industry has been co-opted by Big Oil and is a massive ruse to get subsidies. Solar power is inefficient. Wind power suffers from unpredictable supply issues and adverse environmental side effects. The risk of nuclear(fission) power is too high. Fusion is unfeasible. Hybrid cars are a red herring and a PR gimmick by the oil and car industries. So where do we go from here?The author's basic premise is that technology is not a panacea and we need to completely revise our way of thinking about energy. ""Jevon's paradox arises again and again in the various incarnations throughout the history of energy use: Increases in energy efficiency make energy services relatively cheaper, encouraging greater consumption"". In other words, correcting energy consumption should be our focus, rather than increasing energy production. Basically, ""Alternative-energy techs are only as durable as the contexts we create for them"". "
20,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27728942-brendan-holly,4,"This book is important. For anyone with any interest in the planet, our society, and sustainability, Green Illusions is a must. Anyone lacking an interest in the aforementioned topics should quickly read up on climate change and environmental degradation. These ""phenomena"" are continually being worsened by our ridiculously excessive consumption. This book shattered the ""alternative energy"" dream that most environmentalists are clinging to for the much less sexy strategy of conservation. Zehner makes the incredibly good point that alternative energy only succeeds when we compare it with fossil fuels. Furthermore, cheaper energy and more energy always result in... more energy usage! Societies need huge doses of social justice, regulation, and conservation before alternative energy should logically be embraced. This book is pivotal as the environmental movement evaluates its options. "

He does offer clear specific (and ethical) examples of how to do these things.The book simply gives the details of these ideas, with a lot of detail especially on why solar cells and wind power aren't terribly amazing. So if you want the details, get this book right away it offers a lot of details."

The author argues that carbon taxes allow other side effects of energy production like radiation, groundwater pollution, and deforestation to go ahead without the same tax penalty. So, energy production would shift to those technologies and leave us with different problems. He argues for ENERGY tax instead, which brings down all energy consumption, not just the carbon based types."

This books sheds light on the fact that all options have downsides (whether it's having to anchor wind turbines 80 feet down into huge concrete slabs (1,700 cubic yards) or how unrecyclable solar panels are at the end of their relatively short lives).Really this is about our learning to do more, with less [energy].Not only did he evaluate these popular green energy alternatives, but he discusses steps we can take and steps that businesses and producers can take to make a real difference. This book may also leave you longing to live in Sweden or The Netherlands.Extremely glad I read this book and I plan on reading ""Green Metropolis"" (per one of his citations) next. Discussion on some of the alternative energy possibilities:Regarding hydrogen power: ""The idea that level of energy use is unimportant and not connected to environmental is constructed by describing fuel cells as intrinsically clean in themselves and producing only water as exhaust"" (119).""Worldwide hydropower provides 15% of the electrical power. Some enthusiastic proponents claim that hydro could grow 3-fold if the planet's capacity were fully exploited. However, tapping into that capacity would displace many thousands of people, disrupt fishing industries, place neighborhoods at greater risk for flooding, and lead to a long list of other problems"" (134).""Natural gas produces less CO2 when burned than other fossil fuels, its extraction operations induce corresponding harms...This geological violent process [fracking]leaves behind copious amounts of injection effluent and permanently alters geological formations surrounding one of the nation's most prized fresh-water sources. Fracking also releases enough methane to more than cancel out any greenhouse-gas benefits that natural gas promoters so aggressively tout...natural gas operations also bring a variety of toxic chemicals and petroleum compounds to the surface. These effluents are often, incidentally, radioactive"" (141).Authors solutions include:Women's Rights""A girl growing up in the US is 5x more likely to become pregnant than a girl growing up in France. And an American girl is 3x more likely than a French girl to undergo an abortion. . . Almost all teenage pregnancies in the US are unplanned BUT so are about 1/2 of other pregnancies. Worldwide there are about 80 million unintended pregnancies every year, which lead to enough offspring to fully populate a Chicago every month"" (218).""An American child born today adds an average of 10,407 tons of CO2 to the carbon legacy of her mother. That's almost 6x more CO2 than the mother's own lifetime emissions. Furthermore, the ecological costs of that child and her children far outweigh even the combined energy-saving choices from all a mother's other good decisions, like buying a fuel-efficient car, recycling, using energy-saving appliances and light bulbs...Just lowering teen birth rates alone to European levels would prevent the need to generate over 30 billion kilowatt-hours of energy annually (the amount required to support this growth in population"" (219).Noteworthy Quotations:""Green labels permit purchasers to believe that the products within create some sort of positive impact on the environment.

31,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,0,"The author points out many issues that “Green energy” production technologies have. For instance, a pervert outcome of billing bio-fuels as green is that farmers use food-production field to farm fuel crops, and cut down rain forests to make up with reduction in food fields. The forest-to-bio-fuel practice ends up putting more greenhouse gases into the air.But perhaps a more problematic issue is that since energy production is illusively green now, people will not make necessary and beneficial energy usage reductions such as riding a bike for short trips. Some of the proposed solutions involve making the hidden environmental costs explicit via certain type of taxation, supporting smart packaging, and enforce legally binding no-junk-mailing laws. "
32,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6865942-claire,4,"This book is in three sections. The first section is a critique of various non-fossil fuel and green energy production options and how they are used in the USA. The second and third sections are Zehner's suggestions of the changes that the USA should make to deal with the future of energy supply and demand. I thoroughly enjoyed the first section. I worked as a trading analyst for a large energy company for ten years. I know quite a bit about energy options for Europe, and the UK in particular. I like facts and figures and thorough, logical analysis. I know from experience that the green options are not as simple or as practical as some would have us believe and I have given plenty of thought to how best to meet the energy needs of my own country, if the world in general. Zehner takes solar panels, wind turbines, biofuels, nuclear generation, hydrogen cells, clean coal and hydropower and discusses each method's use and practicality in the USA. I do not agree with everything that he says, but he raises some excellent points (although he does miss a few things out). I learnt a lot about the way all this works in the USA. Then we move on to the second two sections of the book. This book is so very clearly aimed at Americans (and probably the very un-curious and un-questioning kind who have never left their country) that I found the second half staggeringly obvious, and I skipped through a lot of it. So, Zehner's suggestion for America is this: use less energy. He gives European cities as an example and suggests things such as wasting less energy in the home, consuming less stuff that we do not really need, using our legs for transport from time to time and taxing energy. With the exception of the last thing (I am kind of a supporter of increased nuclear generation, at least in the short term in my own country, so I support carbon trading), I completely agree, especially with the point he makes about dropping the GDP as a measure of anything at all, it's just not meaningful to normal people. My problem with his suggestions is that I think it would take a huge paradigm shift in this country for the US to get anywhere near the “first steps” that Zehner suggests. Stuff like this is just not what the US government is about.I wish the cover had mentioned how very America-focussed this book is. Energy is a global issue and should be considered as such, although I appreciate that it would have been a much heavier book if he had tackled the whole world. We have energy crises of our own going on various European countries, the accelerating growth of power generation in India and China is fascinating, and I am fairly sure the great coal-producing nations of South Africa and Australia may have been interesting to discuss, too.I chose this to read for the Las Vegas Non-Fiction Book Group and I enjoyed discussing this subject with the curious, intelligent and questioning Americans who attended, but I honestly do not believe that they consider any of these suggestions to reduce demand particularly new. I would love to hear how anyone thinks they could be put into effect, though. Because this country loves it's cars, it's packaging, it's washers and dryers, it's AC and it's poorly insulated windows.click here to read the rest of my reviews"
33,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,2,"Even though this may sound like a stupid piece of right-wing propaganda it actually is a very left-wing book. It's not about arguing against environmentalism. It's about making environmentalism better. In some ways it does a good job of that. In others it drives me completely crazy.The main message, that alternative energy technologies aren't really ""good for the environment"" is important. Too many environmentalists are buying into the idea that the more solar panels we manufacture the more we're helping nature, as we're currently seeing with The Green New Deal proposals. The truth is that they're only ""less bad"" than fossil fuels. And depending on the type of economic system we're using the end result might not be much different even if we did get to 100% renewable. This is because infinite growth isn't sustainable no matter what your energy source is. I want to say this should be obvious but the fact that he points this out actually makes him smarter than the vast majority of ""environmentalists"" writing books these days, which is pretty sad considering how stupid some of his conclusions are.My first main criticism of this book is just how exaggerated some of his claims are about the negative effects of ""clean"" energy sources. Some aren't much smarter than Trump's claim that listening to wind turbines causes cancer. It really overcompensates for the rosy predictions of alternative energy advocates by cherry-picking the most negative statistics he could find. It gives the impression that putting solar panels on your house won't save you any money on your energy bill and that will likely even result in more fossil fuel being burned per watt of energy that you consume. Not only is this not true of these technologies as they could be with another decade or two of improved design (not to mention the other alternatives that we all know have been suppressed by big business to keep people buying their shoddy crap) but it's not even true how they were at the time this book was written. His criticisms just go way too far, and I should probably point out that my views on technology are about as pessimistic as it gets. I literally want us to go back to the Stone Age (http://aproposalforprimitivism.blogsp...) so if I'm complaining about this then it's really bad.The other problem is that half of what he considers real solutions are things that should be considered green illusions as well. He talks about urban living and vegetarianism as if they're the complete opposite of what most modern environmentalists believe in. They're actually already part of the package that most environmentalists are currently buying into though. They're ""solutions"" that I was hoping would be critiqued in here, not praised. I know that as things currently are city-dwellers can get their necessities with less fossil fuel per capita than most rural folk. That much is true. I concede that. However, high population densities have the least potential to ever become truly sustainable. They'll never be able to provide for themselves without long distance shipping, destructive building materials that are strong enough to build hundreds of feet high, complex sewer systems that export waste rather than process it into compost, etc. They'll also never be able to transition away from high-tech medicine because large numbers in high population densities are the living conditions that created most of our worst pathogens to begin with. In a lot of ways cities are the root cause of everything that's gone wrong with our species. To advocate urban living is to go against the same logic he uses elsewhere that says being less unsustainable isn't good enough. To be truly sustainable will require us to spread out so we can be more self-sufficient. This is another idea that probably should be obvious to anyone who takes the time to think about it but frankly, it's just not what most people want to hear right now. A controversial book like this one would have been a good opportunity to talk about it but unfortunately this guy doesn't seem to get it.Similarly, I agree that plant based diets are currently less destructive than high meat diets but when you look at what a truly sustainable farm is, there's generally more land growing grass and trees at any given time than annuals (such as corn, wheat, soy, etc.). This is because truly sustainable farms operate more like natural ecosystems, and ecosystems always have animals. The main problem with meat right now is just the psychotic way it's being produced. There's not anything inherently wrong with it, at least at a reasonable scale. Maybe we won't all be eating cheeseburgers and fried chicken every day but it does make sense to keep some meat in our diets. I do respect people who forgo animal products. It is an admirable sacrifice to make. You just have to keep in mind that it isn't ""good for the planet"" to convert all our land into fields of quinoa either. Again, this should have been another example of why a solution is only less bad rather than good. Instead he abandons his own logic and promotes it as the best option. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.He also recommends selling products in small packages so that bicyclists can more easily get them home, which doesn't really work as a way to limit packaging materials when you consider that larger packages have less packaging material per amount of whatever it is they're packaging, and he doesn't give other ""green"" technologies like efficient light bulbs the same scrutiny that he gives solar panels and wind turbines (they also use really toxic materials). Degrowth economics, women's rights and passive solar homes are probably the only solutions in here that I can really say I agree with. He does at least bring up some taboo subjects that others shy away from, like population control, which is good but I totally disagree with him on what truly sustainable societies look like. Between that and his ridiculous exaggerations about alternative energies I just can't recommend this one, which is too bad considering how few writers will even critique infinite growth at this point. I really did want to like this one. "
34,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10696586-josh,3,"His critique of the commonly-held belief that we will be able to innovate our way out of the environmental crises we face with gadgets like wind mills and solar panels is spot on. He documents in undeniable detail how the so-called ""renewable"" technologies are themselves deeply dependent on fossil fuel energy, and largely work only to shift the pollution and carbon emissions onto the third world where Western consumers no longer have to see them. He then mysteriously follows this critique with a whole boatload of statist, authoritarian alternatives that don't address any of the consumerism and destructive economic activity he spent the first half of the book denouncing. Unfortunately Zehner is very keen when it comes to finding fault with technophillic utopias, but no so keen on understanding how those utopian visions are intimately linked with large, complex social organizations like the State. Close but no cigar, Ozzie."

That's just one example.This book also looks at why everyone is so in love with everything green and how we've forgotten what real great is. What about consumption? What about population?

I liked his occasional cheekiness, and loved the perspectives from seemingly unrelated fields he brought in.

43,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89824648-harold,5,"“The cheapest (and cleanest) of energies is the one we don’t use.” Is a common phrase from the energy distributor in my country. This book is all about this truth.From the beginning, Ozzie Zehner makes the statement that this book is for the curious, for those who wonder and want to learn. He doesn’t have all the answers, nor does anybody, but creating this questions, starting the debate, and possible new investigations, is important to make us question our behaviour and help us pop that bubble of the perfect solution for our energy problems. I will like, like anybody else, to see the true numbers behind his comments, but we can know for sure that for most of them, what we says is true.Let’s take a moment to think about the renewable energies we know and have learned about since middle grade. Solar panels take advantage of the sun, Wind Turbines of the wind, Hydro turbines of the rivers and canals, Co-generation plants of the biomass and waste materials, and geothermal of the heat from the core of the earth. A very clean and futuristic way of transforming energy. Sounds awesome, doesn’t it? There are even Pictures or renders of future societies in other planets living their lives from this kind of energy sources, without any sort of waste or problem.Everything have a cost, and everything must be made from something else. For everything we create, many things are lost on the way. Electricity, heat, fuel, time, money, non-renewable resources. Things come from somewhere, even though we don’t think about them very often. This is the reality of the world, and it also applies to the renewable energy movement.The green illusion speaks about the way we have fool ourselves to think that the renewable energy business is the perfect solution to our problems, without questioning its methods, their advocates, of the numbers behind this technologies. Do we really want a Wind Turbine if in its life time will generate more pollution, side effects, and fewer energy than a typical fossil fuel energy plant? Probably most of us have to really think about it, and check the numbers. But the fact is that almost nobody analyse the true numbers behind this, I think most of the people haven’t even asked themselves that question in their lives.The second part of this book talks about the environmental movement, and the scope that future environmentalist should strive to. This is a macro level analysis that neglects the specifics of many nations and societies, but I consider it very much true for all its intentions. Should women rights be an environmental concern? Most of us will probably say no since there is no direct connection between the two, but it will sure impact it. Should we care about residential design in order to develop more efficient homes and subsequently a more efficient way of life? “Absolutely!” would say everybody, since we can directly associate both things.In a way, the last part helps to reinforce the core message of this book, that energy efficiency and minimalism should be the main focus to solve our energy crisis. Creating more energy only leads to more consumption and then more demand. This is a vicious cycle for perpetual growth that we know we cannot sustain, nor can our planet. We must be conscious about our ways of life and act accordingly, only then will we be able to keep our planet safe for and from ourselves."

Those are the types who mainly started criticizing battery chemicals to bash hybrid cars, or suddenly became concerned about mercury in CFLs after being fine with coal emissions.This book breaks through the ""green"" gospel but I was disappointed that ""Wind Power's Flurry of Limitations"" didn't focus more on the physical blight and impacts on wildlife. There's limited discussion of bird and bat morality, especially the latter being a very serious problem (possibly not as well documented back when Green Illusions was written). He also doesn't mention the infrasound problem in the noise section.At one point he postulates about so-called NIMBYism being overcome but I think it will only get worse as the giant turbines multiply. We've already seen bans in many areas, e.g. Vermont trying to protect its mountain scenery.Anti-wind power arguments should focus on the obvious hypocrisy of massive, sprawling construction projects as the worst type of greenwashing. The economics are secondary in my view, but of course people care more about money than nature.I think solar has more potential than stated in this book, but the materials that go into it are definitely toxic.It's hard to be truly optimistic (as Zehner seems to be) about getting the masses to voluntary reduce consumption, though it's a goal to aim for. I'd have liked the book better if it was more candid about human nature and greed-based survival instincts. Cooperation among humans isn't nearly as altruistic as it may seem, except for rarer individuals.Random name error: ""George W. Bush..."" (RE advocating birth control) was actually George H.W. Bush, not his less-wise son.P.S. Reviewer Amber seems to totally miss the contextual link between over-consumption and the first part of the book, claiming that America should still have gluttony as a ""cultural"" option vs. Europe.

For example, it says green energy sources cannot be the answer because of their unacceptable side effects. Hydro power is no good because dams lead to international disputes. Solar is no good because the manufacture of solar panels causes pollution. Wind turbines are no good because they cause more pollution (in their manufacture) than they save over their lifetime. None of these assertions is substantiated unfortunately. So we just don't know how valid these assertions are. I suspect the author doesn't know either.

Reduced consumption is best way to reduce energy demands but harder to convince people. The prices of goods haven’t really reflected the negative side effects of the energy required to produce them. Taxation should shift away from income and focus more on consumption, which has worked well in California and Europe. The government should allow and enforce legally binding “No junk mail please”.

Yet, I personally consider the idea of the future of renewables is too pessimistic."
60,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4525376-nigel,4,I enjoyed this book & it makes some good points; but I didn't completely trust the facts it presents. It's very biased; one of those books that shoehorns everything towards the justification of its premise.A few of the theories I did look into were exaggerated or wrong. Jared Diamond's support of theory of ecological disaster for Easter island has already been discredited. The Newcastle Earthquake was not caused by mining. But the main point that alternate energies will not save us from ourselves is valid. 
61,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9274374-justin,5,"The truths that Ozzie Zehner lays bare about alternative energy sources in this book are a slap in the face for the mainstream environmental movement. I consider myself pretty in the know about the environment and what actions are most effective, but I can’t deny that I have swallowed the mass media’s version of our energy future, thinking that at any time there would be a huge breakthrough which will lower costs for solar or wind or electric batteries and that within a decade or two oil and coal would be pretty much superfluous. Now I understand that even if that technological breakthrough occurs, the manufacturing of all of the new batteries or solar panels would require enough fossil fuels to keep the industry in business as usual. Business as usual is our entire culture seeing “extreme energy waste as perfectly normal.”Here are some key quotes that really opened my eyes:“Solar cells, roof-mounted wind turbines, and geothermal heat systems cannot be solutions to the suburban cultural system because they offer no fundamental transformative power. High tech add-ons act to perpetuate the existing system, offering a bewitching promise of romantic utility even while delivering an uncalculated hypermediocrity of returns.” (pg. 275)“America has plenty of energy - more than twice as much as it needs. We just waste most of it. Established energy giants are willing to embrace alternative energy since it creates a convenient diversion from this simple reality. They understand that even if America were to, say, quadruple solar, wind, and biofuel output - a lofty project in itself - the increase would hardly impact fossil-fuel demand. I've spent enough time around these people to know this well. They’re laughing at us.” (pg. 303)We don’t need energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels so that we can continue our lifestyle. Rather, once we examine our lifestyle we will find that we would be much better off - happier, healthier - if we dramatically decrease our external energy consumption regardless of the energy source.Based on this basic premise, the book is a must read if these issues interest you. The first part of the book in which the author explores the future of every type of alternative energy you can think of and each one is as bleak as the last, especially if our goal is to perpetuate our current lifestyle. His analysis on this subject is unparalleled - fascinating, insightful and eminently readable.The second half of the book explores what the environmental movement should focus on to move toward a society that consumes less energy. His analysis here is sharp even if it is not as thorough as I expected. Although not nearly as insightful as the first part of the book, the second part does provide environmentalists with a powerful understanding of how to move forward.In general, this is an essential addition to the library of any environmentalist. It will give you insights into how our media portrays the environmentalist movement within a framework determined by the existing fossil fuel industry. "
62,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15630504-eric-li,5,"Fascinating way to look at environmentalism. Zehner starts off by giving the middle finger to all the so called environmentalists by going through each alternative energy source and saying why it sucks. For example, solar cells are wayyyy too expensive and not feasible to build on any large scale and prices have been flattening out. Also the area would have to be huge and people would come and steal it so there would need to be fences, guards, maintenance issues (need to scrub off the dust or else won't get as much sunlight), essentially skyrocketing their associated costs. Additionally production of solar panels generate harmful chemicals much worse than carbon dioxide. For wind, it's very unpleasant to people living around the turbines and is extremely loud and need lights to prevent planes from hitting it. It can also chop/distort radio, television, radar and aviation signals. The construction of these large turbines also have a huge carbon footprint and if there are other structures in the area it will choke airflow. And also it's extremely unpredictable, sometimes the wind just stops, so it can never be the main source of energy since there will always need to be a significant amount of backup. Anyways he goes through this and many other reasons for biofuels, nuclear power, hydrogen, clean coal and hydropower. He argues that the energy companies and politicians love these alternative energy sources because they don't actually do anything but they look sexy and people support them. So the oil companies know that they'll keep on being able to do their thing and the politicians can sleep safe knowing they have the environmentalists on their sides. Zehner does acknowledge that it is impossible in the future that technology can develop far enough but it is not anytime in the near future. So what are some of his solutions? Simple, nonsexy solutions. It is important to decrease consumption. The more energy we produce the more we will consume. He argues that women's rights should align with environmentalist concerns. The more access women have to birth control the better since our population is growing too quickly. Improving consumption, especially going after advertising to children, changing our culture of always needing to buy things, decrease junk mail and excess packaging and vegetarianism. Lastly changing the way our cities look, to make walkable cities, construct building smartly so there are passive ways to heat and cool buildings, plant more trees to provide shade instead of turning on the AC, and making it easier to bike. Anyways good book, convinced me to bike more, eat less meat and be more smug amongst alternative energy types and hybrid drivers which is the most important thing."
63,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14532417-ryan,4,"What happened to our promise of alternative energy and a better, greener future for America? Author Ozzie Zehner gives a critical and documented insight into the lies and false hopes that alternative energy goals have presented, especially as a platform for environmental good. Zehner demonstrates that it's not the prohibitive cost and limited technology involved in implementing solar cells, wind turbines and nuclear power (among other energy sources) that have stalled these alternatives from taking hold for decades, rather it's a false enduring promise propped by political and financial backers that these technologies will displace fossil fuels and provide clean sustainable power (both incorrect) that have forced them in our mindsets as the future of energy. The book is a wake-up call to any current and future environmentalists, urging them to cut ties to alternative energy, presenting it as an idea that is infinitely knotted to the current energy dream of creating ever more power while giving no guarantee that it will help cut back the current consumption of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases. If anything these implements will just append to our current energy usage in a system that is hellbent on more and more production. Rather than focusing on gadgetry and technology, Zehner calls for environmentalists to focus time and energy on social aspects of environmental structure, such as curbing unplanned pregnancies and supporting women's rights, stopping advertisements to children, eliminating physical junk mail and creating walkable communities, just to name a few. Enacting changes as mundane and feasible as these will have wide-reaching positive effects on both energy consumption and our idea of community, far more than alternative energy could ever hope to achieve.Though sometimes hokey (in his Nuclear-Military-Industrial Risk Complex chapter, a paragraph starts ""After a boom-boom here and a boom-boom there, fears grew that there might everywhere be a boom-boom."") and sometimes idealist, Zehner's skeptical approach to the current system of energy reform is striking and informative. A must-read for anyone interested in the future of energy and environmentalism."
64,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8069056-bart,4,"The opening half provides a very good overview of a range of ""green"" energy production technologies, such as photovoltaics, wind turbines, and biofuels. Zehner does a good job of highlighting the environmental hazards and drawbacks in all of these technologies. He also argues that there's no guarantee that adoption of any or all of these will reduce fossil fuel consumption; as history has shown, they many simply add to the total quantify of energy we consume, as we burn coal, oil AND solar panels.I found Zehner's frequent and sharp dismissal of ""productivists"" and ""productivism"" to be overly simplistic, and an unhelpful way of laying out his main point: that we need a society-wide, drastic reduction in our energy consumption, and until we do that, any green energy production methods will be band-aids at best and costly distractions at worst. (But once that's done, we'll still need some energy production, and I will be glad if there are a few ""productivists"" still busy at work.)The second half of the book dragged a bit for me. Zehner makes the very valid point that much or most of what is needed is not technological, and goes into a wide-ranging discussion of social changes that would result in major reduction in energy without reduction to the quality of life (or, often, with major improvements in quality of life). Some of these ideas are new and exciting to me, while others were old hat, but of course ""your mileage may vary""."
65,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8622936-harald-johansson,4,"I like how the book challenges my optimistic and perhaps arrogant view on technology as a solution for environmental issues (as in my review of ""Energy Myths and Realities"").I agree, action should be taken. I believe improved systems and regulations offer solutions, individuals can not be made solely accountable if change is to be made on a significant scale.The book is a bit too sceptic about future green technology and alternative sources for me to swallow it whole, and it doesn't go very deep into nuclear power.Also: interesting to have Sweden mentioned as a model country in a larger number of examples than we possibly deserve. Even though the author mentions true statements about swedish laws and regulations, we are certainly not as highly developed as perceived judging by the book. All developed countries should and must improve lots; we are far, far from ideal. It's not many years since Sweden had 13th place on WWF's list of ""Countries with the biggest ecological footprint"". That's something easily forgotten if we focus on how we handle our junk-mail."
66,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5812561-tomek,4,"Zehner does a very good job pointing out that 1.) all energy sources, including alternative energy sources, have deleterious environmental consequences; especially when they operate within a free market capitalist system, that 2.) to really reduce our energy footprint, environmentalists should focus not on alternative energy pipe dreams, but reasonable and pragmatic changes to our society (eg women's rights and walkable cities), and finally, that 3.) whatever we do, fossil fuels won't last forever and when they do run out, we will be forced to live a more sustainable, less energy-intensive lifestyle. My one critique is that only about 1/3 of the book actually deals with point 1. The vast majority is a rather cursory overview of point 2, which I feel is far better developed in books by Jensen and others."
67,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24203787-maria-d,5,"An absolute must-read for any person interested in environmental policy and especially in its energy part.While we are so sure that we'll be able to find a cheap energy source that will be able to sustain our unhealthy energy appetites - it may well be that it will never happen, and we'll have to sustain ourselves on a very modest energy diet. If we don't want that scenario cause massive protests that will wreak cross-continental havoc, we have to think about ways to survive on that diet - and while raising energy-efficient community is not the whole solution, it it definitely a step in the right way. Most of the suggestions of the book are sensible and some of them even achievable, and it definitely affected my views on how I see the current situation and first-priority environmental policy steps."

One of the most important books I've ever read, if not the most important, so I would highly recommend it. If you want to ask me more about it, please do. If I could get you to read any one book, this would be it."

Ozzie Zehner's main point is that alternative energy sources are not necessarily bad, but there are larger issues that need to be considered- first of all, consumption, but also income disparity, women's rights, universal healthcare, access to public transportation. Human rights issues and environmental issues are many times one in the same. "
70,0803237758,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30738137-simon,5,"The book presents a great argument why we can't rely on alternative-energy alone to create a sustainable future, but instead need to encourage social and political change as well.
