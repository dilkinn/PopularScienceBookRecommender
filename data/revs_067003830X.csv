0,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"When I saw this book initially I thought that I would have nothing but unequivocally good things to say about it. I am very fond of ‘brain’ books and prefer to believe that the mind is ‘plastic’ – that it can change itself or re-wire itself. I haven’t got much to pin this hope on. But hope is a good thing. However, in the end my response to this book has been much less black-and-white than I thought it would be.I’ve also just finished Fooled By Randomness. This has made me hypersensitive to any possibility that I might be getting fooled by any statistical aberrations. And, potentially, I saw statistical aberrations everywhere in this book. So much so that I was going to stop reading it and move onto something else a few times. But then he quoted an Indian doctor about the importance of individual case studies and I could see what he was doing.My concern with statistically valid results started when he was talking about internet pornography changing the structure of people’s brains to such an extent that they were existing on 2 – 3 hours sleep a night. Now, admittedly, I can’t remember the last time I talked to one of my male friends about how long they spend looking at internet porn – but this seemed quite excessive. The message was that internet porn is addictive, degenerative and destroys relationships.I worried that this sounded somewhat prudish. But prim or not, this wasn’t my main concern. I was more worried that these conclusions seemed to be based on the occasional bloke who strolled into this doctor’s waiting room. It seemed to me a bit of a jump to go from this group of self-selected ‘pornography addicts’ to saying that internet pornography is fundamentally changing our brains and of necessity making us desire violence as our ‘normal’ erotic stimulant of choice.The good bits of this book, though, were very good. There was a fascinating discussion on phantom hands and legs that amputees often have and how the often agonising pains in these phantom limbs are ‘cured’, quite literally, by magic. The discussion on how the centres in the brain that had once been devoted to the phantom limb and were then used by other parts of the body (sometimes with near catastrophic consequences) was truly fascinating. As was the discussion of the woman born with only the right side of her brain.The story of the woman at the start who was 'constantly falling' - a bit like Alice getting to Wonderland - was also another of those horror stories, I initially worried this book might end up. But also a fascinating story, all the same.There is a long and involved discussion of psychoanalysis that I again found rather hard to take. Case studies in psychoanalysis too often sound to me like remarkably simple-minded critiques of fairly badly written short stories written by a writer who has gone through the Women’s Weekly Dictionary of Literary Symbols to construct the storyline. Perhaps not ever cigar ends up being a penis, but every box seems to end up a coffin. I just find myself shaking my head reading this stuff and wishing it was all over.One of the things that Fooled By Randomness said in passing that caught my attention was that there is a difference between behavioural psychology and evolutionary psychology – but for his purposes these differences weren’t very important. I’m not really much of one for psychology. It tends to be a subject people who have studied philosophy look down on rather unfairly. But this book stands quite opposed to – say – Steven Pinker’s various books on how our minds are made and work. Pinker is one of Noam Chomsky’s followers – at least in linguistics and in his oft repeated idea that we are not born with a mind that is a blank slate.I’ve said this before, and am going to say it again now; people often ask how Chomsky’s politics and linguistics fit together and to me they don’t fit at all. I would expect that someone with strong left-wing ideas would tend towards a belief that the oppressive structures that exist in society are able to be changed. This would seem to be undermined by ideas that – with Kant – say that many of our ‘faculties’ are innate or (in more up-to-date language) are genetically pre-programmed. But this does seem to be what Chomsky’s Linguistics implies – that we have evolved linguistic structures in the brain that allow the rapid and ‘effortless’ learning of language. This book quotes Edelman’s work – I once started his Bright Light, Brilliant Fire but found it remarkably hard going. Edelman had a Darwinian view of how the brain developed – a view I once heard Chomsky criticise. I didn’t understand why Chomsky was quite so worked up about it at the time, but after finishing this I’ve a better idea. One of the key ideas for Edelman is that the brain must be very plastic – because very, very many neurons die and they do so quite at random. So, evolution can’t rely on precise circuits being laid down by our genes alone. Rather, brains are plastic enough so that they can learn from their environment and then respond to that. But this is the point that both Pinker and Chomsky seem determined to criticise if not refute.There are many aspects of Pinker’s ideas that I particularly like. There are also many parts of this work that I find simple-minded and annoying. But, if you were to draw a line with Pinker on one end and this guy on the other, where would I put my cross? Closer to Pinker? I really couldn’t say.All the same, even if this guy is completely wrong, and we really can’t change brain structures once they have been laid down, it is probably better to believe he is right. His near constant message is, if you don’t use it you will lose it. He repeatedly points to experiments in which well exercised brains prove to be heavier and their neurons prove to be richer in interconnections – you can literally think yourself smarter. He claims using your brain and continuously learning is one of the best ways to avoid Alzheimer’s Disease – and I do think that is probably one disease well worth avoiding.So, would I recommend this book? It is hard to say. I wouldn’t say I learnt nothing from it – but there were things about it that annoyed me. As I said, when it was good, it was very, very good. It is just that there was this curl, right in the middle of its forehead and that was the problem. "
1,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68300-rebecca,3,"So far this book has taught me two things. 1. That I am far more affected than I expected to be by the phrase ""sew a kitten's eyelid closed for three weeks..after which the kitten remained permanently blind in one eye."" and2. Using the word ""till"" instead of ""until"" is acceptable in scholarly writing. For the rest of the information, stay tuned. Okay, so I finished the book. It was a fulfilling emotional rollercoaster for the chronically impressionable and acutely anxious. Every chapter presented some new physical calamity that might any day befall me and then a lot of new work about state-of-the-art-medical-attention-aided recovery. Leaving me, at the end of each chapter, feeling a little more indestructible.In other news, the books was quick and accessible to Humanity Heads and even Grammar Faces who have a little mental science sizzle every time the word polymerase is used in a sentence. It had my full attention until I got to the chapter on Handsome Henry and ""sexual preference"" when I got too angry to continue. I skimmed and skipped and then read the rest of the book in full. The parts where the author talked about reversing the deterioration of the brain caused by aging and the ability of psychotherapy to change the brain were especially interesting to me... even if they were second fiddle to all things more miraculous. "
2,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"Content note: discusses some examples you may interpret as animal cruelty.I have pretty mixed feelings about this book. My main response, I guess, is ""read with caution"". There are some parts which are reasonable, well-founded, and which don't seem to be driven by any bias. Talking about the ways to help people recover from strokes would fall under this category; I was actually a bit surprised that all of the information about brain maps, and the brain's ""use it or lose it"" approach to neuronal real estate, was actually considered surprising or controversial. I thought that aspect of neurobiology was fairly clear to people in this day and age. Certainly, the idea that you can expand areas of your brain by using them, and lose abilities by not practicing them, seemed to me obvious. The book was written in 2007, so I expected an understanding brain plasticity to be the norm, not the underdog.It's when Doidge got onto other topics that I started to feel uncomfortable. Googling around a bit showed that Fast ForWord isn't universally acclaimed, as I'm sure it would be if the results were as unequivocal as Doidge presents them. Just hitting Wikipedia shows some doubt about the experiments -- the ones with clear positive results were conducted by biased people and weren't subjected to double-blind methods.Then I got to the chapter on ""sexual perversions"". Sexual perversion, to Doidge, basically seems to be anything he doesn't personally like. People with kinks or fetishes are not just different, but sick, in his analysis. And it's usually their parents' fault -- or porn. It's not just individual difference, but something which must be corrected. Homogeneity for all.(I really wonder what he'd think about my total disinterest in a) sex and b) other people's taboos about sex. If you're not doing anything to anyone that they don't want and haven't asked for, go ahead. Enthusiastic consent obtained? None of my business anymore, if it ever was. Sure, a lot of it makes no sense to me and has no appeal, but nor does skateboarding or bungee jumping.)He just seems to have a problem with difference in general. If your brain isn't wired the way other people's brains are wired, you've got to fix it.This did make his chapter on OCD and related problems interesting to me (see also my mental health awareness post on Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Me). I don't have any particular arguments with his way of describing OCD and the treatment thereof: I recognise those obsessive behaviours, the things that were unhelpful in trying to reverse them, and the things that actually did help. He criticises CBT in a way that entirely makes sense to me, pointing out that by focusing on the intrusive thought, you can get it more firmly entrenched in your mind. This was a very short chapter, though.Then there's a lot of stuff about experiments on animals, which is where I gave up on this guy. I'm not automatically against animal experimentation, when limited, tightly controlled, and cleared or at least discussed with an ethics board. I find it hard, though, to see the value in cutting all the sensory nerves in both a monkey's arms and then sticking a probe into its brain to measure responses there. I find it especially hard to cope with a narrative where this is so matter of fact that there is no mention of ethical concerns at all -- except to complain that they got in the way of science. PETA are often crackpots, I think they might have had a point here, though.So if you do read this, read it with caution, attention to the notes, reference to outside sources and studies. Be prepared for very dispassionate recountings of some pretty awful experiments. (Sure, let's sew a kitten's eye shut for the first weeks of its life, to prove that it can then never process sight with that eye again. It's not like we could do that experiment just by looking historically at children with cataracts. Oh, wait.) Be prepared for the fact that this guy is in no way neutral.The sad thing is, I find the idea of brain plasticity utterly fascinating; some of this book is great. Some of it just... isn't, and I'm sure there must be a better book out there with a bit less of the author's personal feelings directing the text."
3,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/573386-mike,5,"This book is about the plasticity of the brain. That is versus ""Localizationism"" which holds that the brain is static and each part performs only one function. Modern science, thru the use of MRI, Catscan and observed recoveries of function loss have disproved the long-held notion of localizationism. The book is really a set of stories about people who have regained or developed senses they either lost or never had. The stories are quite inspiring. For example, one man had a stroke and lost the use of his left side. He will himself, on the floor, around his house for a year and retrained another part of his brain to direct his left side and fully recovered. Other stroke victims can now receive plasticity therapy to regain lost motor functions.Phantom limb pain in amputees can be stopped with mirrors. There are many other stories of personal triumph. I got the book when I purchased some software to excerise my brain. The excercises are based on plasticity. I have gotten to the point where the exercises are getting difficult. We'll see if it can help an old man.P.S. there are some animal testing stories in the book that made me a little quesy. "
4,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,2,"Oliver Sacks, he ain't. Despite the back cover blurb from Oliver Sacks, this is definitely a lesser book. There are some interesting things in here, and may be worth a read, even though there was one chapter that I thought was just terrible. But don't go looking here for Sacks' deep humanism and warmth. This is much more the distant case history, although the science he's talking about is fascinating. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook"
5,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,4,"The big idea of the book is the concept of plasticity and how the brain deals with learning and changing multiple skills. In a nutshell each brain function is ""fighting"" for limited resources, there's only so much mapping space available and what you work on the most gets developed. ""Use it or lose it."" Whatever you don't cultivate, over time you will lose, including ability to: cultivate multiple skills, generate new ideas, stay focused, math/science skills, learning a new language, playing an instrument. If you don't act now it just gets harder and harder to do more stuff. As we age the common brain functions get deeper mapping and it gets extremely hard to build new habits because the limited space is already taken by the old ones. What this means is that you need to start cultivating the right habits and skills RIGHT NOW!To conclude we must realize that unlearning is a lot harder than learning because every repetition of that old habit made it stronger. So it's not just about adding, it's about pro-actively removing all the bad shit from your life. This is really a great book, I learned a lot from reading it and I would recommend you to check it out!"
6,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"travelling mp3, new car and an open road...Description: An astonishing new science called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they've transformed people whose mental limitations or brain damage were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.Doidge is not a man you would want to invite for dinner as he has no humanity. MANY animals were harmed in the making of book, sickeningly so, and on many occasions seemed to me, unnecessary numbers. Overkill on overkill just for the sake of proving what we all intuitively know already 'Use it or Lose it'.There is an upside, I went into this book a chronically diseased woman and now am convinced I am indestructable - it's a bloody miracle.Experiments aside, this book about brain plasticity is unputdownable, and whilst I would not recommend it on for fear of offending, The Brain That Changes Itself had me in its thrall: it all made perfect sense. 3.5*"
7,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16030-marion,5,"This book was absolutely fascinating. I have always been intrigued by how the brain works and, even though I am not a ""science"" person, I found this book easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable.The book is about the recent notion that the brain is ""plastic,"" or malleable. Our brain has the ability to change - through learning, through experience, through our thoughts. It was once thought that the brain was ""hardwired,"" and that certain parts of the brain performed specific tasks and that if those parts died, the person was incapable of performing these tasks. But scientists have proven that, when brain cells are killed, the brain has the capacity to reorganize itself to accomplish tasks. The impact: stroke victims who are paralyzed can recover some mobility, people with OCD can recognize that it's their brain that is causing their stress and can choose actions to help their brain reorganize, senior citizens can perform the right types of activities to stimulate new growth (we're not talking doing crossword puzzles - we mean learning new tasks), children with learning disorders can strengthen the ""weak"" parts of their brain. The discoveries and experiments depicted in this book are changing the way we view the brain and will impact the way we live. "
8,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"A truly fascinating, accessible book about the plasticity of the brain. Most interesting to me were the clever approaches that some psychologists invented, for solving or mediating various mental/physical problems. Although this book is not of the ""self-help"" variety, it contains a number of approaches that have been used for improving brain functioning."
9,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234758-lily,4,"This book was a very interesting read. I found it to be a pretty ""light"" read, in that the science mumbo-jumbo had been effectively translated into English. But that doesn't mean Doidge's claims are unsupported--throughout the text, and in extensive notes, he cites published research results, giving the book plenty of credibility.The Brain that Changes Itself discusses the (apparently controversial) subject of neuroplasticity. Although many of its claims seem perfectly intuitive (through mental and physical exercise, we can shape our brains being the main one), the results are often surprising. This book made me more motivated to get off my duff, try new things, and exercise my brain. I recommend it to anyone with some gray matter in their head.I will admit, there was one chapter I didn't particularly care for. Towards the end, Doidge seems to rely more on case studies, and case studies only, than on theoretical experiments. But I found that he presented the information clearly enough, not masking the sources of his conclusions, that I could easily pick through the words and find what I believed to be true."
10,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, The good book explains the discovery of neuroplasticity in recent years. The brain can change itself a lot more than we used to think. It is more plastic and can shift function to other areas when damaged and learn new skills and permanently change its wiring. I thought the section on sexual imprinting was interesting. Early sexual experiences can show up in lifelong preferences in males in terms of what they are influenced to find desirable in a mate. Lots of other tidbits that show that things can be learned throughout the lifespan and there is hope for people to recover function after brain damage.
11,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1893001-merilee,4,"This book was amazing. Not a real page-turner, but a fascinating look at the brain's ability to rewire itself and grow/change beyond our expectation.Praise the Lord who made our brains so complex and adept at fulfilling their purpose!I especially liked the chapters that dealt with autism, and overcoming disabilities. If you are interested in neuroplasticity, brain maps, or just want some ideas about keeping your brain in shape as you age - you may want to read this book.(I didn't particularly like the chapter 4 - it dealt with the brain's role in adapting sexual attraction, and got a bit graphic for me. But that chapter could be skipped over and the message of the book would still be intact.) "
12,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,4,"The Brain that Slowly Changes Itself, If You Work Really Hard at ItIt was once thought that the brain was a complex machine, with each part performing a single dedicated function. If a part broke you lost that function. This book is about “brain plasticity”, the concept that the brain can change the way it functions. For example, if one goes blind the part of the brain responsible for sight may be re-wired to improve the sense of hearing or touch. As Doidge puts it: “There is an endless war of nerves going on inside each of our brains. If we stop exercising our mental skills, the brain map for those skills is turned over for something else. Brain maps are governed by competition for precious resources and the principle of use it or lose it.”Doidge’s books are known mainly for giving hope to those who have suffered brain injuries such as strokes. A typical case study is about a man who suffered a severe stroke that left him mostly paralyzed, with little hope for recovery. Observing that he seemed like a baby, his son spent the next year having his father follow the same process a baby uses to learn to walk. His father was eventually able to resume his hobby of walking in the mountains.Before we talk about miracle cures, it is critical to note that the “plastic” is very stiff and resistant to change, and it takes months or years to adapt a part of the brain to a different purpose. The patient must do a vast amount of work over a long time. Doidge claims the reason traditional physiotherapy often fails is because they give up if there is no progress after a few months, which is not long enough.I think the most interesting parts of the book are related to Doidge’s perspective as a psychoanalyst. He suggests that all learning and experience is about wiring the brain. Consider the amount of time and repetition required to learn to speak, read, or play a musical instrument. Brain dis-function, or neurosis, is acquired the same way, by the repetition of negative experiences. The purpose of talk therapy is help the patient re-wire the brain to produce a better outcome. Given the amount of brain “stiffness”, no amount of therapy will be sufficient unless the patient takes on the responsibility to constantly challenge and correct the malfunctioning circuits. Re-Wiring EducationThis book directly challenges the modern educational practice of “compensation”, which is to avoid any activity that is difficult for the student, and instead find a way to work around it. A learning disability can be seen as poorly functioning brain path. Doidge provides us with several case studies where intensive therapy was able to correct this kind of problem. Interestingly, this sometimes led to other learning problems also being resolved, as though a missing piece in the puzzle had been restored. The message is that it may be better to address the cause of learning problems rather than trying to avoid them. He reminds us, “Traditional education recognized that children’s brains had to be built up through exercises of increasing difficulty that strengthened brain functions. A classical education included rote memorization of long poems in foreign languages, which strengthened the auditory memory (hence thinking in language) and an almost fanatical attention to handwriting, which helped strengthened motor capacities and added speed and fluency to reading and speaking.”There is no single educational model that can work for everybody, but some the methods of the past that we have abandoned may have worked well for some students.The Pornography Disaster“Human beings exhibit an extraordinary degree of sexual plasticity compared with other creatures. No other instinct can so satisfy without accomplishing its biological purpose, and no other instinct is so disconnected from that purpose.”A now ubiquitous instructional program to disconnect sexuality from its purpose is called pornography. In his words, “Hard-core porn unmasks some of the early neural networks that formed in the critical periods of sexual development and brings all these early, forgotten, or repressed elements together to form a new network, in which all the features are wired together. He has created a kind of 'neosexuality', a rebuilt libido that has strong roots in his buried sexual tendencies.”Frequently repeated attempts to attain pleasure lead to addiction, which involves long-term neuroplastic changes in the brain. As he puts it, “The men at their computers looking at porn are uncannily like experimental rats in cages, pressing the bar to get a shot of dopamine.” He should know, as part of his practice is trying to rehabilitate these victims. They come to him because they are attracted to an impossible fantasy, and can no longer find their real life partner sexually attractive.It is left unsaid that there are other victims of pornography, which depicts women in a perverted and degrading form. Why is there a wall of silence around this subject, especially from so-called feminists?Well Worth ReadingI found this book well worth reading. It challenges some of the assumptions of both medicine and education. One concept never mentioned in the book is cost. Time is money, and changing our stiff-plastic brains is very time consuming. Reading his therapy case studies, with people working all day, every day for months and years, I could not help wondering who was going to get the bill? Can we as a society afford to do this for everybody who could potentially be helped?I have good reason to be suspicious of any popular book that makes claims about healing. However, a search through critical expert reviews turned up nothing that specifically debunks what he is saying. A morally bankrupt objection came from a doctor who feared his patients would feel guilty if they learn their condition can be improved through hard work! The content is in line with what I am learning elsewhere about neurobiology. Therefore I consider the book to be credible.Don’t skip the last two chapters, called appendices, which put his findings of individual brain plasticity into a social context. He reminds us, “Civilization is a set of techniques to rewire the brain. But civilization is only one generation deep.” Indeed."
13,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37541875-beth,4,"We can alter the structure of our brains, at will, by the way we behave and think. This radical truth entered mainstream neuroscience about 30 years ago, finally shattering the earlier belief in fixed regions of the brain.“Neurons that fire together wire together.” If repeated, the connections get stronger. Unused connections wither away – use it or lose it. Therein lies what Doidge calls the ‘Plastic Paradox’. With commitment, we can expand our brains by learning new skills, at any age, and open up the quality of our lives. Without this, the brain will wire existing habits and thought patterns more tightly into ever deepening ruts producing rigid thinking and narrow lives that are hard to change. Nothing is fixed. Everything is up for grabs. Cultural and religious beliefs, sexual predilections, the sources of depression and anxiety, and much more, are all post-natal wiring that can, in theory, be disentangled and rewired. And the brain’s ability to find neuronal rat-runs, or create new ones, in response to injury (including stroke) is staggering, admittedly with much effort.The brain reshapes in response to sustained, focused attention on something new. Skills that have cognitive and physical elements - learning a musical instrument, dancing, drawing – are especially potent, as are skills that combine the senses such as learning a new language. GoodReaders will be gratified to learn that intense reading of new material also makes the grade. Novelty is indispensible. Good general health is critical, especially sufficient sleep when new skills are wired and memories embedded. Regular exercise encourages the growth of new neurons from stem cells; alcohol does not. The brain’s blood supply is protected by a healthy diet and not smoking. No surprises here.My attention was drawn to reducing the risks of dementia, though the book has a far wider reach than this. It is fascinating that we can alter the structure of our brains as we can alter the shape of our bodies through exercise, and glean such huge benefits as a result. It is no surprise that people who are educated (in the broadest sense) and who continue to explore new cognitive territory are less prone to dementia than those who sink into passive comfort zones.This book was quite a challenging read and assumed some knowledge of neuro-anatomy in the reader. The content is so fascinating, however, that it more than compensates for the rather heavy writing."
14,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Neuroplasticity as a double-edged sword can cause flexibility or rigidity to the brain tissues. Neurons in the brain connect themselves as you use them. Each brain function is competing for limited resources and there is limited mapping space. So, what you have worked on the most gets developed. It's similar to physical exercise, the more you practice it in a certain way, the more you will get flexible in certain body parts resulting in more automaticity and the reduction of resources necessary to complete a specific move/task. Conversely, if you don't exercise, you will get overwhelmed and trapped with the same cycle of procrastinating exercise. Furthermore, unlearning is a lot harder than learning in a similar way because every repetition of that old habit made it stronger to change further.Now, the brain's ability to change depends on learning through experience( outside stimulants, turning on some genes in catalyst environments...).So, the concept that the certain brain parts were ""hardwired"" to perform specific tasks were overthrown by its capacity to deny the death of those brain cells( it can simply rewire to accomplish tasks ).The book was so lucid and well consuming but I don't want to have dinner with Norman Doidge for a personal reason( emotional ok? :P ). He described all those experiments on those poor animals such as rats, monkeys, kitten ... in a zombie mode :(. There is another reason, his attitude seems like "" If your brain doesn't work like a so-called functional brain then there is something wrong with your brain, so you have to get better with outside stimulants "" ( Pardon me, If I misunderstood him ... and I'm open to reread him again :) )The concept of ""change"" itself is a fascinating, open path to be promoted/encouraged but when the ethic propaganda ""change is for good/bad/better/worse"" is promoted to control diversity forcefully then it goes really sickening.But, as a human, I'm full of cognitive dissonances ( :P), so I put 4/5 into my satisfaction level. Because in this case, my left hemisphere reasoning had won the battle against my emotional turndown reasons. :)"
15,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12644819-amy,5,"This is a must-read for anyone in healthcare. An interesting and important read for everyone else. Cleverly done - he takes real stories about people who have changed their brains, the way they move, communicate, think, act, etc., and discusses the science behind it. He does this in an easy, fascinating way. Another interesting aspect is his discussion on the history behind neuroplasticity. We have known for years that our brain can change. When I became a nurse we were taught that your brain is the way it is. When you have a stroke, you are done. If you are born with a deformity or disability, you are incapable of improvements. I'M PROUD TO SAY THIS IS NOT TRUE! I never believed people couldn't change. It simply didn't make sense. I would watch people learn to walk again after a major stroke. This is not a self-help how-to type book. However, if you need encouragement to change in ANY WAY, this will do just that. This is a book discussing plasticity, and how real it is.A++"
16,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,4,"Conservatives are an especially fear-prone group. In a 2008 paper in the journal Science, researchers subjected a group of adults with strong political beliefs to a set of startling noises and graphic images. Those with the strongest physical reactions were more likely to support capital punishment, defense spending and the war in Iraq. A 2011 paper in the journal Cell found a correlation between conservative leanings and the size of the right amygdala, the portion of the brain that processes emotions in response to fearful stimuli. In her book Irony and Outrage, University of Delaware professor Dannagal Young points out that liberals and conservatives respond differently to entertainment rhetoric: Liberals have a higher tolerance for open-ended ambiguity, while conservatives look for closure and want problems to be solved."
17,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"As scientists have learned more about the brain, they've come to reject the idea that it is a fixed hardwired machine as previously thought, but instead a malleable and flexible structure that can change throughout our lifespan in ways that we are only just beginning to appreciate.Each chapter in The Brain That Changes Itself deals with a theme that explores the plastic nature of the brain and an individual story that highlights that particular theme. From treating stroke victims to those suffering from learning disabilities or struggling to recover from psychological trauma to those looking to protect themselves against or reverse mental decline and dementia, understanding the plastic and restorative nature of the brain offers new hope and options in achieving brain health and better quality of life for many who had little to no hope before. Like any emerging science, the ""research"" has to be taken at face value. Yet I think this book does a good job of introducing the changing attitudes about the brain, how it works, and what those new attitudes mean from a clinical perspective. At times, some chapters sounded like infomercials for a particular treatment/technique, though I think this was simply enthusiasm on the author's part, perhaps to honor the men and women who contributed to this book.Obviously we haven't figured the brain out, but with each new discovery we find another small piece of the puzzle and Doidge did a good job of introducing the concept of neuroplasticity, how we got there scientifically, and its implications.Some of the reviews I read found fault with the chapter on sex, which talked about the addictive side of pornography among other things. I personally didn't find it offensive or prudish, and it was consistent with other things I have read. At the very minimum, Doidge makes some valid points, although this particular chapter felt more biased than the others and seemed to be less cohesive in terms of its overall presentation.I also enjoyed the Appendixes which delved into the social implications of brain plasticity. For example, genetics influences brain development which influences culture, but culture can also influence the structure of the brain. Furthermore, the malleable nature of the brain can have negative consequences and those are briefly explored.Bottom line, a good read that I would recommend to those interested in brain science, specifically the plastic nature of the brain and the practical implications."
18,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"The book is about neuroplasticity: the idea that our thoughts and experiences can rewire and change the structure of our brains. This may sound like a revolutionary idea in an age when too many people talk about a brain hardwired by our genes, and the author certainly dramatizes this point and wants to portray his book as representing a novel and ground-breaking idea, but somehow what the book says didn’t come across to me as revolutionary as it claims. Maybe because I’ve already read Ramachandran and was familiar with some of these “neuroplasticity” ideas? I don’t know. Some ideas in this book are common sense and common knowledge, like avoiding Alzheimer’s disease in the old age by living a life of intense mental activity. The author seems to have ignored the basic rule of science that you cannot make general claims based on some individual cases. I blame that on his being a psychoanalyst. His long chapter on neuroplasticity providing a scientific explanation for psychoanalysis (aren’t psychoanalysts sore about being snubbed by hard scientists!) left me scratching my head. Some inveterate and hardened middle-aged man named Mr. L. finally breaks down after long sessions of analysis and cries, I want my mommy. I wondered what that had to do with neuroplasticity. The chapter on love, sex, and pornography (what a trio) makes all sorts of over-generalized claims. There are parts of the book that sound like a sales pitch for the products of companies that are doing research in neuroplasticity. However, there are also a few fascinating stories in the book that show a radical restructuring of the brain when individuals are subjected to drastically different life experiences or stimulating brain exercise programs."
19,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377186-dawn,5,"I found this book so inspiring. As a psychiatrist, not much of the subject matter was new, but Doige has compiled decades of research into a readable book about how amazing and adaptable the brain is. I must say that it has really made me think not only about how neuroplasticity affects my clinical practice, but also how it influences myself, my children and my family. "
20,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7437132-gail,4,"I really wasn't sure how to rate this book as I don't usually read non-fiction. It was remarkably easy to read and understand, well set out with a lot of supportive evidence. It documented the development of the theory of brain plasticity. How various people had played with the idea over time, gaining little or no support. To down right stonings. That last bit might be a slight exaggeration. :). The topics touched on were fascinating. Mid book I got a little concerned about some areas covered and started reading reviews so I could understand how to interpret the information provided. That helped a lot. What I am going to do now is: get out there, do a bit of exercise to help grow a few neurons; exercise my brain wildly so I don't lose any. Then I am going to cross my fingers and hope it really can help me resist Alzheimers. EDIT:I was very excited to find out Friday, that the organisation I work for has a programme in place to test the theory of re-wiring the brain. One of the topics written about in this book.12 children with learning difficulties have been sellected to trial the programme. I am so pleased to be part of an organisation that is able and willing to trial something like this. If these children can have their brains re mapped, wow! That is all I have to say!"

22,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"I read this book in three different positions and each position in a particular angle to the screen. The interesting thing I noticed is that when I changed the usual angle, I was having more struggle to track down the lines and the content and a following significant change in the pace. Over the course of reading, I could see an improvement in reading in different angles which was pretty much proportional to the content of this book, Plasticity. Brain plasticity is truly a gift, which allows us to adapt to a vast range of environments. How fundamentally training shapes and rewires brain is presented in several accounts and in different frames in this book. How neurons and different brain parts operating to shape certain plastic changes are very insightful and interesting facts about the underlying process of our brains. Plasticity vs localizationism: Plasticity is an almost new field which revolutionized neuroscience and went directly against the localizationism and the notion of hardwired brains. Therefore plasticity is a science that proves not only brain is not like a hardwired structure of circuits, but also it can be rewired over time provided by numerous experimental cases by pioneers of the science of plasticity like Paul Bach-y-Rita, Merzenich, Ramachandran, Schwartz, Pascual-Leone, and etc. Neuroplastic research has shown us that every sustained activity ever mapped—including physical activities, sensory activities, learning, thinking, and imagining—changes the brain as well as the mind. Plasticity and rewiring: Many tastes we think “natural” are acquired through learning and become “second nature” to us. We are unable to distinguish our “second nature” from our “original nature” because our neuroplastic brains, once rewired, develop a new nature, every bit as biological as our original.Plasticity and Unlearning: The science of unlearning is a very new one. Because plasticity is competitive, when a person develops a neural network, it becomes efficient and self-sustaining and, like a habit, hard to unlearn.Different chemistries are involved in learning than in unlearning. When we learn something new, neurons fire together and wire together, and a chemical process occurs at the neuronal level called “long-term potentiation,” or LTP, which strengthens the connections between the neurons. When the brain unlearns associations and disconnects neurons, another chemical process occurs, called “long-term depression,” or LTD (which has nothing to do with a depressed mood state). Unlearning and weakening connections between neurons is just as plastic a process, and just as important, as learning and strengthening them. If we only strengthened connections, our neuronal networks would get saturated. Evidence suggests that unlearning existing memories is necessary to make room for new memories in our networks.Plasticity and OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder): Schwartz set out to develop a treatment that would change the OCD circuit by unlocking the link between the orbital cortex and the cingulate and normalizing the functioning of the caudate. Schwartz wondered whether patients could shift the caudate “manually” by paying constant, effortful attention and actively focusing on something besides the worry, such as a new, pleasurable activity. This approach makes plastic sense because it “grows” a new brain circuit that gives pleasure and triggers dopamine release which, as we have seen, rewards the new activity and consolidates and grows new neuronal connections. This new circuit can eventually compete with the older one, and according to use it or lose it, the pathological networks will weaken. With this treatment we don’t so much “break” bad habits as replace bad behaviors with better ones.Plasticity and Pain: Ramachandran developed the idea that pain is a complex system under the plastic brain’s control. He summed this up as follows: “Pain is an opinion on the organism’s state of health rather than a mere reflexive response to injury.” The brain gathers evidence from many sources before triggering pain. He has also said that “pain is an illusion” and that “our mind is a virtual reality machine,” which experiences the world indirectly and processes it at one remove, constructing a model in our head. So pain, like the body image, is a construct of our brain. Plasticity and Imagination: Whats several “imaginary” experiments show is how truly integrated imagination and action are, despite the fact that we tend to think of imagination and action as completely different and subject to different rules. But consider this: in some cases, the faster you can imagine something, the faster you can do it. Jean Decety of Lyon, France, has done different versions of a simple experiment. When you time how long it takes to imagine writing your name with your “good hand,” and then actually write it, the times will be similar. When you imagine writing your name with your nondominant hand, it will take longer both to imagine it and to write it. Most people who are right-handed find that their “mental left hand” is slower than their “mental right hand.” In studies of patients with stroke or Parkinson’s disease (which causes people’s movements to slow), Decety observed that patients took longer to imagine moving the affected limb than the unaffected one. Both mental imagery and actions are thought to be slowed because they both are products of the same motor program in the brain. The speed with which we imagine is probably constrained by the neuronal firing rate of our motor programs."
23,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,4,"A fascinating book about the malleability of the brain. The author presents a variety of case studies that show that an individual's mind can fix what is wrong with the brain. This is down to the idea that the brain has a plasticity with the capability to heal and alter at any time during a person's life. Examples are patients with phantom limb pain, OCD sufferers, blindness, pain management etc. who all benefited from a neuroplastic therapeutic approach to improve their condition. It's an inspiring account to think that the way we 'use' our brains can be crucial in either change toxic behaviour patterns or if left untreated embed them further as a fixed brain pathway that can cause chronic conditions. It's a thought-provoking read and worth a detour if all else seems to fail!"
24,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,4,"This is an absolutely fascinating book about how neurologists have discovered in the past thirty years or so that the human brain is much, much more resilient and plastic than it was believed to be for a long time. Neurologists used to think that everyone's brain map was basically the same, with functions like sight or hearing in pretty much the same place, and that if those sections of the brain were damaged, then the function they controlled would be permanently impaired. This didn't explain, however, people who were born with sections of their brain missing, yet still were able to live normal or almost normal lives, nor did it explain why some people who suffered strokes were able to regain skills that should have been lost forever. Doige profiles some of the most innovative neurologists in the field, and discusses case histories of individuals who exemplify the brain's plasticity.There was only one section of the book where I felt Doige was dodging some issues. In the chapter on sexuality, he discusses the role that neuroplasticity might feature in the case of fetishes or addiction to pornography. He stops short, however, of the risky topic of what neuroplasticity might mean in the case of sexual orientation. I understand that this is a controversial topic and that he (and other researchers) might want to avoid it, but it struck me as rather disengenuous to gloss over it completely."

26,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143789-lcbogota,5,"This book made me reexamine what I believed about human behavior, in particular our ability to change. The author refers to neuroscience and brain studies to argue that every time we engage in a behavior, we create or reinforce pathways in our brain. Intuitively we know that the more you practice a skill, the better you get at it. The better you get at something, the less effort it takes. Brain scans demonstrate this process. The concept is known as brain plasticity, which means the brain's ability to adapt and change. The technical explanation for this process is summarized in Hebb's law: ""Neurons that fire together, wire together."" I was surprised to find that Sigmund Freud --who started out as a neurologist before getting into psychoanalysis-- had proposed something very similar. In 1888, Freud stated that when two neurons fire simultaneously, this firing facilitates their ongoing association. This was the notion behind Freud's idea of free association: the concept that seemingly random pairings of words in fact have a neurological basis. Author Norman Doidge argues that the same process of reinforcing neuron connections that allows the brain to change, is also responsible for the creation of behavioral rigidity: The more we engage in a certain behavior, the more entrenched that behavior becomes. As such, the same process that is responsible for our ability to adapt and change can also makes us more rigid and inflexible. This challenges the notion that we are ""hardwired"" for certain characteristics or behaviors, and suggests that human behavior is not predestined and inevitable.The other side of the coin would be the school of thought that favors the notion of genetic predisposition, and questions whether human nature contains innate characteristics, personal inclination or tendencies. Doidge does not address these issues. The book does not present plasticity as a panacea, and it directly cautions against the notion of human perfectibility (perfectibilité, Jean-Jacques Rousseau), but it does offer optimism concerning the brain's ability to adapt, and it looks at how this can be put to practical use. Uses of plasticity:Therapy for stroke victims who were previously thought beyond help.Retraining for balance problems.Sight and hearing for the blind/deaf.Therapy for people with learning disabilities.Training the older brain to keep it in shape.PsychotherapyFor dealing with behaviors that we want to change.Aim of therapy when dealing with incidents from the critical period of early life is to make these explicit and retranscribe them as a conscious language-based memory.The ChallengeThe author challenges us to look at our own behavior and ask the question: ""Am I doing this because it is the best thing to be doing now, or am I doing this because it is what I tend to do in this situation?""Never again will I say: That's just the way I am, it's in my nature. Rather I now look at my behavior and say: This is what I choose to do. This is what I choose to be."
27,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"The Brain that Changes Itself is nominally about neuroplasticity and our growing understanding of it, but if you like your pop sci to have its emphasis on the sci rather than the pop, it's probably not the best book for you to be reading.It's important to keep in mind that the subtitle is ``Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science''; the main purpose of it is not to inform, but to make you feel good about what the human body can do. And unsurprisingly, a lot of the time the thing that is triumphed over is not just a disability, but also the (as usual largely imaginary) derision and ossification of the Scientific Establishment, which gets incredibly old really quickly.Doidge does hint at the downsides of neuroplasticity, mostly using the predictable example—porn addiction. He happily parrots Freud and pulls a whole lot of bullshit about the decline of modern society out of his ass, demonstrating once again why, exactly, only psychologists think psychologists are scientists. For all the sensitivity displayed about physical disabilities, retardation, and idiocy, he certainly has no qualms about denouncing perfectly innocent fetishes as ``perversion''.So it's science in much the same way that science journalism is, nowadays. While there are important insights to be had here, he spends too much time focussing on the human interest side of things, and grossly overstating how controversial neuroplasticity is. It's definitely one of those books that would have been great if it had been written by a scientist, but as it is, it's barely a few steps above day-time television.(The appendices, incidentally, are even worse than the main body, and an important reason my rating is so low. The first, The Culturally Modified Brain, is guilty of the worst excesses of evolutionary psychology as she is practised, with a healthy dose of cultural condescension thrown in. The second, Plasticity and the Idea of Progress, tries to attribute the concept of neuroplasticity to everyone from Rousseau to Thomas Jefferson. This is the same impulse that credits Democritus with modern atomic theory and Jesus the Buddha with Marxism, and I will never understand it.)"
28,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,4,"At least for me, a large portion of my upbringing in anatomy, physiology, and psychology at University lead me to the conclusion that different areas of the brain are hardwired for different things and that from there on out it is pretty much just simon says. Because I knew little about the plasticity of the brain, or much of the notion that this is how the brain worked I think the book really got me around seeing a different side of what a marvelous organ the brain truly is and how complex and intricate the connections are. I have worked extensively with a wide variety of Alzheimers and Dementia care patients, so I am not really surprised by the novelty of things the human mind may be able to come up with so much as the authors explanation for how these connections can be made/rewired. I have to say, that I think the book is geared somewhat to people like myself, or who were brought up with a similar mindset about the way the brain functions and you can tell from early on the author is really trying to get the reader to see that the brain has plastic aspects and can readily adapt to a wide variety of circumstances. I like his message of perseverance in a number of areas from stroke victims to autistic individuals, where new treatment incorporating mind set and using mind exercises to overcome difficult and devastating physical problems is a good one. I think that we underestimated what we are sometimes capable of in terms of recovery, and what pathways can be laid down even later in life. Overall I though there was a lot of really interesting stories provided and good content on the subject. "

31,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70432013-darius-murretti,4,"Attention new parents : According to this book a recent study of more than 2600 toddlers showed that early exposure to TV in children 1 to 3 years of age each hour per day that they spent watching TV increased their chances of developing serious problems controlling their attention and impulses later in childhood by an additional 10% per hour watched per day over a control group who watched no TV at that age .The book goes on to say that 43% of US children 2 yrs or younger watch TV daily and 25% of US children 2 yrs of younger have TVs in their bedrooms . About 20 years after the spread of TV teachers began to notice that there students had become more restless and had increasing difficulty paying attention. Jane Healy documented these changes in her book: ENDANGERED MINDS speculating that these problems were teh result of plastic changes in teh children's brains (our brain is especially ""plastic "" (malleable) at that ages 1-7 .... NOTE: I read this right after I read THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF by BRUCE LIPTON . In my opinion the two books go together This book talks about how --on a use it or lose it basis --the neurons in your brain can rapidly reform and rewire themselves into different patterns ( called nerve impulse maps because the flow of consciousness can be mapped by brain scans or autopsies ) . Various regions (cortex) and parts(organelle) of our brain that enable various actions ( speech , language , seeing , music , math , playing a sport , balancing , socializing , parenting ) grow in size and vigor according to how much they are used . For example:  a musician has a very large and vigorous MAP in the area of the brain that is needed to play their instrument . Pearl divers have a large and vigorous MAP in their visual cortex that enables them to see clearly underwater (WITHOUT GOOGLES) . The MAPs controlling sense of touch and hearing of a blind person will grow large and vigorous and neurological connections to the visual cortex of the blind person to create a image of the blind person's surroundings in the blind persons brain . The brain of a person who goes to a country where a new language is spoke This ability of our brain to change the shape and neurological connections so as to redirect the flow of nerve impulses to new areas as we learn new behaviors and ways.The brain of a drug or porn addict will lose its MAP to be selflessly loving and caring for others and a MAP that selfishly seeks pleasure and links pleasure to violent and perverted pathways will grow increasingly large and vigorous and take over the brain . Thus the NEUROPLASTIC nature of our brain can rapidly create good (helpful) or bad (harmful )maps in response to how and fro what we use our brains. While most of this book is devoted to people who have been brain challenged from birth or from an accident or medical condition( stroke etc) making extremely inspiring and brilliant recoveries to and above normalcy. This book has a chapter on the debilitating effects of pornography addiction and how that changes the brain which solidly scientifically supports what my friend W^B^GA says in her warning discussion to women who read/write M/M literature which is here : https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...? So if you don't read M/M and erotica don't start and if you do get help and stop ASAP ! If you know others taking up erotica urge them to stop because it changes your By reading erotica and viewing porn you are NOT exploring your sexual preferences you are shaping them in ways that are a disaster to you personally , socially , professionally and psychologically and becoming mentally ill .To get the same amount of pleasure you musty watch hard and harder core stuff that turns sex from a loving act between two life partners into a violent degrading acting out of porn scripts .This ruins your family life and ultimately can reshape your brain into a worse that a addicted sex criminal that would molest your own spouse and even children.  As Dr. Doidge puts it, “Those who use [pornography] have no sense to the extent to which their brains are reshaped by it.” Indeed, they have no idea that pornography is developing “new maps in their brains.”Quoting Dr Doidge's documentation of many patients decent into pornography https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/20... says : "" Norman Doidge, MD—a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and author of the New York Times and international bestseller, The Brain That Changes Itself—explores the impact of neuroplasticity on sexual attraction in an essay in The Social Costs of Pornography. Dr. Doidge notes that brain tissue involved with sexual preferences (i.e., what “turns us on”) is especially malleable. Thus, outside stimuli—like pornographic images—that link previously unrelated things (e.g., physical torture and sexual arousal) can cause previously unrelated neurons within the brain to learn to “fire” in tandem so that the next time around, physical torture actually does trigger sexual arousal in the brain. This in-tandem firing of neurons creates “links” or associations that result in powerful new brain pathways that remain even after the instigating outside stimuli are taken away. Unlike food or other natural rewards, cause “persistent change in synaptic plasticity.” In other words, internet pornography does more than just spike the level of dopamine in the brain for a pleasure sensation. It literally changes the physical matter within the brain so that new neurological pathways require pornographic material in order to trigger the desired reward sensation.So how does internet pornography compare with illegal addictive chemical substances like cocaine or heroin? Cocaine is considered a stimulant that increases dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter that most addictive substances release, as it causes a “high” and a subsequent craving for a repetition of the high, rather than a subsequent feeling of satisfaction by way of endorphins. Heroin, on the other hand, is an opiate, which has a relaxing effect. Both drugs trigger chemical tolerance, which requires higher quantities of the drug to be used each time to achieve the same intensity of effect.Pornography, by both arousing (the “high” effect via dopamine) and causing an orgasm (the “release” effect via opiates), is a type of polydrug that triggers both types of addictive brain chemicals in one punch, enhancing its addictive propensity as well as its power to instigate a pattern of increasing tolerance. Tolerance in pornography’s case requires not necessarily greater quantities of pornography but more novel pornographic content like more taboo sexual acts, child pornography, or sadomasochistic pornography.Sexual arousal is the result of testosterone, dopamine, and norepinephrine surges, whereas the transcendence and euphoria experienced during orgasm are related to the release of endogenous opiates. While pornography activates the appetitive system by way of dopamine, an orgasm caused by pornography does not release endorphins, which are the chemicals that make us feel satisfied. By contrast, endorphins are released after an orgasm caused by having sex with a real human being. This lack of satisfaction, combined with the brain’s competitive plasticity, causes the brain to require more and more novel and extreme images to get the same chemical result as before.While the addictive effects of internet pornography are similar to a combination of addictive chemical substances, internet pornography’s effects go beyond those of chemical substances.For instance, “mirror neurons” in the brain enable us to learn by watching a behavior and copying it. Professor Struthers writes that, because of mirror neurons, “Viewing a pornographic [video] creates a neurological experience whereby a person vicariously participates in what he is watching.” This uniquely interactive addiction is enabled by the combination of stimuli upon both the brain and the body; in Struthers’ words, porn use “involves the visual system (looking at porn), the motor system (masturbating), the sensory system (genital stimulation), and neurological effects of arousal and orgasm (sexual euphoria from chemical opiates like addictive dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and reduced fear in the amygdala).”Another aspect of pornography addiction that surpasses the addictive and harmful characteristics of chemical substance abuse is its permanence. While substances can be metabolized out of the body, pornographic images cannot be metabolized out of the brain because pornographic images are stored in the brain’s memory. While substance abusers may cause permanent harm to their bodies or brains from drug use, the substance itself does not remain in the body after it has metabolized out of the body. But with pornography, there is no time frame of abstinence that can erase the pornographic “reels” of images in the brain that can continue to fuel the addictive cycle.In sum, brain research confirms the critical fact that pornography is a drug delivery system that has a distinct and powerful effect upon the human brain and nervous system. More akin to cocaine than to books or public speeches, internet pornography is not the sort of “speech” the First Amendment was meant to protect from government censorship—as I will argue tomorrow. Those who read books or listen to ideas can use their conscious minds to reason through the assertions and information. But, as Dr. Doidge puts it, “Those who use [pornography] have no sense to the extent to which their brains are reshaped by it.” Indeed, they have no idea that pornography is developing “new maps in their brains.”It was Dr. Doidge astounding how by just imagining doing something brought about the same Brain changes as doing thing ( for example those who sat at a piano and imagined paying a piece of music on it for a few weeks could play just as well as a group of people who practiced with their hands) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeve3... is a video on ho porn destroys your brain's pleasure receptors requiring you to seek more and more extreme forms of porn to get teh same amount of pleasure .Dr Doidge explains that this is why the porn industry keeps coming up with harder and harder core themes and why so many formerly normal human beings( goodreads members ) and into darker and darker and more and more twisted ""romance "" novels .Dr Doidge says (as of the writing of the book) that the 4th more common reason people go on line is to view porn and it keeps getting harder and harder . Ultimately the addicts loose interest in there real life sex partner and prefer porn. (porn is a form of infidelity) This is having a catastrophic effect on society and our children.But as I said this os only about 20-25% of the book . Most of the rest is very inspiring and positive.Much of it is on senility and how it can be reversed by things like learning new dance steps and other such positive up beat topics .I would be remiss if I did not that the human brain can be rewired to consciously contact God and enjoy supreme bliss during this very life which is the ultimate rewiring and evolution of our Plastic(changeable) brain....the neurological pathways for this are opposite to those used in porn...Also that unlike all other addictions addiction to spirituality is something you never develop a tolerance for . It never becomes flat and insipid but goes on increasing in bliss with no downside . Anything less than rewiring the brain to ""spirit "" ( aka universal Consciousness ,creative energy , God etc) is going to leave a human being feeling less than complete and satisfied ...Also by ""spirit "" I am referring to a non physical heavenly sound that all human beings have the capacity to hear (it has nothing to do with tinnitus) ""spirituality "" is the science of hearing this sound under the guidance of a qualified teacher ( free of charge) and uniting one's consciousness with it and traveling back to its source . as per http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/path... (see chapter 11 on this sound current ) ( see also chapter 6 which basically says the same thing as Dr Doidge's book ) see also my review of THE RINGING RADIANCE https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I maintain that the cause of all human suffering and dissatisfaction is disconnection from the ""spirit"" and if one is feeling weary of life and unhappy one should reconnect with this spirit by listening to it daily 😊"
32,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,2,"I think I'm decided on 2.5 stars now, but this book is exceedingly difficult to rate. On the one hand, the science of neuroplasticity, the idea that the brain can change and adapt throughout its lifetime, is fascinating stuff. I really can't put into words how much this scientific theory thrills me. It also, in many ways, makes so much sense; the discussions on adult language learning, in particular, felt much closer to reality, than the conventional belief that the brain is only capable of fully adapting to an unfamiliar language as a child: 
Competitive plasticity in adults even explains some of our limitations. Think of the difficulty most adults have in learning a second language. The conventional view now is that the difficulty arises because the critical period for language learning has ended, leaving us with a brain too rigid to change its structure on a large scale. But the discovery of competitive plasticity suggests there is more to it. As we age, the more we use our native language, the more it comes to dominate our linguistic map space. Thus it is also because our brain is plastic—and because plasticity is competitive—that it is so hard to learn a new language and end the tyranny of the mother tongue. But why, if this is true, is it easier to learn a second language when we are young? Is there not competition then too? Not really. If two languages are learned at the same time, during the critical period, both get a foothold. Brain scans, says Merzenich, show that in a bilingual child all the sounds of its two languages share a single large map, a library of sounds from both languages.
 Neuoroplasticity also offers an answer to the question on pain in ""phantom"" limbs—that is, the question on why some of owners of limbs that have been lost still suffer from pain ""from"" the lost limb. This also gives rise to an amazing theory about pain really being based in the brain: 
But as phantoms show, we don’t need a body part or even pain receptors to feel pain. We need only a body image, produced by our brain maps. People with actual limbs don’t usually realize this, because the body images of our limbs are perfectly projected onto our actual limbs, making it impossible to distinguish our body image from our body. “Your own body is a phantom,” says Ramachandran, “one that your brain has constructed purely for convenience.”
 I could go on, but I'll limit myself to just these two examples, but the incredible stories on brains radically restructuring really made this worth a read.Now time for the other hand. I began questioning early on if Doidge was himself a ""scientist"", because he was acting in way scientists never would; he was consistently over-generalising and relaying on such individual, specific cases to make grandiose claims about everyone. I'm not a scientist either, but this failed to convince and really left me confused about the reliability on the rest of the book. The chapter on ""sexual perversions"" was terrible, with descriptions of child sexual abuse for reasons that I failed to grasp and questionable conclusions on people's individual sexual preferences. Difference does not mean people's brains are necessarily ""wrong"". He also writes a long chapter claiming that neuroplasticity gives psychoanalysis a scientific basis and constantly quotes Freud. I also don't believe neuroplasticity is quite as controversial as Doidge was trying to make out, although that might be down to this book originally being published in 2007.Finally, there is also in-depth discussion of animal cruelty in scientific experiments. Now, I fully accept that there are strong arguments on both sides on why animal testing is needed/not needed, right/not right, and I personally I am not completely against animal testing if it is properly regulated and there are limits, but some of the descriptions here were clearly excessive. And I don't mean the experiments themselves, I mean how Doidge chose to describe them in such excruciating detail. It was just not necessary. I found the tone (matter-of-fact, no big deal, shrug) really strange at these points, and I honestly had to skim sections here, because it was just too much. So I advise people to be careful going into this book, if you think that might affect you.I would have loved this book if it was written by a neuroscientist. Looking it up quickly now, Dodige seems to be a psychologist and/or science journalist, and I can't help coming away feeling fairly dubious about a lot of the claims made. There's got to be a better book on this very topic out there somewhere."
33,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8089601-jodi,3,"The book gives the message that all sorts of amazing things can be done through lots of brain retraining work, but doesn't claim that it is a quick and easy cure for everything either, which I appreciated.Some people are taking the idea of neuroplasticity and running with it and maybe going a bit too far and claiming that we can retrain our brains to be any way we want (such as choosing our sexuality), and to use it to cure completely every neurological disease. It is disturbing. But this book doesn't at all support these sorts of unreasonable notions, fortunately.This book explains that amazing changes can be made to improve people with congenital issues, diseases or brain injuries or that wish to reverse negative learned behaviours - but that these changes take lots of hard work and also that they are limited in some cases. Recovery from brain injuries will often be partial and not total. Not all neurological function that is lost through a brain injury can be fully restored. All we can do is try our hardest and do our best.(The idea that everyone so injured could be totally well again if they just put the time into rehabilitation worries me a little. Again, this idea is not supported in the book, I'm referring to worrying and ignorant comments made elsewhere.)Partial recoveries are still very very exciting though and nothing to sneeze at, especially when people are very ill and disabled to begin with. It is very exciting stuff, this book.This book would be very encouraging to read for those who have had strokes and would like to learn to walk again. The bits at the start of the book about how neuroplasticity may allow people that are blind or deaf from birth to see and to hear, were astounding to read about.I was fascinated to read about how one can compensate for a failed vestibular system with vision, as this is something I and many other M.E. patients have done.I couldn't help but think about this compensation in M.E. patients as I read the book. It is a natural phenomena, which is kind of fascinating to me. But it is only a partial solution - which sort of supports the notions in this book of targeted and purposeful brain retraining being so powerful I guess.This natural brain retraining of the vestibular system works well, but leaves you in a hideous situation if you are even plunged into a totally dark environment - such as when the power goes out. You suddenly have no sense of up or down and the world spins horribly, so much so that you are too ill to crawl towards the torch or lighter that can save you.I keep torches within reach in every room I spend time in, I have to. This problem also means many of us need to sleep with a nightlight, as your body seems to need to know up from down when you are sleeping too. I also need to make sure when I walk that nothing in the room moves, or else I feel about to fall over and lose my equilibrium for a few minutes and have to clutch at things to not fall over.But far better all these problems than going back to when I didn't really have any sort of vastibular system and would be constantly spinning and feeling I was rolling off my flat bed, or feel I was falling backwards the whole time I was walking upright! As the women in the book said too, it is also awful always walking with your feet so wide apart for balance as well. I'm so used to it now, but it would be wonderful to one day no longer have to do so! Maybe in time, and with the ideas in this book put into use, this could happen? I'd like to think so.Reading about how well-known these visual compensations for vestibular problems are was a bit hard going for me at times, as it made me quite annoyed and sad that so few doctors and neurologists seem to know about them and that we as patients are each treated as if this problem were unique to us, when it is so obviously not. The woman with vestibular symptoms mentioned in this book described my symptoms so well. It is a bit maddening how behind with real cutting-edge research and information so many medical professionals are.If I can improve my health to the point of being out and about in the world again, and my vestibular function hasn't improved along with the rest of me, I'll definitely try the under-tongue vestibular re-trainer device (I forget the proper name for it used in the book!) if I can.This book was exciting to read and gave me hope for my future and one day being able to try out some of these ideas for myself. But for right now, with a brain injury that also has had systemic effects and caused cardiac insufficiency and an inability to do anything but the most basic tasks (I'm housebound and 95% bedbound and very limited with talking and movement etc. as well), it is impossible and would result in relapse and loss of function rather than improvements. Having an ongoing disease process which means your activity level is severely restricted as well as neurological problems is a different kettle of fish to fixing neurological issues which are not ongoing, such as a stroke, say. You need to be able to put the work in, and not have a disease which is worsening for physical reasons too I guess. But hope for the future is still hope.The parts supporting animal studies in the book made me feel quite uncomfortable. I would personally rather they had been omitted from the book as they detract from the important main message.I also have to admit that I was a bit disappointed after reading the book and hearing so many good things said about it that it wasn't edited to a somewhat higher standard, and organised a bit better. Parts of the book were quite boring to read and it'd have been great if the book had summarised the main points in the final chapter instead of just kind of petering out. The book was well written, but could maybe have been made even better with a good edit.All through the book I kept wondering how much more positive the results from these treatments would be if they were combined with patients being given all the nutrients their brains need to function well and to heal. Nutritional medicine is vital for anyone recovering form a brain injury or similar, the body needs to have all the basic building blocks necessary to make repairs and to function properly, no matter what other treatments are tried. Although this topic is mostly ignored in this book, there was one comment towards the end where the author said that although nutrition was not his area that a properly designed supplement regime is 'a common practice that we should all be pursuing' which is hard to argue with.For anyone interested in this topic books such as Detoxify or Die, Eat Fat, Lose Fat: The Healthy Alternative to Trans Fats, Deep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food and Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life and others are a great start. (These books and others like them have let me very slowly start to improve my own health, FWIW.)Overall this book is a fascinating and engaging read, especially if you are facing a neurological disease or other neurological problem. I'd highly recommend checking to see if your library has a copy. The books on neurological case studies by Oliver Sacks are also a very interesting read if you have any type of brain injury.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis "
34,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart,5,"This is an important, comprehensive book about neuroplasticity. This concept refers to the fact that, as is now recognized, the brain can change its structure and in fact does so with each different activity it performs, “perfecting its circuits so it was better suited to the task it had”. The damaged brain can often reorganize itself so that when one part fails, another can often substitute. Thinking, learning and acting can turn our genes on and off.We are introduced to Paul Bach-y-Rita, one of the great pioneers in understanding brain plasticity. He has devised amazing machines that have helped to cure people regarded as hopeless cases; among other things, he enabled people who had been blind from birth to see.Previously, the brain was seen as made of parts, each in a pre-assigned location, each performing a single function, so that if one of those parts were damaged, nothing could be done to replace it. This theory was termed localizationism. Paul Bach-y-Rita rejected localizationism, showing that if one sense is damaged, another can sometimes take over for it - sensory substitution. “We can see with our brains, not with our eyes.”The book is filled with inspiring stories of people recovering from incapacitating injuries by means of this “new” understanding that the brain can change itself. Bach-y-Rita’s own father had been seriously disabled after a massive stroke. Post-mortem examination of his brain revealed that the lesion in question had never healed, though through intensive training he had recovered many functions. Patients paralyzed for twenty years can make late recoveries with brain-stimulating exercises.The brain is like a muscle that grows with exercise – education increases the number of branches among neurons.Another brilliant expert in neuroplasticity is Michael Merzenich. He states that “practicing a new skill … can change hundreds of millions and possibly billions of the connections between the nerve cells in our brain maps”. He has designed the cochlear implant, which allows congenitally deaf children to hear. His series of computer programmes, Fast ForWord, has helped hundreds of thousands, including autistic children, after only 30-60 hours of treatment.Merzenich started a company called Posit Science which helps people preserve the plasticity of their brains as they age. I myself have now begun to do these Posit Science exercises on the net every day to prevent cognitive decline. There are exercises for memory of words and language which rebuild the brain’s basic ability to process sound. They increase processing speed and “make basic signals stronger, sharper and more accurate, while stimulating the brain to produce the dopamine and acetylcholine”. Studies show that brain exercises do not only slow age-related cognitive decline but can lead to improved functioning.Merzenich has also worked on eliminating problematic brain maps to help those with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), phobias, etc.There is an interesting chapter about how childhood experiences influence our sexual behavior as adults. The author also discusses and explains pornography addiction.Edward Taub opened a clinic to study strokes and developed valuable exercises to force those affected by strokes to use their paralyzed limbs. Patients wear mitts on their good hands and slings on their good arms. They drill six hours a day for 10-15 days. Treatment works for virtually all stroke survivors who are left with some ability to move their fingers. People have been trained to use completely paralyzed hands; 80% of stroke patients who have lost arm function can improve substantially.Plasticity can also be used to stop worrying, obsessions, compulsions and bad habits. We also learn how phantom pain (in amputated limbs) can be overcome. This work was done by V.S. Ramachandran through use of a mirror box. Patients watch a mirror image reflection of their good hand, for instance, moving back and forth, and their paralyzed hand will thus also seem to move back and forth. The brain thus believes that the affected limb can move, and soon it does in fact start to move!There is a chapter about imagination and one on how the brain changes through psychotherapy. Psychoanalysis is in fact a neuroplastic therapy.This book contains much more than I have touched on here. I found it to be a fascinating, exceedingly readable book despite its scientific content, revealing amazing techniques and cures for people with incapacitating injuries. This is no dry technical account – the author describes the brain therapists he encounters in very personal, pictorial ways, depicting their various idiosyncrasies and making us feel we ourselves know them personally. He presents innumerable personal stories of the patients whose lives have been transformed.One of the next books to be put on my reading list is another one about the brain, this time by V.S. Ramachandran.I highly recommend that you read this fascinating, inspiring book which, though filled with scientific detail, I found exceedingly readable and unputdownable."

36,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1425694-c,3,"Given that I'm unlikely to study a popular science book in order to commit to memory the details, I consider it to be a success if it influences my general knowledge of an area; my understanding of its underlying assumptions or principles. In that respect, this book failed: nothing it said changed or contradicted my understanding of the brain and neuroplasticity. It was, nonetheless, quite interesting, though badly written in many places, and it did expand my understanding of the breadth of application of neuroplasticity, which was nice. Just - why does he have to be a Freudian? I could barely force myself through those two chapters about Freud (I thought he'd been totally discredited by now, anyway?). They were SO BAD that they actually induced in me the urge to kill something._____________________________I'm developing a hypothesis about science that people take the gaps in our knowledge and fill them with things that suit their agenda, which usually means things that support the status quo. This is not a tried and tested hypothesis; it is in its infancy. But neuroscience, at this point in history, seems to be one of the disciplines most vulnerable to misuse. Because, we know NOTHING about the brain. Seriously. So, you take a brain scan of someone's head and look at where most blood is going when the someone is doing a particular activity. Some parts light up. What does this mean? WE DON'T KNOW. As far as I'm aware, there is no evidence linking scans such as these to, for example, behaviour.But then, I'm not a neuroscientist. I'm just a relatively-smart, relatively well-educated member of the public who already feels deeply insulted by the patronising tone of this book. Did I mention I'm in a bad mood?____________________________Isn't it 'neuroscience'?"
37,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70339924-yvette-prior,5,Excellent book with easy to understand explanations about how the brain evolves and morphs with experiences and habits.
38,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1349824-carol,5,"Having struggled through numerous medical and psyhological studies and texts during my college years, I can safely say that this book is amazing in its straight-forward, educated approach, while still speaking a language that anyone can understand. It would have been incredibly easy to have written this using medical terminology and while some of it is used, it is not done in a ""speaking down to you"" sort of way. Doidge is clearly fascinated by his topic and, more importantly, wants the reader to be as well. That isn't hard at all given the amazing stories of the human brain that he has to tell. He basically summarizes all the studies done in relation to brain plasticity (meaning the brain can change itself and is NOT the rigid and set organ it was originally thought to be)in the last decades of the 20th Century. Doidge does so in a way that does not drone like a college textbook or lecture. In fact, this is one of the most captivating non-fiction books I've ever read and wish more college books had presented information in such a way! The implications of the information presented is outstanding and it will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years as research continues.This is not a book for animal rights activists, but definitely for ANYONE with an interest in the human ability to adapt. It's also a great companion book to  The Scientist in the Crib which I was somehow reading at the same time, but deals with how the human mind develops in babies and children."
39,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/775264-leslie,5,"I recommended this book to at least 10 people while I was reading it. It is a fascinating synthesis of multiple areas of neuroplasticity research, focusing most intently on that of Michael Merzenich of UCSF. It tackles balance, motor, learning, and psychological problems, and pain as well as aging. It only goes into mechanical and behavioral strategies for addressing all of these issues (except SSRIs to help with memory in severe depression or OCD). Tacitly, it seems to imply that most of the drugs we use could be obviated if we knew enough about how to manipulate our environmental stimuli and our neural responses to them. At the least, this work powerfully demonstrates the importance of not resigning ourselves to most neurological badness: if we can muster sufficient motivation, we can often retrain motor, sensory, cognitive, and affective networks to good function. The caveat is that we can't stop learning. Our brains have more neural loss and less regenerative potential when not constantly challenged. It's a true ""use it or lose it"" system."
40,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163567-siri,0,This book is so dense and fascinating! It really makes you realize 1.) how little we know about how the brain works and 2.) how much possibility there is for making huge strides in things like brain injury and mental illness even based on that small amount that we now know. 
41,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212447-sharon-barrow-wilfong,4,"This book immediately intrigued me when I read of it in a news article. The premise is that certain beliefs about the brain have been fairly recently been proven false.One that the brain does not change and secondly that brain function is localized and permanent.Dr. Dodge interviews a number of neurologists, scientists, behavioralists and other professionals and also case studies to prove this case.The first chapter describes Cheryl, who feels as though she is always falling. Her vestibular system stopped working and she can no longer balance. She is helped by Paul Bach-y-Rita who has developed a machine, that replaces the vestibular system and sends balance signals to her brain. While wearing the machine, it's like a construction hat, Cheryl can stand without falling. Eventually, the effects last for a while after she has taken the ""hat"" off and it is lasting for longer periods of time. How is this so? Bach-y-Rita states that this is where brain plasticity comes in. The brain is learning to use other pathways to replace the damaged neuro-pathways.And this is the basic premise of the book. All the case studies, stroke victims, amputees, learning disabled et al... go through therapy that cause the brain to change itself, to bypass damaged neurotransmitters and create new pathways to perform the lost function.This has been especially useful with stroke victims who have lost the use of an arm or hand. Through careful therapy that trains the brain to reorganize itself the case studies in this book have regained either most of complete use of previously paralyzed limbs.Doidge recounts case studies of blind people whose brains have taken over the part of the brain that processes sight and began using it for hearing. He describes a remarkable account of a woman who, after losing her sight, can listen to books on her computer faster than sighted people can comprehend. She can hear up to three books a day.Conversely, studies have shown that deaf people have more developed peripheral vision than sighted people. Another interesting study was about ""phantom"" limbs. This is the sad phenomena that sometimes occurs when someone loses an arm or leg but still feels pain where the arm or limb used to be. This can be so debilitating that people have committed suicide to escape from the never ending pain signals. Dr. Ramachandran developed a therapy system that rewired the ""pain map"" of the brain to stop the brain from sending signals about limbs that no longer exist.One of the, I'm sure, more controversial chapters is about sexual attraction and how our early childhood experiences can map our brains to determine what and who attracts us. It offers hope for people who are mired into deviant sexual practices that would like to escape but feel they can't. One case study is about a man whose mother sexually abused him when he was very young. As an adult he found himself in relationships with women who demanded violent sexual experiences. Doidge also asserts that our attraction to specific genders can be shaped by and reshaped due to experiences and then later therapeutic experiences that overcome the early experiences. I'm sure some will disagree, but scientists have known for years that what information we put in our brain causes chemical reactions that shape our mind and behavior.Not just sexually, but in every area of life.Probably the most fascinating case study was of a young woman who was born with half a brain. This was not discovered for some years because the other hemisphere had taken over the function of the other half.The most questionable chapter had to do with culture and how it maps our brain. Doidge describes how the language we learn from infancy is going to shape our brains specific ways, but also how culture can shape our brains and even our senses. He uses as an example, a group of nomadic people called the ""Sea Gypsies"" who live among the tropical islands in the Burmese Archipelago who live most of their lives on boats and in the water harvesting sea cucumbers. Their ability to see underwater is significantly more advanced than any other group of people.The final appendix details some disturbing information about how totalitarian regimes and the media can shape our brains.It is common knowledge that what information we process can shape how we think, but Doidge goes farther in saying that the changes happen physically as well and determine how our neurotransmitters travel and map our brain.It seems obvious that what you fill your mind with is going to help you think on either a more critical level, non-reflective level or even in a way that could be called brainwashed. Looking at some of the mob-like activities occurring on certain college campuses today, I think we can say that certain educators are certainly doing their best to indoctrinate their students rather than give them a quality education.Doidge describes the education systems in totalitarian countries like North Korea to prove that the same happens there. No big surprise there. He also described the brainwashing of people who join certain cults, but I thought this had been debunked. My only question, is what extensive research has been made to prove that the brain map has been changed on a physical level. This was not as clear.However, if it is changed, the good news, is that it does not have to be permanent.Finally, Doidge does not simply give case studies but also biographies of the scientists, Doctors and educators as well as describing their research. This alone makes the book enjoyable.My criticism would be that as informative and interesting as I found this book, I did feel that perhaps the case studies were a little cherry picked. I wondered why he did not mention Ben Carson's work with partial lobotomies for patients suffering chronic seizures or even the famous case of Phineas Gage, the 19th century railroad worker that suffered a pole through his frontal lobe from an explosion. A lot of information about where specific brain functions operate was discovered from Gage's accident and his subsequent behavior.I think it would be prudent to read more than one book on the topic of brain plasticity. "
42,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54689236-nicole,3,"This was a really interesting collection of stories of how brain plasticity works unfortunately it was very dense and pretty dry As a psychology student, I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to learn about some other studies and anecdotes of brain plasticity that I haven't heard of before although a lot of the studies in this book I was aware of. Unfortunately I found this book to be very dry. It wasn't the most engaging book to read. There was a lot of medical and technical jargon used. As a psychology student I could follow most of it but I don't think the average lay person would understand a lot of what was discussed in this book. The audiobook really helped keep me focused though. There was a lot of discussion around Freud. It just felt a bit too much in places. I would have preferred more scientific studies. Overall, this book was interesting and I did learn a couple of new things but it was very dry and hard to read at times."

46,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31245982-billyskye,3,"Norman Doidge’s The Brain That Changes Itself helped validate certain beliefs that I’ve heretofore held without rigorous grounding – namely that the mind’s level of malleability is significantly more pronounced than that for which it is generally given credit. I am grateful for this. That said, I couldn’t help but feel as if the central tenets of the book’s thesis – an argument for neuroplasiticity over localizationism, as well as an explanation of the implications of this new understanding – could have been addressed more succinctly in a solid academic paper. The rest of the material– perfunctory, ‘uplifting’ anecdotes – had to be endured and consequently a lot of the potential force of the book was lost in the noise. I suppose I should have seen this coming in a work that sports a subtitle of “stories of personal triumph from the frontiers of brain science.” Somehow I missed this. In the timeless vernacular of Governor Rick Perry, “Oops.” The first three chapters were terrific. I really enjoyed the manner in which Dr. Doidge took the reader through historical developments in neuroscience, introducing me to the field’s canon and reinforcing concepts like the Penfield Map, Broca/Wernicke’s area, the critical period, and the adage “neurons that fire together wire together” etc. This section certainly gave me additional lexical tools with which to discuss topics of the brain/mind going forward. For that I am quite appreciative (as an aside: the appendices, which discussed topics like the impact of culture on the ‘wiring’ of the brain and the relationship between aging and plasticity, were also great.). Then things got a little strange.Somewhere along the way, Dr. Doidge gives the reader the slip and transitions from applying the concept of plasticity to fairly straightforward cortical processes (motion, sight, auditory response etc) to more complex psychological conditions that, to my knowledge at least, still linger on the periphery of human understanding (tastes, preferences, opinions, moods, etc). While I understand the premise of this continuation (and largely agree with it in theory) – that ‘brain’ and ‘mind’ are not distinct entities as seems intuitive, there is no ‘Cartesian Theater’ – the dearth of scientific evidence comparable to that which had been so elegantly woven into the text earlier was troubling to say the least. The problems with this vein of thinking presented themselves quickly as the author appeared unable to avoid inserting his own ethical paradigms into the survey. With this, the sententious grumblings of a crotchety old man came out in full force. Children these days were less good at certain things because schools no longer placed a premium on rote memorization and legalistic learning structures. Internet pornography molds the plastic mind towards sexual deviance. Juvenescent events can produce ‘incorrect’ brain maps that need to be reworked with the ‘mental surgery’ of psychoanalysis. Putting aside the misstep of assigning value to certain traits over others, the logic implicit in these moralizing claims that experiences impact how people act and behave, and that action and behavior can be altered, is strikingly obvious and need not be written on. Yet, Dr. Doidge appears to be arguing precisely this, only with an emphasis on the fact that the impact is “more than you would think.” How much more and the manner in which these effects are manifested is never made clear with the exception of a few data points supplied in the form of select anecdotal evidence. Further, the notion that the mind in all its complex psychological states can be consciously altered if one possesses the right mettle creates a bizarre infinite regress of will (this temperament to alter temperaments plastically must then also surely be plastic and, if so, what is motivating it to motivate change? Oh dear.), which makes it apparent that the author continues to rely on the noumenological conception of self he decries and is therefore no closer to solving the hard problem of consciousness. As with most non-fiction books styled in the TED Talk tradition, The Brain That Changes Itself suffers from a lack of academic introspection. Instead of presenting a nuanced and scholarly analysis of the issues in play, it settles for the cheap headline. It crows over the tales that fall in line with its digestible thesis, and feigns ignorance of anything that falls outside the parameters of the proposed trend. Three stars. Those poor, poor monkeys. Also, don’t put your honorific in your byline. So not fetch. "
47,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8297884-m-j-johnson,3,"The Brain That Changes Itself is a psychology/science book that is easily approached by any layman like myself. It is written in bite-sized segments and I certainly found it an enjoyable and fascinating read. The basic premise of the book is that the brain is ‘plastic’ rather than (as scientists believed for many generations) irrevocably hard-wired. Doidge presents us with a number of jaw-dropping case histories to back up his theories and the book has quite a large ‘wow’ factor. I read with great fascination how an academic after suffering a most devastating stroke which destoyed a large part of his brain, leaving him with very little speech and partly paralysed, was able to make a complete recovery by ‘rewiring’ his brain, literally by-passing the damaged part. Or how the girl born with only a right hemisphere to her brain had been able to seemingly do the impossible and operate fairly normally.These are inspiring stories, yet I can’t help feeling there’s something missing here. I’m not accusing Norman Doidge MD of being a snake-oil salesman, however, this book often reminded me of one of those best-selling self-help books that has you cheering but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unconvinced and dissatisfied. Just like the writers of self-help books are apt to do, the author here relies mostly on individual case-histories and he gives very few scientifically backed up facts or statistics. The section on psychoanalysis again makes the kinds of leaps and jumps that might be acceptable in a pacy thriller but I kept asking myself ‘Hang on just a minute there! Just because Mr X lost his mum at the age of three and has always had problems showing his wife affection, this all seems a little bit too much like a tit-bit style magazine when a psychiatrist comes along and puts two and two together, after which the patient has a few significant dreams and in the final scene Mr X goes off happily restored, a devoted family man again.’In the early part of the book a number of neuroplasticity experiments are dispassionately quoted, and I have to say, when monkeys had nerves in their hands or arms severed and probes inserted into their brains, or kittens were deliberately blinded by sewing up an eyelid, I did feel a little queasy. I found the section on addiction, particularly the part on sex addiction, sado-masochism etc really quite shocking too. However, I’m not entirely sure whether the startling conclusions the author comes to in support of neuroplasticity are always quite as clear-cut as the author would have me believe. I think what I’m saying (as someone who is a completely non-scientific person) that I’m really not certain this book is good science. The Brain That Changes Itself is an enjoyable read and I’m sure there is much more to learn about neuroplasticity, but I’m not sure I can fully endorse all the claims put forward in this book."
48,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"The full title of this book is The Brain that Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science and in it author Norman Doidage examines the concept of ""brain plasticity."" Essentially this has to do with the ability of the human brain (and the mouse brain and the chimp brain, for that matter) to change in response to trauma, disease, or some graduate student with a bone saw and a fist full of electrodes. /p>One of the early examples in the book deals with a woman who suffered damage to the part of her brain that deals with balance, leaving her with the sensation of perpetual free fall any time she rose to anything above a completely horizontal position. But by controlling a machine with a sensor attached to her tongue of all things, she was able to remap her brain so that a different part took over the balancing gig and she could once again stand up and walk a straight line. /p>Like other good science writings, The Brain that Changes Itself is filled with personal stories like this one, and they cover some pretty varied ground. One part of the book deals with blind people who learn to ""see"" by having a computer translate images into physical pressure on different parts of their otherwise vestigial eyeballs. Another looks at what effects hard core pornography has on the brain (besides the obvious one). Yet really graphic and cringe-inducing section deals with sado masochism and its origins in the dark side of neuroplasticity. And my favorite section dealt with a group chimps, some scientists that were deliberately causing them brain damage, the birth of PETA, and the protracted destruction of a gifted neuroscientist's career. It's all pretty compelling and really, really interesting since it's tied directly into lessons on how the brain works./p>My only complaint about the book is that Doidage goes off in some pretty weird directions, such as his condemnation of porn --not that I disagree with the condemnation, it's just that his arguments come from a pretty odd direction. And about three quarters of the way through he switches gears a bit into a staunch defendant of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis in general. This wouldn't be so bad (it's still educational), except that the case study he employs in this section laughably ticks off every item on the list of psychoanalysis cliches --emotionally distant man who the psychoanalyst asks to ""tell me about your mother"" and who uncovers buried memories until he's curled up in the fetal position on the couch and bawling like a child. It was just a wee bit over the top./p>Still, those parts aside I liked this book. It's brain science made fun and interesting."
49,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5133024-pam,5,"A fascinating and encouraging look at ways in which the brain has been trained, conditioned, or restructured on its own to change in ways that were previously believed impossible. Accessible even for a non scientific brain such as mine! Such an hopeful book. "
50,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/424136-joell-smith-borne,3,"This was thought provoking, and filled with fascinating stories about the way the brain can rewire itself in response to all kinds of situations. Led me to some more recent research on the subject of ""brain training""--now I just have to sit down and read that. Ultimately, I took it with a grain of salt. Like a lot of pop science books (I'm looking at you, The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business!) the author seems to be trying to tie together thematically a lot of different streams of research, and to use cool stories of huge change in individuals to represent what's possible. Ultimately, I got less excited the farther along I got, and ended up not reading all the appendixes and whatnot at the end.ETA: Just found this article: Your brain on pseudoscience: the rise of popular neurobollocks, and now I understand EXACTLY what was bugging me about this book, and The Power of Habit, and Imagine: How Creativity Works (though, obviously, that book has plenty of issues), and lots of others. ""So, instead, here is a recipe for writing a hit popular brain book. You start each chapter with a pat anecdote about an individual’s professional or entrepreneurial success, or narrow escape from peril. You then mine the neuroscientific research for an apparently relevant specific result and narrate the experiment, perhaps interviewing the scientist involved and describing his hair. You then climax in a fit of premature extrapolation, inferring from the scientific result a calming bromide about what it is to function optimally as a modern human being. Voilà, a laboratory-sanctioned Big Idea in digestible narrative form."" (Poole, 2012)Guess I might just add a link to this article to all my reviews of these neurobabble books!"
51,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"A really interesting read about the brain and all its potential. I had been taught, like many of us, from an early age that nerves grow when you are a baby, and then stop. After that, your nerve patterns are fixed, and as the cells die you eventually fade away. That is so wrong, and this book gives many examples of the ""neuroplasticity"" that makes the brain so adaptive.Brains are constantly growing and changing, and not at all like a vessel that gets filled with memories and knowledge. ""To keep the brain alive requires learning something truly new with intense focus.""Like many books about the brain, it is filled with people who have suffered tragedies that damage parts of the brain. These are fascinating stories that give you good insight into how the brain works. There is a very hopeful message, because time and time again we see that the functions of the brain are not fixed, but in fact other parts of the brain can pick up the function of the damaged parts. It even appears that there is hope for replacing lost senses. Cochlear implants are no longer science fiction, and other senses appear to be partially or completely recoverable as well.There is a really important side of this book: brains don't just happen, and people are not just a particular intelligence level. You have grow a brain, and it can be done through exercises. What is important is that children who do not get those exercises, do not in fact grow their brains. They fall behind, and never get the chance to catch up. Anyone seriously considering to be an athlete would not question the idea that you have to do basic exercises to build up the muscles. The same, it appears, is true with the brain if you want to be able to think competitively.The book is a surprisingly easy read, especially given what might with a less skilled writer be a dense obscure topic. I found the book engaging and entertaining, the stories are personable, and the concepts explained clearly. I really enjoyed reading this very memorable book."
52,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8495289-traummachine,5,"What an amazing read! Research shows that your brain doesn't *just* have one center for, say, vision. It's neuroplastic -- if the default section of the brain is damaged, other sections will take over. Blind folks have had skin linked with the vision centers of the brain, and were able to see! Not as well as with their eyes, but they could recognize individual faces by sight. Criss-crossing the senses isn't the only thing studied. Research has shown similar results with balance, and overcoming issues after strokes.It takes a very strong commitment to teach a part of the brain to take over the functions of another. We have limited real estate in neurons, so they constantly grow and change to reinforce the behaviors we repeat the most. This is why we lose skills if we don't use them, and why developing new habits is difficult; the real estate is in high demand -- use it or lose it. It's also the reason bad habits are hard to break; we've literally wired our brains to link these habits with satisfaction, pleasure, a sense of well being, etc. The book touches on needing to link our desires and wants with good habits, in order to cause those links to decay and reinforce the new behavior. The more we use the new links, the stronger and more efficient they become in our brain, and the reverse is true of the links for the bad habits. This isn't a how-to or self-help book, but it's a great thing to think about.The author also discussed the resistance from members of the traditional school of thought. It's always interesting to me to read about scientists as political beings, or stodgy folks who are stuck in their ways and resistant to change. Seems counter to what I would expect from someone devoting their life to science.The book had a very conversational tone, made the concepts easy to understand, and I could feel the author's excitement. Very, very cool stuff, highly recommended!"
53,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369876-voracious,1,"I think I would have enjoyed this book had it not been for an off-putting experience early on.I thought one of the computer programs Doidge describes (and praises highly) might have been valuable for one of my sons. I looked for a website where I could buy it, and found it was one of those sites that sings the product's praises, but reveals nothing about how to buy it, or what it costs. Just ""give us your phone number and we'll call you"". I distrust sites like that quite a lot. Feels like an invitation to be conned.So I researched further, and found that they're charging THOUSANDS for access to the program, AND that current research has found it to be ineffective in any case.So from that point on, the book read like advertising copy to me, not like scientific reporting. Doidge waxes lyrical over many, many, profit-making enterprises which offer hope to people with neurological issues. I'm sure some of the theory described will lead to useful treatments one day, but right now, this book feels to me both dishonest and mercenary. That may be unfair to Doidge, but throughout the rest of the book, he sounded to me like a schill for researchers focused on profit rather than cures. Put me in mind of that awful French obstetrician family who kept the secret of forceps deliveries to themselves for generations, at the cost of many thousands of lives, to ensure their continuing wealth.Frankly, I doubt I'll finish this book before I have to return it to the library."
54,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5277400-andrea,4,"Good presentation of the concept of neuroplasticity for a lay audience. Each chapter has a personal story to attach a concept to - I personally found this annoying as I wanted more science and less anecdote, but I realise that for popular appeal it is necessary. Most of the concets presented were robustly supported by the evidence, but the chapters on OCD and chronic pain I thought were somewhat biased. The former was presented as overwhelmingly as an organic disorder through cherry picking of the literature, and for the latter, the ""mirror box"" proposed as a cure for all chronic pain syndrome I felt was overly simplistic and based on a selected cohort of patients.In addition, the retraining programme profiled is not the only one available - Taub via his CI programme does not have a monopoly on promoting neuroplasticity. Overall, this book is good and will hopefully improve the profile of neuroplasticity, as there is a huge legacy of belief that brain damage from stroke/injury is permanent and not amenable to re-training. Many patients are told that damage is permanent, and if family and friends pick up this book, they can encourage targeted rehabilitation with the expectation that at least some function can be regained. "
55,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34213442-mohan-eenu,3," An important book to read. I started this book with not much expectation but it did leave an impression in my mind that you never stop growing mentally. If you put this fact to good use you can achieve great heights. The Author coins the term neuroplasticity - the ability of brain to reorganize itself and form new neural connections throughout one's life.There's a known fact that your brain structure changes as you learn new things. The notion of the author is to help us understand the fundamental nature of brain which is growing as you feed it with information and training. This is not easy also not impossible. Various research and experiments were held upon this field of neuroplasticity. The rate at which the brain transforms is incredible. There are numerous illustrations and success stories of the experiments that were performed on individuals once thought their life is the way it is. Artificial sensors, electrodes, and many more inventions that led to this concept of neuroplasticity. The author says we can make any organ work that is affected by brain damage. People can have their own life.Pretty interesting book and a good one to read to understand the way of the brain. I strongly recommend this book for reading."
56,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130454-donna,5,"A literally life-changing book, The Brain That Changes Itself uses case studies of people who have suffered brain injury to illustrate how the brain changes throughout life, adapting to new conditions with amazing speed and efficiency. This is the kind of book that, while you’re reading it, seems relevant to every conversation and experience. I happened to be reading it while taking a long-anticipated vacation. For months, I’ve imagined each stop along the way. Now, confronted with the real rather than imagined locations, I’ve almost been able to feel neurological connections withering away as old “memories” are replaced with new, more correct ones. Now that I’ve experienced them, I can no longer remember how I imagined that our stops along the way would be.It’s reassuring to know that the plasticity of the brain affords us the possibility of a lifetime of learning and constructive change. For some, it may also be something of a burden to know that there are no excuses at any age—change is always possible. Also, there’s a certain amount of responsibility involved in knowing that the brain is subject to the same basic law as the body: use it or lose it."

58,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/888868-hannah-crowther,4,"This was a fascinating book discussing the human brain's incredible potential for change -- called plasticity. As I read it, I felt like I was reading about the beginnings of a huge revolution in our understanding of what the brain is capable of and how to cure disorders of the brain. I felt like I was also able to correct some of my outdated knowledge. For example, the brain does grow new neurons -- you're not born with all you will have for the rest of your life. Also, there are not strict areas of the brain devoted to certain functions. For example, if you become blind, the area of the brain devoted to sight can be utilized for different functions, such as hearing. The brain is like valuable real estate--if it's not used by one function, it will be taken over for use for another purpose: the use it or lose it principle. It was also interesting to learn about some of the new techniques that have been developed based on brain plasticity, such as what is being done to help the blind, stroke patients, the elderly, children with mental impairments, and others. "
59,067003830X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"I have to admit that this is one of the best books I have read in a long long time and goes into my top 10 all-time list. The books is about the brain and neuroplasticity. In simple terms it says that the brain isn’t a hard wired and fixed entity which is fixed after your youth but can be changed in the face of the greatest damage done to it. The book gets incredibly interesting near the end especially when it talks about culture and the brain and some of the concepts that it points out are mind-blowingly and mouth-wateringly amazing. Its full of anecdotes and small experiments some of which you can try out yourself and cannot resist to do just that. The books covers areas such as building a better brain, redesigning your brain, acquiring tastes and love, stroke victims moving again, unlocking your brain, pain, imagination, turning our ghosts into our ancestors, rejuvenation, more than the sum of its parts, the culturally modified brain and plasticity and progress. Massively recommended. "
