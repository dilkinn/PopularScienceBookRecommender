0,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1883816-barbara-h,4,"As a cat lover and owner, I have several books in my library devoted to either the care of these enigmatic animals, to their history and distributions in the world. Desmond Morris is a noted anthropologist, who has penned this neat little book devoted to the life and behaviors of the domesticated cat. He has answered many questions which are common and some one may not have thought about.For example:Why does a cat trample on your lap with its front paws? Why does a cat wag its tail? Why does a cat roll over to lie on its back when greeting you? Why does a cat chatter its teeth when it sees a bird through a window? Why do we say ""He let the cat out of the bag!""? And More...For the answers to these questions do read this book!"
1,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12558730-m-m-strawberry-library-reviews,4,A pretty fun book for cat lovers. Read with Catlore by the same author.
2,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,3,It was a good introduction to cats but as a long time cat lover most of the facts in the book I already knew. I had hoped for something a little more academic or something that went into greater depth on the social interactions of those colonies of semi-feral cats. I know Morris has taken part in those studies but Catwatching doesn't touch on it (except briefly in the introduction). The illustrations though are wonderful. 
3,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57158143-bibliovoracious,1,"After dipping in a couple of times my eyes were tired from rolling - SO anachronistic (scientists cannot allow possibility of animals experiencing feelings or reason), dripping in condescension (for cats and the reader), and far too smugly self-amused (bad jokes). However, I read the whole thing, and while all of the above is also true, I did learn a couple of things (Hairless Sphynx cats are from CANADA? wtf?! What kind of maladapted accident is THAT?), and there were a few cat funnies too that made me laugh.There's better cat books out there. This is a time capsule, and/or D. Morris cranking out another book to capitalize on his fifteen of fame"

5,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5668541-jack-oughton,4,"A short and surprisingly entertaining read.Though I do not have a cat, I now know things about cats that I never once knew that I would know :3"
6,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87969341-andriy-zinchuk,5,"THis short book finally brought some peace to my chaotic household. We had two young cats (brothers) who, while lovable and entertaining, were completely out of control and not responding to any of the behavior modification tips I usually used with cats. After being disappointed by at least 5 other cat behavior books, I was skeptical about this one.Catwatching helped me understand that cats respond to positive reinforcement, punishment will only make them neurotic. Catch them doing the right thing and praise, praise, praise! i.e.: anytime he uses the scratching post I say ""Good kitty!"" and use his name- they quickly learned that good things happen at the scratching post and use it more often. When they're climbing the curtains, distract them with a toy rather than punishing. You'll get farther. Don't' use a treat, that's rewarding bad behavior.I also learned cat body language that was very helpful, such as blowing a quick breath of air into the face of a cat who has gone crazy on your hand/feet/etc. Stops them immediately. Putting a few fingers not their forehead and pushing lightly says ""enough of that"".Following Morris' lead, I watched how they communicated with each other and followed suit. They were still hyperactive acrobats until they were for years old (and we had to cat-proof much of the house), but this book helped me immensely. Only one I found that has.I recommend it without reservation!"

8,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52714775-robin,4,"Some of the author's explanations for feline behavior appear to be based on conjecture, but who better to speculate than one who has spent time working with and observing wild cats in a zoo setting? This book helped me respect the cat's remarkable instincts and adaptability and to understand how my interactions w/ kitty while well-intentioned are more based on my own needs than hers. The book's question and answer format is accompanied by simple sketches that convey character and speak to the distinguished bearing of its subject. Its effects whet the reader's appetite for further education of the animal world and of nature in general."

Now I deleted all the books I had of Goodreads (it is actually easier because I am giving away a huge amount of books). I am now going through my diary and putting books back.April 17, 2018- Finish a book call Catwatching. The last chapter was how cat owners live longer. At 3:30 am all the cats were noisy.

12,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16327398-ahmed-halawa,5,Super easy read. Makes me admire my cats more and try to understand them better. 
13,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67063925-mary-t,2,The beginning and end of the book were quite vacuous but there were some interesting tidbits on cat behavior in the middle.
14,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90282517-tom-pokorn,5,I recommend this title for everyone who wants to know how their fluffy friends behave when they aren't home.
15,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491184-julie-rylie,3,"I pretentiously started to read this book thinking I knew everything I needed to know about cats but of course I was wrong, and the curious stuff I could learn, are the following:- Cats scratch on sofas/ carpets, chairs bla bla to strip off the old worn-out claw shealths to reveal the new claws beneath;- If a cat rolls over on his belly for you he is saying ""I trust you enough to adopt this vulnerable posture in your presence"";- Feces burying is the act of a subordinate cat, fearul of it's social standing. A study discovered that tom cats, far from burying their feces, actually placed them on little ""advertising"" hillocks. (my cat Isolda does not cover her feces and I always thought it was because she doesn't have one eye so she doesn't have much perception of how to do it, but after all no, she just has balls ahahah, but jokes aside, this is quite weird because I don't have a dominant cat, I strongly belive my cats live in an equality based environment. They are too sweet to be dominant);- Allogrooming between two adult cats doesn't have to do with mutual hygiene but the cementing of the friendly relation that exists between them (woooooohhhhhh they love eachother so much <3 - i knew it!);- The feline hiss is a case of protective mimicry. The cat imitates the snake to give an enemy the impression that it too is venomous and dangerous (now that's weird); - Cats give freshly caught prey to their owners because they think they are hopeless hunters (lol);- A quick flick of the tongue over the lips is one of the telltale signs that a cat is becoming agitated, while at the same time being fasinated or puzzled by something;- Cats love catnip because they are junkies (? lol). It gives them a drug trip which produces similar states of ecstasy but is nocive to your cat;A special study in the US revealed that, for those whose stress has led to heart trouble, the owning of a cat may literally make a difference between life and death, reducing the blood pressure and calming the overworker heart."
16,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664392-richard,3,"This slender book is a quick read, with plenty of ""fun facts"" about cats. The book was written way back in 1986, by a British author, so it doesn't completely resonate with an American cat owner in 2018. Desmond Morris seems to assume that all cats, including pet cats, spend time outdoors. He doesn't account for the strictly indoor cat. I don't know if that's a U.K. thing, or a 1986 thing, or both. He also mentions several times that a cat who is nine or ten years old is likely near the end of its life, and indicates that the cat who advances to its late teens is exceptional. I have to wonder if some of the science is also dated, if there have been new discoveries or insights about feline behavior in the last 32 years that would contradict the material in this book.However, assuming that most of the material is still accurate, it's interesting to read about cats' body language, behavior, and physical abilities. Since I read Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know by Alexandra Horowitz I've been wanting to read a similar book about cats. This isn't quite what I was looking for, but I'm still glad I read it.Next, I'd like to find a book about humans that my dog and my two cats can read, so that they can get a better understanding of me and the other human members of my family."
17,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8718241-john,4,"All the essential questions about your cat's behavior are summarized in this excellent feline foray. I got it off the 10 cent rack at the local library near our home. It looked a little thin as it is laid out in a brief chapter format while answering all those pesky questions about the cat. For example: Why does a cat purr? Why does a cat chatter it's teeth when it sees a a bird through the window? Why is a female cat called a queen? Don't be fooled by the format, this is a worthwhile guide for the cat lover.Desmond Morris is best known for his book ""The Naked Ape"", but he was also the head of London's Zoo, a TV personality and scientific popularizer in Britain, and surrealist artist  http://www.desmond-morris.com/dm_art/ . This book demonstrates his incredible powers of observation. One factoid I can't resist is that a male feral cat has a territory of 150 to 175 acres. In city cat territorial terms, this area could support 12,500 cats! "
18,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300093-bookworm-amir,4,"This book was great to learn more about the itsy-bitsy's of cat behaviour which, as a cat owning family, we thought we knew much but this book expanded our knowledge.Everything from why does it purr, why do they come to our laps, what's with the playing and flipping of the ball, why can they seem to be 'cruel' when they've caught prey, and to their courtship and (crazy) mating acts, the history of their domestication and lots, lots more. Just as we read books on people's body language, this is the book for cat's - I know treat and understand my cat much better. Recommended reading for those who own these feline animals!Oh, and I realized that there's also another book in the series...Peoplewatching. Now, now, ain't it'll be interesting to know more about these two-legged species? ;)"
19,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331397-felicity-terry,5,"A hardback 'coffee-table' sized read of a book published by Edbury Press Ltd in 1994 which as far as I can ascertain is no longer in print though second-hand copies are available. As beautiful to look at as it is interesting to read, if ever there was a book guaranteed to have cat lovers swooning this is it.A beautifully photographed book which answers many a question posed by cat lovers the world over (just why are cats attracted to those who 'dislike' them? Do they have ESP and can they predict an earthquake? Why do we say its raining cats and dogs?) albeit sometimes a bit too simply - those wanting more in-depth explanations might be disappointed but for your average 'crazy cat person' and especially those wanting an introduction into feline behaviour this is purrfect.Copyright: Tracy Terry @ Pen and Paper."
20,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1460563-mary,5,There's not much you can say about this book that the subtitle 'The Essential Guide to Cat Behaviour' doesn't tell you. It's a fascinating read for cat lovers. You may know some of the reasons behind some of your cat's behaviour. There's bound to be the answer to more than question you've had at the back of your mind for years though.I flew through this in a couple of hours. It's a pretty short book with no flannel. Just explanations for why cats do what they do.It's a pretty old book. So I'm unsure as to whether it would still be seen as totally accurate. I'm sure some of what is given as explanation is opinion based on his long years of experience. Maybe views of parts of it have changed. It's not a cat care manual just a very interesting look at felines. 
21,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4093755-jasper,4,"One thing is for sure, I have never ever known this much about cats before.This book has taught me so many things about cats and has corrected many of the things I had thought about cats before I read this book.For instance, I had always thought cats purred when they were contented but it turns out it's because it ""Signals a friendly social mood.""Now I watch our cat in a whole different way.Now I watch her and I always know what she is doing and why she is doing it.It wasn't exactly a book you could give five stars to I must admit.Not that I didn't absolutely like it but a five star book in my opinion has to be completely ""amazing"" all the way through.Many of the things about cats in this book were ""amazing"" but a few things were not.  "
22,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2659688-david-bonesteel,4,"An interesting and concise explanation of many facets of cat behavior, organized into brief question and answer sections that make for easy reference and quick reading. Desmond Morris illuminates many fascinating aspects of feline hunting and mating behavior, as well as providing insights into their body language. The book may lack some scientific rigor in that Morris sometimes speculates on issues of cat motivation for which he has no experimental or statistical support (or at least none that he mentions), but it is clear that he respects these animals, takes them seriously, and bases his conclusions on many hours of observation. Recommended. "
23,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7225766-j-k,4,"An older book, lots of these facts I sort of knew - possbily from reading it when we got our first kitty in the early 1980s - but lots of things I'd forgotten or didn't know about at all - like that flipping play that cats do when they toss a toy in the air actually comes from their latent fishing abilities, or that American cats pluck their caught birds in a very different technique to those from the 'old world'. All fascinating, small chunks of cat knowledge from a man who spent a lot of time watching and trying to understand them. I can only imagine what he'd have made of Grumpy cat and Little Bub and the enormous feline presence available for study on YouTube."
24,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22862523-ana,4,"This short and fairly interesting read is everything a (new) cat person should know about those magnificent creatures. It's a great entry-level guide through your favourite companion's behaviour. It does as it promises in the introduction, no more, no less. Although I was aware of most of the things presented in the book, new and exciting facts were plentiful. The only thing that bothered me is the fact that even though the author mentions giving cow milk to cats, he never actually warns the reader of the potential damage it might do. Also, cats running amok after defecating was never explained. I was really looking forward to that. "
25,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468895-faith-reidenbach,5,"Desmond Morris is a zoologist who has worked with big cats, and he also admires domesticated cats, having watched them for hours on his boyhood farm. This book about housecats is written in Q&A format, which makes it easy to select the content that interests you. Why do cats bring their prey to humans? Is it really meant as a gift? Why do they want to come inside practically as soon as they go outside? Why do they purr? Each chapter has short, clearly written answers. Recommended for everyone who wants to be a better friend to a cat."
26,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2173681-jael,4,"In Catwatching, Morris explains in a question and answer format why cats do the things they do. I think all cat enthusiasts should read it, it's a very interesting book. Although, on the segment of ""Why do we speak of someone 'Having Kittens'?"" Morris wonders why no other animal usage is used. Maybe at the time the book was written, it wasn't a popular phrase, but I knew of having kittens but it was rarely used. Instead 'having a cow' was more popular. It makes me curious how that one came about...Plus, I have to admit I almost died laughing at cats 'sex soap opera drama'."
27,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6193138-skyqueen,4,"Oops...forgot to rate this one I finished a week or so ago. So far not up to my usual reading pace. Too much dang life happening and not necessarily the good kind. So it was nice to read this short little book answering all the questions you've always had about cats and then some!! Turns out they are way smarter than dogs...we knew that, ahem, but also have suffered unnecessarily. Amazing facts even dog lovers should read! Recommend. But probably hard to find. BTW he also has a ""Dogwatching"" edition. "
28,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5546147-richard,3,"A nice book for any cat lover. No matter how complete you may think your knowledge of cats to be, there are bound to be a few new facts here to intrigue you. It's also an easy-to-access reference for pretty much any cat lore that you might want to brush up on. But because it is organized with a simple question and answer format, it's not a book that you really want to settle down and enjoy - it's more a book to set next to the crapper, or put on your ereader to pass a few minutes on the bus."
29,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11197684-jim-berkin,5,"A must for everyone owned by their cat, analyzing and explaining various forms of typical cat behavior. Of course, all of us who love cats know that each one of 'em have behaviors that no one can ever explain, such as my cat waking me at 3AM this morning with loud meows, just so she could show me that she wanted to go into the bathroom & jump in the dry tub and start purring. Explain THAT, Desmond Morris!"
30,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,3,An easily read book on what makes a cat tick...or more accurately purr. It's a nice little reference book structured with questions and answers on almost any area of cat behavior. Now I know why my cats leave dead mice on the door step and why they make that weird chattering sound when they watch birds.
31,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855510-angela-maher,5,"Not a big book, but a gem of a book filled with information you don't see elsewhere. Even I learned things from this book, despite having a zoology degree of my own, and having lived in close proximity to my cat for the last decade. This book will renew your appreciation of what wonderful creatures cats are, and you will probably find yourself watching them even more closely."
32,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781908-steve,3,"If you are a cat person, this is an enjoyable book to read. It helps you understand why your cat does what it does. Some of it seemed a bit speculative, but the speculations made sense. I skipped chapters on the bits of our cat's life that she never enjoyed because we had her spayed. But it's a quick read and divided into useful sections like a large FAQ."
33,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/985960-alena,5,"I love Desmond Morris; he has a really accessible style and he explains things really well. He did not fail me in this brilliant book, which explains many questions related to cat behavior.I found it easy to read and hard to put down.. I read it in a couple of hours. :)"

35,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870386-karen-eichelberger,0,"This is a very good book about cats written by a scientist. I recommend it for anyone who has a cat, has had a cat in the past or may have a cat in the future. The same author has written another book about dogs."
36,0091883113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10610343-hrishi,4,"Excellent read from the master of behavioral descriptions and hypotheses. My only complaint would be that it is too short, and isn't as rigorous as Morris' 'Naked Ape' was about human behavior (blame the q&a format). Still worthwhile"
