The general idea of Banach-Tarski Theorem is that you can make an infinite number of infinities out of just one infinity. So you can split the ""mother"" infinity in to several infinities of the same size as the mother infinity. Or, in other words, you can rearrange the points of a small object (as small as a pea) to get a bigger object (as big as the sun).The book is interesting and funny. However, it wasn't very well-written. I've struggled though it, because the language was really weak and the sentences were too long sometimes.If you have no idea about the Banach-Tarski Theorem, I think this book is a good choice to start with."
1,1568812132,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16958-dan,4,"This book is about the Banach-Tarski Theorem. This was a Mathematical result from the twenties that said there is a way to take apart a solid ball in a finite number of pieces and then twist and turn around the pieces, and then reassemble them into two balls of the same mass and volume. This is all mathematically speaking, of course, so it doesn't mean you can do it in real life.The proof is presented well, and it provides a lot of background. It is not rigorous, but I definitely now how to do the proof rigorously now.I liked the author's writing style. I thought it was clear and understandable. It wasn't so slow that I was bored. And I have seen all the mathematics in this book before. This leads me to believe that for non-mathematicians this book may be hard to read. But that is just really hard for me to judge. I think this book would be best for non-mathematician scientists who have lots of mathematical background.The author also discusses the different schools of mathematical thought and goes into the details of the different mathematical philosophies. I think he did a good job at this.Towards the end of the book the author goes into a rather lengthy discussion of how quantum physicists try to incorporate this theorem into their work. It was interesting but seemed a little lame and speculative to me. The author concludes by saying that the advanced mathematical tools that we have, end up heavily influencing physicists."

Lying in my bed trying to go sleep I was looking out into room illuminated with a small night light at the door I started to think and perceive the concept of size. The door across from my bed seemed immensely large one moment then infinitesimally small the next moment. I thought about the world being infinitely large and being infinitely small at the same time and how everything was made of an infinity of pieces. Anyway, Cantor explored the infinite mathematically and demonstrated that there were infinitely many infinities each infinitely larger at each level and the smallest infinity is the natural numbers going on forever. The continuum is one of the problematic parts of his set theory. The continuum was shown to be a larger infinity the infinity of natural numbers but was it merely the second smallest infinity or were there levels in between these two infinities. The continuum which I had an experience of staring at my dimly lit door in my bedroom at age seven would cause problems such as the Banach-Tarski paradox where a sphere made up of an infinite number of pieces can make two of the same sized spheres each with an infinity of points. Rinse and repeat and you can make as many of such spheres out of the original as you wish. That disorienting night with the idea of the continuum is something Math has been struggling with for the past century. Reality is weird when you drill down into it. The book gives a good demonstration of the proof of the mathematical paradox and gently introduces the reader to the paradoxes of the infinite. I learned the proof in grad school but ever since my experience as a seven-year old I have always been a sucker for the infinite."

4,1568812132,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16515235-neal-alexander,3,"The Banach-Tarski theorem states that a ball (i.e. a solid sphere) can be split into countably many pieces and re-assembled into another ball of different radius. Like the author, as a maths student I was unsettled by this result, as were many others: according to an obituary of Tarski, an Illinois citizen once demanded that the state legislature outlaw its teaching.The paradoxical nature of the theorem lies in our wanting to infer from mathematics to the physical world. While this is valid for many mathematical results, here it is not, because the axioms used to construct the theorem allow physically unrealistic sets to exist (in a Platonic sense). In particular, the “measure” of a three-dimensional set (such as a ball) corresponds to the volume, but some sets are non-measurable, and this is the kind of set into which the theorem divides the ball. In other words, the pieces of the original ball don’t have defined volumes. The culprit is the axiom of choice. Without it, there are no unmeasurable sets. (This is shown, albeit with a caveat, by something called the Solovay model.) Bertrand Russell’s explanation of the axiom of choice may be the best: from an infinite series of pairs of shoes, you can specify a rule to choose one from each pair; but how can you do that for an infinite series of pairs of socks? The axiom of choice simply asserts that there always is such a rule. Paradox (etymologically “beyond belief”) can be a tricky concept to pin down. The author distinguishes three types: 1) statements which offend common sense but are true, 2) those which appear true but are self-contradictory, i.e. fallacies, and 3) those which lead to contradictory conclusions, known as antinomies. The Banach-Tarski theorem is an example of the first type: the reasoning is correct, and any objection has to be with the premises (axioms). Russell’s paradox, and the related Burali-Forti paradox, are of the third kind: they assert sets whose existence leads to contradictions. This is avoided by modern set theories which constrains the kind of set that can be defined. In fact, the main set theory in current use was jointly specified by Zermelo, the same person who made the axiom of choice explicit.The grand plan of the book is to take the reader right through from first principles to a proof of the Banach-Tarski theorem. This is ambitious but seems to be achieved. Although my main interest lay in the history and interpretation of the theorem. I didn’t need to be convinced that the proof was valid, nor was I really interested in exactly how it was proved. (I already knew that, for example, that the set of real numbers can be 1-1 related with certain of its subsets.)The publishing is let down by an idiosyncratic mix of fonts, clip art style illustrations and slack editing, e.g. MC Escher drawings, and the lyrics to “Hotel Infinity”, a pastiche of the Eagles song. I didn’t see any mathematical errors, although some of the material seems unnecessary, e.g. matrix formulations of symmetries, and relativistic time dilation. "

Come to think of it, the only exposition of the Banach-Tarski paradox I've ever seen. Not so hard mathematics that prove you can disassemble a pea into 5 or more pieces and reassemble them into a sphere the size of the sun."
