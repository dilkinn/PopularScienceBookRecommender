0,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5843489-elliot,1,"I've been a fan of Dr. Duckworth and her research since long before she became famous, so it's hard to overstate my disappointment with this title. The fundamental problem with the book is that instead of writing a popularization aimed at the intellectual/policy market, she decided to cash out with a different type of book aimed at the (larger) self-help/business market. The problem with this approach is that the self-help market doesn't want to learn about limits: they want the secret to success. And so Duckworth ends up having to sell her ""grit"" mantra as the secret to success, with unlimited power to overcome all obstacles.At one point, Duckworth tells the story of a waitress who rolled up her sleeves and learned to work every job in the restaurant as needed and got promoted to general manager of the restaurant and now runs a Fortune 500 company. I can tell another story, where a waitress learned to work every job in the restaurant, but management gave the general manager job to the son of the regional vice president. Or the economy went south and the restaurant closed. Or she couldn't give the job anywhere near 100% because her child developed cancer. Or any of the multitude of shitty things that happen in life that are totally beyond any individual's control.There's no room for my waitress in Duckworth's universe. Duckworth silently defines her out of existence. But in the real world, there are a lot more copies of my waitress than of Duckworth's.Of course, Duckworth never outright *says* that grit has unlimited power to produce success, or that my waitress's failure to become a Fortune 500 CEO is her own fault. In fact, Duckworth explicitly denies it. But the book is written in such a way that grit without success is presented only as a theoretical possibility, to be noted and then ignored. The message ends up being that anyone can achieve unlimited success by demonstrating enough grit, and if it doesn't work then all you need to do is demonstrate even more grit. Which is exactly what the self-help/business audience wants to hear: people have unlimited power to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and the people who are at the top of society because they are just better people.The explicitly-denied-but-much-more-strongly-implied apologia for an imagined meritocracy is further underlined by her fawning portrayal of James Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Dimon's predictably self-serving claims about his management style and the corporate culture of JP Morgan Chase are taken at face value, with no interrogation at all.It's quite unfortunate that Duckworth decided to push the presentation of her research in this direction, because her actual research is very good and a popularization that presented her research in a balanced way could have been excellent."
1,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,2,It was hard to pay attention to or stick with because most of the chapters seemed the same.But perhaps I haven't learned enough grittiness yet.
2,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa,5,"I remember when I started writing my PhD thesis. I had this vague idea of being a fraud, as I knew I wasn't a genius, and I believed that to achieve academic excellence, you needed to be one.  There were many other students who seemed endlessly more talented than I was, who were creative and came up with brilliant suggestions. To top it all off, they had all the time in the world whereas I juggled being a mum of babies and toddlers and doing the research at the same time.And yet, I finished my thesis. Many others did not. Back then I was astounded, as it seemed such an odd contradiction. Why had they not persevered, when they so obviously had all the talent and time in the world? And why had I done it eventually, despite banging my head against the wall many, many times, and despite thinking that the thesis itself was a product of multiple mistakes that I took the effort to correct as best I could?With hindsight, a decade and a half later, and well into another career as a teacher of adolescents and a mother of teenagers, I believe what I developed back then was a good dose of grit, that stuff that makes you reach your potential because you make sure to keep the engine going.Angela Duckworth' book is both enlightening and readable, and it may guide parents, teachers, coaches, leaders towards building a culture of believing in a growth mindset in Carol Dweck's definition. What it takes to be successful is a combination of four quite straight forward things:Discover Your Passion - it all starts with interest!Deliberate Practice - it is not only the quantity of the time you are willing to spend on a topic, but also the quality of that time that counts a thousandfold!Purpose - we're humans, we want meaning in our lives, and we want to believe that what we do makes a difference, to ourselves and to those we care about!Hope - we have to be able to imagine a positive outcome, no matter how often we fail to achieve it. If we can't see a shimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, we won't move forwards.Grit is about combining those things, setting an overarching goal that creates meaning for us, and being able to follow through with it, no matter what. It is about having priorities and being honest and self-reflective. It is about valuing life enough to want to make the most of it.It's teaching and parenting in a nutshell!"
3,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10510126-brandon,3,"Ultimately, there's not much new in this latest entry in the personal improvement genre. I had high hopes for this book, initially believing that it would have new (to me) insights along the lines of what I found in Carol Dweck's book ""Mindset"" and Charles Duhigg's ""The Power of Habit."" Sadly, this book falls quite flat with entirely too much repetition of a singular topic.If you want a tl;dr version of the book, it comes down to this: don't give up. When you are going through hell, keep going. If you quit, no one will care, and you will always know.Two of those quotes aren't mine. One is Churchill, the other is Cmdr. John Collins.Duckworth presents that as an individual, your future success is less gated by innate talent, and more reliant on your ability to see things through. She puts forth that for an individual to develop grit, they must endeavor to partake in an exercise in which they have interest, can practice, have passion, and hope of doing well.The singular idea of 'grit' is an interesting one to inspect, but this book ends up feeling like more of a pop psychology exercise in self reflection than anything truly profound. She's clearly very wise on her research, but if you are looking for something that is actionable and likely to cause you to change your behaviors, look elsewhere."
4,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4734912-jason,3,"This book may be the first to employ the humblebrag as a rhetorical device. Roughly: ""My dad always told me I was no genius. Then I won a MacArthur Fellowship 'Genius Grant' on my research showing that hard work is more crucial to success than genius."" It's a little boastful, as are the author's numerous references to her Ivy League education and her consultant work with McKinsey (who apparently only hire based on intellect) and, most of all, her namedropping, but it all works well in supporting her larger claims that talent is overrated, that fixed mindsets often result in complacency and/or learned helplessness, and that grit is something that can be acquired at any time by virtually anybody.In the process of developing these claims, Duckworth looks at grit-based success in the military, sports, the country of Finland, and, most of all, in the classroom. The best section of the book looks at graduation commencement speech tropes that encourage young people to ""do what [they] love"" rather than acknowledging that finding what one loves can be a long process. Her approach is anecdotal much like Malcolm Gladwell's in his various mononymous pop psychology works, and the results are similarly enjoyable. There's also useful advice for teachers and parents on how to encourage grit and growth mindsets in children although it does occasionally veer uncomfortably close to Tiger Mom authoritarianism (Note: I'm not referencing Duckworth's Chinese lineage here; she herself invokes Amy Chua at one point in the book). I do have one gripe with methodology, but I'll allow that this is likely addressed in Duckworth's more academic publications (I'm a lowly state university educated plebeian, after all). In summarizing her findings that predictions of academic success based on talent are less reliable than her own grit scale, she repeatedly uses high school grades and SAT scores to quantify talent, which again is less important to success than resilience and passion. I get it, but I'm not sure that grades and scores aren't themselves potentially measurements of grit rather than talent. Certainly, many people achieve high SAT and ACT scores and great GPAs after working hard, taking practice tests, meeting with private tutors, etc. There's nothing here explaining how this is reconciled, which to me leaves a bit of hole, but it doesn't diminish what is otherwise an informative and enjoyable book."
5,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"What a fascinating book! I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this research on how important effort and perseverance is in being successful. Duckworth calls this grit, and has tests for measuring how gritty a person is in his or her projects. Her findings are that ""natural talent"" is helpful, of course, but effort matters more.I've heard about grit research in relation to education, and how grittier students tend to do better in school. But grit applies to more than just getting good grades or how many degrees you can earn -- you can think about it in terms of whatever hobby or career you are passionate about. Duckworth also talks about gritty people feeling as if they have a core mission or purpose to their life, and I was inspired by this chapter to write my own mission, and it's positively affected how I think about my work. I highly recommend this book to those interested in education, psychology or personal growth.Favorite Quote""You can grow your grit 'from the inside out': You can cultivate your interests. You can develop a habit of daily challenge-exceeding-skill practice. You can connect your work to a purpose beyond yourself. And you can learn to hope when all seems lost. You can also grow your grit 'from the outside in.' Parents, coaches, teachers, bosses, mentors, friends -- developing your personal grit depends critically on other people."""
6,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,2,"Disappointed to read this in the acknowledgments:""First and foremost, I want to thank my collaborators. I wrote this book in the first-person singular, using ""I"" when, in fact, pretty much everything I've done as a researcher or writer was accomplished by a plurality. The ""we"" who deserve credit -- in particular coauthors on published research -- are named individually in Notes. On their behalf, I extend a heartfelt thanks to our research teams who, collectively, made this research possible.""Wow, way to bury the gratitude and acknowledgment of people who are your research coauthors!Also, looks like there are several challenges to the importance/influence of Grit. See this NPR story: http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/0...According to that story, Duckworth is thinking about revising her ""grit scale,"" specifically the questions around passion. "
7,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,3,"Saying, ""I really wanted to like this book"" would be an understatement. I started it expecting a 5-star read. I agreed with the premise and was eager to learn more. However, this book fell short for me. The first half read too much like a self-help book. ""Be gritty! You'll be successful!"" The second half had more of the academic analysis I craved but it still lacked the depth I was looking for. This might be a good intro for the importance of work ethic, follow through, and an internal locus of control, but it didn't expand beyond what I already knew. It added new stories and studies to my understanding but I still would have liked more. I saw one review critique this book for focusing rather narrowly on American success stories, a culture and environment that differs greatly from many parts of the world. After all, we call it ""the American dream."" I'd like to see this analyzed more. Does ""grit"" fit success in China or India or Ethiopia? Can you use grit to measure societies where people are struggling for clean drinking water or surviving civil war? What needs to be in place alongside grit for people to succeed? Opportunity? A free market? Something else? I'm genuinely curious about the broader, philosophical underpinnings of a society that fosters grit. Duckworth spends a long portion of the second half discussing how you can develop gritty kids. She focuses on the importance of extracurricular activities. She briefly references the gap in grit for students depending on their socioeconomic status. I would have liked more analysis of this because it was something I was struggling with throughout the entire discussion. It is one thing to tell parents to enroll their kids in ballet and soccer and piano, but all those things cost money. Unless you have two parents with full-time jobs and only one or two kids, affording the sort of extra-curricular activities she references is nearly impossible. These two areas are just examples of a broader analysis I want to see - how much is Duckworth's study of ""grit"" limited to a certain entitled, well-to-do section of modern American society? Is this study practical or necessary outside of a white-collar bubble? At any other point in history, would this emphasis on developing follow through seem ridiculous to people trying to make enough to survive? I do like the brief discussion on the importance of culture and gritty environments in sports and businesses. I would have liked more focus on this as well.This is a good book, but it is too general. I would like to see more details about the practicality of grit outside of the NFL and Ivy League schools. Is this useful outside of building up an otherwise entitled generation of American kids or helping business people “be gritty! Be successful!”?"
8,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28699736-rayhan,2,"Trivial and littered with shameless self-promotion and self-adulation. Duckworth isn't so much a grit paragon as she is a paragon of privilege. There are painful moments where she pays lip-service to socioeconomic and racial diversity issues that clearly interfere with her measurements of 'grit', as she narrowly defines it. People may find her book and research inspiring because it draws you away from fixating on talent as the key determinant of success. However, both her analysis of success and prescription to be grittier is incomplete. Grit can manifest in many ways that do not show up in neither occupational achievement, or her favored measurements of it. I would hazard to guess that a large portion of the population must be necessarily gritty in order just to survive. For the privileged (likely most of her readership), her research could make sense, but for many others, her recommendations will come across as disingenuous."

“There’s a vast amount of research on what happens when we believe a student is especially talented. We begin to lavish extra attention on them and hold them to higher expectations. We expect them to excel, and that expectation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

 I'm not giving this such a high rating because I'm totally sold on the premise or her research. Her theory has been challenged by other studies with equally intriguing findings which suggest that grit is not a trait that can be easily influenced because it's mostly determined by genetics while Duckworth claims that it's something that can be learned and trained. They also suggest there are so many more factors that influence someone's success while she chose to focus on this one specifically. Her book is heavy with anecdotal evidence from successful people from the US, which is a first world country offering privileges some people can only dream of, so you could say her samples are pretty skewed because the people she mentions already have a head start even people that were initially underprivileged simply because they later have access to opportunities which in other places are basically nonexistent. However, I did find a lot of value in this book, I do feel more inspired and hopeful. It might be a placebo, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that much to me. Having grown-up in an environment that placed so much emphasis on natural intelligence and talents, I was taught to always stick to what I'm immediately good at, avoid failure at all costs (because failure is something inherently bad) and other elements of a closed mindset. Based on my experience and that of the people around me, I realized this kind of thinking was detrimental to our development and throughout the years I've learned that people are so much more adaptable and can achieve so much more when they simply try harder and they believe they can make it, which is the opposite of what I've been taught to believe. Ironically, the easiest way to fail is to simply not try because you fear failure. I don't necessarily think that grit the is main/only reason behind someone's success (what I mean by success is the achievement of one's personal goals whatever these may be, I'm not talking about the standard version of success: money and fame) but I do think it helps a lot. It feels that it should be common sense that applying grit (read as perseverance when odds seem to be against you) can only bring someone a step closer to what to what they want to accomplish. And even if it turns out to be true, that grit is mostly determined by genes, how could it hurt to try improving it, even if just by a little. Life can be unpredictable, messy, unfair but to give up on improving as a person and improving the quality of your life just because you were handed a certain genetic makeup is just adding to the unfairness of it all. I wish I'd learned this earlier."
10,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"What an inspiring and very well written book! Human beings love magic, the idea of a gift, natural talent and to be swept off their feet by a stunning piece of music or witnessing a person doing something no one has ever managed to do before. We like to believe that there is an innate natural gift that allows some people to stand out of the crowd. Yet, the author of this book suggests that she 'is yet to meet a Nobel laureate or Olympic champion who says that what they achieved came in any other way' ... than with being 'especially gritty'. Using a plethora of fascinating case studies, she concludes that 'as much as talent counts, effort counts twice'. This tells me that encouraging children and adults to be gritty, to follow their passion while embracing the fact that 'to be gritty is to fall down seven times and rise eight' is far more important than overemphasizing talent. Furthermore, perseverance is very much part of the path to reach a goal. She does not deny that natural talents exist but that at the end of the day, the aim is not to be the next Mozart, Dickens or Usain Bolt but rather to learn to put significant effort in what you like so that you reach your personal potential which is so much richer and wider than most of us believe. "

12,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,2,"Honestly, I hoped for more.I picked this book up thinking it would be inspiring; that it would motivate me to find my own grit and understand new ideas about how resilience plays a role in becoming a more successful person.Then I read This Review and began to worry. I hoped I would interpret this book differently, find some kernel to hold onto that would make this a worthy read. Unfortunately, Andy has pretty much nailed it.So much of this book seems obvious, and so many times it felt like the author was reaching. Like she's been comissioned to write this book so now not only does she have to come up with unique, fascinating concepts but there's also a decent word count to meet. I just got so bored with it.Here's the breakdown:- Hard work and determination outweigh talent when it comes to succeeding- Hard work is more likely to occur when there is interest in the work- The work is more likely to be interesting if you feel it has purpose- If you feel your work has purpose you're much more likely to stick at itThen there are countless anecdotes about successful people working hard with purpose.I enjoyed the 'Grit' questionairre, but it's vague and misleading; the first time I did it, I considered the questions generally. My grit score is quite low, because I'm one of those people who drifts from one interest to another. I don't stick with something that bores me, or makes me unhappy. I did it a second time, however, considering the questions in relation to something I am passionate about, and I got a much higher result. So yes, that pretty much confirms the notion that you have more grit if you care about something. But at the same time, so much of the book is about the vague idea of people being 'gritty' without properly considering these multifaceted depths of grittiness.I agree with most of what is here, but so much is supposition and assumption. The author seems to talk more about her ideas than actual evidence. 'We did this study, and I don't really know why this is the result, but I would guess it's because ...' So even the research is inconclusive, even if highly suggestive.She also talks a lot about herself? Which honestly came across as more arrogant than helpful.I have a friend who is a brilliant artist. Once, while looking at some of his work, I said, 'Man, I wish I had half your talent!'His response? That by envying his talent, I was minimising all of the hard work he'd put into mastering his craft.For me, that single comment from my friend told me everything this book spent 400-odd pages trying to tell me. I still think about it when I find myself envying the success of others, or wanting my own success.The takeaway: As much as we admire talent, and fantasise about having it ourselves, to truly be successful in something we need to work at it. By seeing the result of someone's hard work as 'talent', we're excusing ourselves from having to put in the same kind of effort. If you want something bad enough, you'll put in the work. If you don't want to put in the work, you don't want it enough.I think this book should have been less about how important grit is, and more about how one can find their own grit. It discusses it vaguely, but it seems purposeless instead of motivational; aimless instead of focused. It's crowded with the success stories of others, but the message never changes: determination to succeed is more important than having a talent for it.It's certainly got some good ideas and will serve as a great awakening for some - this may be the book you need to motivate you to start structuring your life in terms of goals that will lead to your ultimate success. It might encourage you to stop thinking ideally and start thinking practically. It might reveal to you what you ARE passionate about, and what you AREN'T. But it's ultimately a book of ideas, and you're going to have to do a lot of hard work by yourself.Here's how I think of Grit:Say you're reading a book and you find it's not really your cup of tea. It's dull, with lifeless characters, and it's riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. It's mostly a chore to read. By the time you finish it, you're exhausted and regret the hours you wasted on it.Then you pick up a book that has everything you love - brilliant writing, interesting plot, great characters ... you find yourself unable to put it down and when you finish you feel satisfied and happy you chose to read it.Don't berate yourself for not having grit - you do. You just need to find the passion that unlocks it."
13,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2428855-ana-marlatt,5,"For the many critics of Duckworth and her theory of Grit, I say: read this book. You will not find anywhere here that Grit is about ""sucking it up and getting it done"". Angela Duckworth writes: ""This book has been my way of taking you out for a coffee and telling you what I know."" To me, this coffee date pacified off and will be repeated a few times. This book is filled with the science of Grit (Duckworth is a scientist after all), as well as countless stories about Grit. The stories stick. I will have to read the book again to internalize the science of it all. I suggest you start the book with the conclusion. It gives readers a great outline of what the book is about, without giving it all away. In the conclusion you will also find this gem: ""To be gritty is to keep putting one foot in front of the other. To be gritty is to hold fast to an interesting and purposeful goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after week after year, in challenging practice. To be gritty is to fall down seven times, and rise eight."" Inspiring stuff, but definitely easier said than done. If you inspire more grit in your life, this book is a good way to find focus, inspiration and guidance. "
14,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53414564-chadi-raheb,2,"I know! I know! I know! I got that! Talent is not everything! Yeah we got that! Gosh!Why would she repeat each point like million times through millions of pages?!Briefly: Don't just rely on your talent if you consider yourself smart! Because there's somebody out there who is less talented than you, but working his ass off, and while you're busy procrastinating, thinking there's still time, that person would surpass. So make that damn plan & get it done!P.S. These authors have to learn how to write short & specific. Even a 100-page would be too much & a waste of time!

15,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer,4,"""As much as talent counts, effort counts twice.""Professor and MacArthur Award winner Angela Duckworth has entered the ""talent vs. effort"" discussion with years of research showing that dedicated effort -- what she calls ""grit""-- is far more important to success than any innate talent. While some agree (see books such as Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else, and Helping Children Succeed: What Works and Why, among others) critics have both questioned her research or dismissed it as nothing more than the sage old advice that's been around for ages: ""Work hard and never give up.""I found this book to be very engaging and inspiring, not only for my own aspirations but also in thinking about the values and skills I hope to instill in my children. Duckworth explains her research in easy-to-understand terms, and gives plenty of real world anecdotes and examples. While I find myself more in the camp that thinks that this research is likely just the next step of the age-old ""work hard"" advice, for me this book still served as a motivating rallying call to keep pushing on to reach my personal and professional goals. Thank you to NetGalley and Scriber for a galley of this book in exchange for an honest review.

16,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40275186-sarah,2,"I'm quitting. I think I had 4 chapters left. I read this for a work book club. The good: It's easy to read and has some great examples of grit.The bad: The whole concept of the book can be summed up in literally one sentence: ""Success is not dependent on talent, but on the combination of a effort and perseverance, dubbed by Duckworth as Grit."" That idea or some variation is repeated ad nauseam over the course of 277 pages and I just really can't take anymore. This doesn't need a whole book dedicated to it. I'm annoyed.She also never bothers to define success or what it means for the average Joe or Jane. She gives great examples of Jeff Bezos, Presidents and CEOs of huge companies, olympic athletes.I mean- is this the only way we are defining success? What does grit and the resulting success look like for me? Examples that didn't seem so unattainable would have been nice and made the book more relatable. Maybe she gets to that point in a later chapter. I don't know. I don't really care anymore. Some of us don't live to work. We work to live. Duckworth also doesn't really bother to comment on how some degree of luck factors into the whole thing. The Cinnabon girl - great she learned all the jobs at Hooters and went on to become VP. I learned all the jobs there were to learn at a company, trained countless employees, and it never resulted in more than a pat on the back. Sorry. It isn't only about grit.She also uses some examples of academics, studies done on school age children and such. Academics is the wrong way to measure this success. Plenty of people become successful who did terrible in high school or dropped out of college (granted, this is not the norm). Academics is just not a good factor for determining success. Myself, I did great in school, and I did it with what felt like little effort on my part. It just wasn't difficult for me. Grades are also therefore, a terrible indicator of grit in general.This book reaffirmed for me why I don't want to be bothered with non-fiction. Most of what needed to be said I could have read in an article which would have been less time consuming. Bleh. I'm happy to be done with this."
17,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,5,"An excellent read after the Growth Mindset. Some takeaways: - Why effort is important (effort can make a change to the brain structure, as the brain is remarkable adaptive). - Why deliberate practice is a crucial part to experience the ""flow"" condition. - Why we have to learn how to fail and look back to our mistakes and ask: ""what did I learn, how can I make it better the next time, how to make the right kind of effort"".- IQ is not fixed, so are other qualities.- The circle of struggle, followed by progress, followed by trying something even harder.- Talent is common, attitude is more important.- How should you parent for grit. What are the ""wise"" type of parents?- Character is plural. There are intrapersonal character (including grit, self-control...), interpersonal character (gratitude, social intelligence), and intellectual character (curiosity, zest)."

20,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,2,"I am interested generally in the idea of “grit.” It’s hard sometimes to not be discouraged, to have resilience and to get up and keep going after setbacks, and I’m interested in how to develop that trait.To that end, this book skims over some relevant ideas. Apparently everything might come down to your overall worldview, or, as I read it, your humanism and compassion. The author talks about a “fixed mindset” vs. a “growth mindset”: whether you believe that people are born a certain way and have an innate capacity for skills/talents/intelligence, or whether you believe that people can change, based on their effort or opportunities or support. This general belief often translates to how you see challenges in your personal life: whether you pessimistically believe that there are permanent and pervasive reasons for your suffering, or whether you optimistically believe that there are temporary and specific reasons for your suffering. (This is also where mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful.) It’s also important to have people around you to encourage you and support you and believe that you can do it. All of this then adds up to your capacity for perseverance and resilience. tl;dr: It’s important to believe in change and have hope.All of that kind of gels, but was really a small part of the book. Overall, the writing was overly punchy and mostly empty filler, which become tiresome. I was most disappointed that the book focused so much on career. I’m really tired of all these articles and books about pursuing your “passion” in your job. These pieces use people like Warren Buffet or Jeff Bezos as examples, without mentioning that (1) these people are arguably geniuses in their fields who were laser-fixated on their particular interests from childhood, something that is very rare, and (2) most people don’t want to spend every waking minute thinking about their work at the expense of family, or friends, or leisure time, etc. (N.B. I just watched the Warren Buffet documentary on HBO and I’m not sure that he doesn’t regret not developing his personal/familial relationships more throughout the course of his career.) I don’t think it’s important or realistic to instruct people to find a “passion”; I particularly don’t think it’s important or realistic to instruct people to find a “purpose.” And I don’t believe that either is a recipe for happiness. It all seems kind of backwards. If you have the privilege to choose what you do, I think it’s important to find a monetize-able skill that you generally like and want to be better at, and then to choose a workplace with a structure and environment that suits you where you can use that skill. “Passion” is then something that develops only after you begin to excel in your work, once you can add value and feel competent and confident. You can also feel ""passion"" not only in your job, but also in anything else you choose to do, so people don't only have to have one ""passion"" they are pursuing as a career. I have more to say about this but won’t ramble any more on goodreads about it.Anyhow, by focusing so much on career, the book kind of lost its way, and missed a good opportunity to talk deeply about “grit” in general in life, to talk about how this is impacted by socioeconomics/culture/race, to talk about social support or the lack thereof and how we as a society can work to change it, and, ultimately, to really help people move forward from difficult times, even if they don't have the people or environment to help them do so."
21,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4934590-david-yoon,4,"A fascinating exploration of Grit. There’s even a Grit questionnaire to assess how gritty you are. I’m moderately gritty BTW - happily mediocre. I’m aware I could be grittier and resolve to do so, but then I’ve already moved on to the next book. I like the idea though. It seems like a hearty admonishment of work and stick-to-it-ness that appeals to my Asian upbringing - Duckworth herself is raised by Chinese immigrants. It’s resonated far more than the conversing with your creativity ala Elizabeth Gilbert’s Big Magic or Brené Brown’s focus on shame and our own imperfections. And like all the best pop-psych books there’s lots of anecdotes from folks at the top of their game. Truly gritty paragons. And it’s reassuring for those of us lacking natural talents or long past the age to ever be considered a prodigy of anything. That through focused effort and perseverance we can excel. An extension of Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000 hours. Perseverance and passion - perhaps distilled down to this it’s nothing new but nonetheless an engrossing read that got me thinking of where I could be grittier and how to raise grittier kids. "
22,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4943518-denise,4,"“...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.” When it come to grit i'm only slightly above average as reported back to me after taking the test Angela Duckworth provides within the book. Not only was this book a good explanation on the determinants of success, but also a great way to assess how you can up your own grittiness (and the grittiness of those around you) in hopes of increasing your probability for success. The stories inside are fascinating and inspiring, though there are some that reek of disregarded privilege for the sake of a story. As i go through my own day-to-day, and start to read other books (currently: Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery by Scott Kelly), I find myself starting to see the world through a lens of grittiness that I hadn't before. I think this speaks to the power of how pervasive the idea of ""pulling ones self up by the bootstraps"" is across our culture. However, Duckworth makes sure to inform you that you also need to have inspired action behind that efforting. I would love to think of the simple formula of perserverence + passion = success, as being something that is so widely adopted that those are the only things truly necessary for success. However, in my personal experience, having those two things is merely an expected foundation, not a catapult for achievement. In regards to my own experiences, she touches on the possible origin of this principle's failure as stemming from the culture in which you are surrounded by. We often hear of the fixed/growth mindset anecdote thrown around to talk about why people are failing, but we do not address how businesses, schools, families, and other organizations, also develop a culture that promotes one of the two. Put simply, your grittiness level is also affected by your environment, and even if you do things to increase your grittiness, there are situation in which no amount of grit can leverage your favor. I would have loved to know about grittiness long ago to see how my grittiness levels have changed over time, and in different situations. (Then maybe I could know for sure whether it was the environment or my own personal grittiness that posed as an obstacle to my growth, but that's the scientist in me talking) The most important part of this book I think is the fact that she stresses how building grittiness is possible, and oh so readily available. The one downside is that it involves the one thing us fast paced, attention deficit Americans lack the most - sustained, intentional, consistent work. There's a reason why the simplicity in Nike's ""Just Do It"" campaign has stuck around for so long.The one surprising thing to me that she touched on, was that the passion part of her formula may not present itself right away in terms of finding what you're good at. She tells you to follow your heart, and all that mushy stuff, but she also emphasizes that most things are going to feel like a chore at first. Sometimes even for years before we inevitably fall in love with it. Shes not wrong, but I also believe the failures and dead ends give us a route to what we  actually  love. "
23,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61042201-shahzad-suleman,4,Angela Duckworth compels attention with her idea that regular individuals who exercise self-control and perseverance can reach as high as those who are naturally talented — that your mindset is as important as your mind.

This is nonfiction and when I counted how many discs this was for the audio, I thought it was going to feel so, so long...but it didn't. I found this fascinating. I'm not familiar with the author or her work, but I thought this was eloquently written. She covered all her points and didn't get all technical, but considered the regular people who wold probably read this. This is a book that I think I may need to read again, because there was so much info and a lot of it was useful."
25,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,4,"Thomas Edison said that success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. And remember Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule? Angela Duckworth this calls stick-to-it-iveness “grit.” (I’m not too keen on the word, itself.) Her method of reaching more or less the same conclusion involves more science and even a couple of equations: Talent + Effort = Skill AND Skill + Effort = Achievement. Maybe to some, her conclusions don’t seem terribly new. Didn’t we already know this? But Duckworth is a highly regarded researcher and she provides a wealth of evidence (from her own research and that of others) to support her hypotheses. She provides a lot of ways to think about identifying life goals and how to achieve them. And she explores the fact that some of us are able to persevere in the face of adversity, while others with the same talent and same goals, just don’t. The book contains both research findings and interesting anecdotes about successful people. The content is solid and I suspect the audiobook is even better than the read. Duckworth reads it, herself, and I really liked her style and pacing. And, by the way, Duckworth is the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “Genius Grant.” Her research is more complex and nuanced than my summary (or even her book) might suggest and has many implications for teaching and learning. I’m getting to the end of my working years, so I’m probably not part of the target audience for this book. But it nevertheless gave me some ideas for how to apply Duckworth’s findings to other aspects of my life. The book contains a lot of good advice for parents, too."

I found it a snoozer and I felt a little sorry for the author who appears to be obsessed with the topic of achievement. Perhaps I'm too much of a slacker to appreciate the power of "" grit"", but I think my real issue is tethering grit to "" success"", because I'm not sure I agree with the author's definition of success. I had the same problem with Gladwell's Outliers as all his case studies were cherry picked to illustrate examples of ""success"" filtered through his own perception of what that should be. The yogi in me completely disagrees with Grit at all costs and I daily see the physical price paid by those who adhere to inflexible goals. And the Tiger Mom in me conversely says "" so what?"" Of course I want my kids to pursue extracurricular activities and have a work ethic! Not sure I learned anything here I didn't already know. "

This is pretty straight forward: you need grit to be successful. It is a bit more nuanced and Duckworth interviews various people in various professions that have all become successful because they have grit. This is like the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking in that it teaches you a different way of guiding your own life, your kids' lives and, if you teach, your students' lives. I am eager to see if she follows this up. "

31,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
32,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
33,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

41,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
42,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
43,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
44,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It seemed to me the ver first time to come across such terminology. Furthermore, it gave me hope and power to a better future. The talk is tremendous and energetic. Firmly knowing that the talker issued a whole new book about grit seemed to be the compass back to my intended pathway to success. However, the book was nothing like the talk. It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand. Nothing to be like the TedTalk she once conducted.I believe the studies made for this book is much worthy to be adapted through this writing and in such context. Unfortunately, the book was dull and boring to a very high extent I could've never thought of while watching the talk.Watch the Ted talk"

I've discovered, to my surprise, that most of the books are backed-up by studies, which are in themselves fascinating and quite helpful. This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!"" Perhaps the point is you have to just bumble forth without directions and a jolly willingness to get lost. Still, I found this book less helpful than I anticipated, especially given the stratospheric reviews."

49,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
50,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""
51,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I'm always a little suspicious of pop psych books. As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

Yeah this was one of those books for me. So here follows one of my longest reviews, because I had a lot of take away's I want to remember. To get from talent to achievement: talent x effort=skill, skill x effort=achievementSo while talent is helpful, effort is twice as important.Grit is passion AND perserverance.We all have goal hierarchy's. Low level goals are every day goals or weekly goals (such as making it to work on time), these lead to a ""Why?"" which leads to mid level goals and then to top goals. When the why is because. you've reached the top.Write down 25 career goals. Circle the 5 most important or interesting to you. Then look at the 20 not circled and AVOID these. They are distractions.Find your focus. Improvise. Adapt. Become. Define your own Style!You can develop grit. 1. Interest. Discovery is sparked through interaction with the outside world. Parents: Before hard work comes play. Encourage interest by starting with play, make it a game. Do not rush a beginner.Discovery: What do I think about? How do I enjoy spending my time? What matters most to me? What do I find unbearable? Then go out and experiment2. Practice. Resist complacency, always improve. Experts have deliberate practice by making it a habit. 3. Purpose. When your self disciplined practice becomes a focus on others. (Doing it for the greater good, or help someone etc)4. Hope. Keep going past your doubts. ""You never know who will be the next great influencer in the world, so treat everyone like they are that person""Hard thing rule (to grow grit)1. Everyone does a hard thing (kids and parents) requiring daily practice.2. You can quit, but not until the interval is up. (end of season, paid for amount of lessons, or at high school age 1 year)3. The individual picks their hard thingThen she talked about the UNC Women's soccer team and how they have core values and memorize them and it creates a culture of grit. Competition is not about winning or being better then the other people, it's about being the best you personally can be. And I just really loved their core value 1. Let’s begin with this, we don’t whine. This tough individual can handle any situation and never complains about anything on or off the field. (“The true joy in life is to be a force of fortune instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.” George Bernard Shaw).

53,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/532510-jamie,5,"First of all, I wish I had purchased this book rather than borrow it from the library. It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that.

61,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
62,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
63,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this.

71,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
72,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
73,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
74,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand.

Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!""

79,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
80,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""

As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be.""

It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale.

91,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
92,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
93,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

101,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
102,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
103,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
104,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!""

109,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
110,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""

As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

To get from talent to achievement: talent x effort=skill, skill x effort=achievementSo while talent is helpful, effort is twice as important.Grit is passion AND perserverance.We all have goal hierarchy's.

When the why is because. you've reached the top.Write down 25 career goals. Circle the 5 most important or interesting to you. Then look at the 20 not circled and AVOID these. They are distractions.Find your focus. Improvise. Adapt. Become. Define your own Style!You can develop grit. 1. Interest. Discovery is sparked through interaction with the outside world. Parents: Before hard work comes play. Encourage interest by starting with play, make it a game. Do not rush a beginner.Discovery: What do I think about? How do I enjoy spending my time? What matters most to me? What do I find unbearable? Then go out and experiment2. Practice. Resist complacency, always improve. Experts have deliberate practice by making it a habit. 3. Purpose. When your self disciplined practice becomes a focus on others. (Doing it for the greater good, or help someone etc)4. Hope. Keep going past your doubts.

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that.

121,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."

It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
123,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All.

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts.

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

131,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
132,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
133,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
134,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It seemed to me the ver first time to come across such terminology. Furthermore, it gave me hope and power to a better future. The talk is tremendous and energetic. Firmly knowing that the talker issued a whole new book about grit seemed to be the compass back to my intended pathway to success. However, the book was nothing like the talk. It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand. Nothing to be like the TedTalk she once conducted.I believe the studies made for this book is much worthy to be adapted through this writing and in such context.

I've discovered, to my surprise, that most of the books are backed-up by studies, which are in themselves fascinating and quite helpful. This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!"" Perhaps the point is you have to just bumble forth without directions and a jolly willingness to get lost. Still, I found this book less helpful than I anticipated, especially given the stratospheric reviews."

139,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
140,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""
141,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I'm always a little suspicious of pop psych books. As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it.

151,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
152,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
153,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

The same thing was repeated in long dull sentences with excessive use of anecdotes. The entire book could be condensed to less than 100 pages with just the most useful parts (although there were few). The only reason I finished this was to avoid the irony of not finishing a book about grit. I received a free digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Peace. "

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this.

161,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
162,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
163,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
164,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand. Nothing to be like the TedTalk she once conducted.I believe the studies made for this book is much worthy to be adapted through this writing and in such context.

I've discovered, to my surprise, that most of the books are backed-up by studies, which are in themselves fascinating and quite helpful. This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!"" Perhaps the point is you have to just bumble forth without directions and a jolly willingness to get lost.

169,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
170,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""

As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that. All similar to the rabbit and tortoise. If you have ever been to a rock climbing gym or met a tiger mom, you probably don't need to read the rest of the bookThe author won a genius award so she is solid.

181,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
182,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
183,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

191,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
192,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
193,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
194,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!""

199,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
200,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""

As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

Yeah this was one of those books for me. So here follows one of my longest reviews, because I had a lot of take away's I want to remember. To get from talent to achievement: talent x effort=skill, skill x effort=achievementSo while talent is helpful, effort is twice as important.Grit is passion AND perserverance.We all have goal hierarchy's. Low level goals are every day goals or weekly goals (such as making it to work on time), these lead to a ""Why?"" which leads to mid level goals and then to top goals. When the why is because. you've reached the top.Write down 25 career goals. Circle the 5 most important or interesting to you. Then look at the 20 not circled and AVOID these. They are distractions.Find your focus. Improvise. Adapt. Become. Define your own Style!You can develop grit. 1. Interest. Discovery is sparked through interaction with the outside world. Parents: Before hard work comes play. Encourage interest by starting with play, make it a game. Do not rush a beginner.Discovery: What do I think about? How do I enjoy spending my time? What matters most to me? What do I find unbearable? Then go out and experiment2. Practice. Resist complacency, always improve. Experts have deliberate practice by making it a habit. 3. Purpose. When your self disciplined practice becomes a focus on others. (Doing it for the greater good, or help someone etc)4. Hope. Keep going past your doubts. ""You never know who will be the next great influencer in the world, so treat everyone like they are that person""Hard thing rule (to grow grit)1. Everyone does a hard thing (kids and parents) requiring daily practice.2. You can quit, but not until the interval is up. (end of season, paid for amount of lessons, or at high school age 1 year)3. The individual picks their hard thingThen she talked about the UNC Women's soccer team and how they have core values and memorize them and it creates a culture of grit. Competition is not about winning or being better then the other people, it's about being the best you personally can be. And I just really loved their core value 1. Let’s begin with this, we don’t whine. This tough individual can handle any situation and never complains about anything on or off the field. (“The true joy in life is to be a force of fortune instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.” George Bernard Shaw).

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that.

211,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
212,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
213,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts.

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

221,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
222,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
223,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
224,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It seemed to me the ver first time to come across such terminology. Furthermore, it gave me hope and power to a better future. The talk is tremendous and energetic. Firmly knowing that the talker issued a whole new book about grit seemed to be the compass back to my intended pathway to success. However, the book was nothing like the talk. It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand. Nothing to be like the TedTalk she once conducted.I believe the studies made for this book is much worthy to be adapted through this writing and in such context.

This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!""

229,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
230,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""
231,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I'm always a little suspicious of pop psych books. As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be.""

241,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."

The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

The same thing was repeated in long dull sentences with excessive use of anecdotes. The entire book could be condensed to less than 100 pages with just the most useful parts (although there were few). The only reason I finished this was to avoid the irony of not finishing a book about grit. I received a free digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Peace. "

If I had to recco just only one book for the year 2016, this would be one.

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this.

251,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
252,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
253,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"
254,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8460201-karen,3,"""Grit"" research is quite well known in psychology circles and is making it's way into the mainstream vernacular. Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

It is full of scientific details and researches that will flip your mind. Arriving by the end of the book with nothing in hand. Nothing to be like the TedTalk she once conducted.I believe the studies made for this book is much worthy to be adapted through this writing and in such context.

I've discovered, to my surprise, that most of the books are backed-up by studies, which are in themselves fascinating and quite helpful. This book I was less impressed with, because despite the interesting studies and papers it discusses, the ""advice"" portion was all circular reasoning and remarkably unhelpful: ""How do you get grit? Don't give up!"" That's like, ""How do you find your way to the grocery store? Drive there!"" Perhaps the point is you have to just bumble forth without directions and a jolly willingness to get lost.

259,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"About a decade ago, psychologist Carol Dweck made a big splash by positing the difference between the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
260,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""
261,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I'm always a little suspicious of pop psych books. As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."

Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that. All similar to the rabbit and tortoise. If you have ever been to a rock climbing gym or met a tiger mom, you probably don't need to read the rest of the bookThe author won a genius award so she is solid.

271,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,2,"Grit by Angela Duckworth is a book with broad ambitions to cover the topic of grit: what it is, who has it and how to get it. Grit shares a common heritage with many other growth mindset books such as The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonigal. Growth mindset books lie at the vertex of Eastern and Western philosophy; do my actions dictate my fate or are we all just subject to the inertia of the universe? Duckworth asserts the value of grit through its utility to provide a tangible benefit, namely success. The author spends a large portion of the book viewing grit through the eyepiece of success, parading out case study after case study of people who are successful because, they were gritty, I guess. The major problem with this approach is that very quickly you subject yourself to survivorship bias. By only looking at successful people and ex post facto defining them as gritty, does not form a causal link between the two. The elephant in the room is this: given identical genetics, psychological makeup and circumstances, does grit make the difference in achieving success? A second problem I had with this book is the use of Professional Football Coach, Pete Carroll as a paradigm of grit. While unquestionably a fierce competitor, Carroll's collegiate coaching career is littered with a number of major cheating scandals, surely the diametric opposite of grit, that go unmentioned by Duckworth. All this being said, grit, and more generally growth mindset, are important tools, not a panacea, toward reaching achievement in all of the spheres of your life. Grit contains an important message; however, it suffers as a book by masquerading as a result of scientific inquiry."
272,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5011787-huyen,0,"Takeaway message: find your passion and work hard. The title already told everything. It's a good book but the idea is not so new, even though it concerns about a fairly new concept named grit. Nonetheless, it's a good book esp. for those who haven't read a lot of psychology books before, and parents. "
273,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16869375-sasha-nelson,1,"I have so many issues with this book I hardly know where to begin, but I will do my best to summarize my main concerns, and limit myself to 5. The first being, it took a lot of grit for me to get through this. I am glad to hear that much of the research in Duckworth's work is now being questioned. I became interested in Duckworth because she is often quoted on Freakonomics and other podcasts I enjoy, and I frequently found her comments to be insightful. After reading this book, I am fairly convinced that her research is far from innovative and rigorous and proves little of what we don't already intuitively know: working harder can help you get ahead. I have been seething throughout this excruciatingly boring Audiobook, and am just glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it. Here goes:Concern #1: (as mentioned above), almost impossible do get through. Repetitive, hardly distinguishable chapters with very little practical information. Lots of corporate speak fillers for punch lines. Just not very well written.Concern #2: Obsession with famous leaders/programs and all things deemed ""highly successful"" without scrutiny. Duckworth falls pretty squarely into the camp of people who are fascinated by the rich and the famous. From Jamie Dimon to Jeff Bezos, she loves them all and sees them as paragons of grit. Duckworth doesn't seem at all interested in the grit it takes to say, be a single mom and work 3 jobs to put your kids through school. Why study the grit of regular people who do difficult things every day when you can focus on celebrities, and such uncontroversial ones at that? This drove me absolutely nuts, especially since unlike say Malcom Gladwell, who at least acknowledges in Outliers that such high levels of success are usually a result of circumstances and luck, not just bare-knuckle focus, Duckworth sees no other factors to success other than grit.Concern #3: Self-aggrandizing. Duckworth won't miss a chance to remind you that her life goal is more noble than yours: she wants to help kids learn and succeed. This is hard to buy especially given the self-help nature of this book - I don't think there are many tangible things in here for kids short of, ""you should work really really hard"". Moreover, she loves Teach for America and the KIPP schools, praising them unequivocally without acknowledging any of the controversies or criticisms around them. Her top level priority came away feeling as disingenuous. which leads me to a big one...Concern #4: Passion-talk. This is an issue I have spent so much time thinking about that it was almost impossible for me to get through the sections of the book that focused on passion. Duckworth claims that the grit she is talking about/trying to measure is distinguished by ""passion."" *Spoiler alert* ""people who are passionate at what they do enjoy their work more than those who aren't."" This is all amazingly new and innovative, except for the fact this kind of thinking, in my opinion, is incredibly narrow and sets people up for failure. First, not everyone has a ""passion"" and that's ok. Second, not everyone's ""passion"" a career makes. Third, not all people want/need their ""passion"" to be their career. Duckworth's central tenant, seemingly, is that the best outcome is if your job is your passion so you can happily work 24/7, family, responsibilities, and all else be damned. I emphatically disagree. Having your passion be your work, for many is an extreme privilege. Many passions don't lead to careers that end up making you be able to put food on the table or have a life outside of your job. I'd love to be a book critic for the New York Times. Anyone know how often that job opens up? Also, the idea that you should only have one passion and pursue it as your job is narrow and simplistic. I have many passions like reading, travel, etc. I don't even try to them for a job because I simply don't want my livelihood to depend on them. My student loans certainly can't depend on them. Instead, I have a job I like, which allows me to pursue these passions in my free time. Of course, I'm also a horrible person, because my life doesn't have a fancy mission like ""helping all kids."" So there's that. Concern #5: Breaking News: Working Hard Makes You Better at Things. In the end, I'm not really sure what I learned here that's new. Does working hard make you better at things? Sure. Is that what leads to what Duckworth defines as ""success"" (i.e. becoming Jeff Bezos, or something)? Sometimes. Maybe. Often not. As many have said, working hard is part of the equation. There's a reason Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In has quickly fallen from grace. And that was a much more interesting read with some good tips, despite it's problems. If you want to read a book about working hard and succeeding at work, (i.e. the only important place to succeed according to Duckworth), I'd stick with Sandberg. Sometimes working hard works, often times, it can burn you out and get you nowhere. Also, not all jobs are ones that you can just ""work really hard at."" They take new strategies, a sponsor, and of course, luck. I rarely write reviews that are this long, but this is because Duckworth's book infuriated me, with its simplistic, under-baked message. I don't understand how these less-than scientific anecdotes about professional celebrities have struck such a chord that they become movements, but it is clear that Duckworth's' theory doesn't care about real people or real issues. But actually, I do understand. Our culture is obsessed with ""Thought Leaders,"" and anyone whose idea sounds like quick fix gets disproportionate air time. For more on this, I recommend Anand Giriharadas' Winners Take All. In the meantime, here are some articles that highlight the issues with Duckworth's Grit much more eloquently than I did:https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cul... https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/..."

Flow feels amazing. You're powering through problem upon problem for hours. You come out of it and feel like you can do anything. But when you're really learning you don't lose track of time. You hate time.On those days you bang your head against the wall for 6 hours and feel like shit after afterwards. Emotionally, the day of flow feels much better. However, the 6-hours of banging is where you're learning; tearing down the bulwark. The next day you tend to crack it. It matches my experience learning has to be a bit painful. The people who have grit understand this. They seek that. I internalize it as a mandatory activation energy of difficulty that rewards you with plenty of flow afterwards. Sure, you'll learn in flow too, but it's not going to be of the 'leap to the next lily pad'-type.> In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance. Gritty people are people who seek this. They are thirsty for finishing things, whether it's building something, or reaching a deep understanding of something. The book develops this concept well. I'm glad I spent 200 pages or so thinking about this concept, because it's important. The book is easy to read and it's trivial to skim through the repetitive parts. For more stars, I should struggle less to come up with more insightful angles to view this from from memory."

Duh!! It's easier to work 10,000 hours on something if it interests you. Duh!!! All this and more findings from the Department of Incredibly Obvious Results.The non-obvious things seem fishy. For example, Duckworth mentions Enron and somehow blames the collapse there on intelligence/talent. ??? In reality, grit does not matter for career success in a culture of corruption and incompetence. 

 The whole grit thing is just the same old ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" myth of how anyone can be rich and successful in America as long as they work hard and play by the rules. Repeating this in a book is the safe recipe for an author to become a ""thought leader."" 

There is some reasonable-sounding practical advice in this book, but it is mainly common sense stuff that the author doesn't even pretend is based on research. Nerd addendum:As for Duckworth's original research, it seems to be missing the point with irrelevant outcomes and inadequate controls, like the bit on getting through the initial weeks at West Point. Maybe that process selects for stubborn rule followers as opposed to great leadership. What happens to the people who abandon West Point? Are they all hopeless bums or are they successful at something else? The discussion of Flow is simplistic to the point of inaccuracy. Time is part of the concept. As you get more skilled at something, it gets easier. Then you can increase the difficulty and stay in Flow. In fact, you need to increase the difficulty to remain in Flow. So presenting Flow as something that contradicts grit seems misleading. I think that Flow actually encompasses grit but that would just mean there is nothing new here in this book... What can you have the grit to spend 10000 hours on? The activities that align with your passion, interest, talent, gifts, capacity, etc. Flow already covers this. If you are five feet tall no amount of grit will make you the next Michael Jordan.

281,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,2,"A book full of interesting insights that ultimately failed to please me. It’s too long to start with. I feel an 100-page summary that steers clear of the chatter would have been more effective in communicating the main ideas. About halfway through I started to rely on pen and paper to keep track of the argument and sketch out how the core concepts connected. The overall narrative seems to go like this: Passion and Perseverance are the two key components of Grit. Grit leads to Achievement, and onwards to Llfe Satisfaction. Numerous secondary arguments branch off from that main story, trailing an inflated array of concepts in their wake. For instance, are ‘interest', ‘direction', ‘purpose' and ‘passion’ the same thing? What is the conceptual status of the ‘psychological assets’ (Interest, Capacity to Practice, Purpose, and Hope) as opposed to the two core concepts of Passion and Perseverance? These kinds of questions continue to spook around resulting in a disorienting and tiresome reading experience.Another issue I have been pondering is the following: how to operationalise and measure grit when there is no absolute reference as regards the ‘higher level goals’ that orient and channel these personal efforts? When I apply the Grit Scale to my personal case, I am puzzled because I am not totally sure what my aspirational horizon should be. If ‘consolidate my expert status by writing a book’ is the reference goal, then I’m failing the test. But if the goal is to ‘find an occupy a professional niche that keeps me intellectually challenged’ then I can consider myself to be a paragon of grit. The thing is that I’m unsure about my personal hierarchy of goals and I suspect that I won’t be the only person in that situation. If that is the case, then I wonder what the value of this psychological test is. Finally, I feel the author is not critical enough as regards the potentially destructive effects of grit. At the end of the book she wonders whether people can be too gritty. Duckworth seems so convinced of the benign character of grit that she hasn’t given this question much thought. Her answer is uncharacteristically short and it is also muddled. It’s not only about there being too many gritty people on aggregate, or about people judging themselves as being too gritty. But also whether people are being judged too gritty by their peers and intimates. Duckworth concedes that grit does not guarantee positive social functioning. But she doesn’t ponder the destructive effects of grit, by itself or in combination with other character traits such as greed and hubris. Newspapers and world literature is full of exemplars of gritty people wreaking havoc in their mindless pursuit of their noble or their petty goals. 2,5 stars."
282,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,1,"107th book for 2018.According to Duckworth, success has little to do with innate talent but is a combination of perseverance and passion, what she calls Grit.Duckworth presents Grit as her great original contribution to psychology. However, none of her insights (at least those that stand up to experimental validation) are original. K. Anders Ericsson has made a career out of showing that expertise (essentially Duckworth's success) is largely a question of hours of deliberate practice not innate ability. His initial, and most famous study, involving students at an elite music academy in Berlin showed that the difference between those judged to be future soloists and those destined to the lowly ranks of teachers (!) was only a question of hours of practice. Future soloists entered the school with about 10000 hours of practice in childhood, whereas future teachers with considerably less (Note: 100000 hours did not make these students experts - that was only where they were when they joined the academy). Ericcson's claim at the time, that inate talent played NO factor in future success, was truly shocking. He went on to study lots of different fields of expertise (chess, sports etc) showing the same result. Other researchers have now had a chance to study the psychological construct ""Grit"" and have found that: (1) Only one of the two sides of the construct, perseverance, but not the other passion predicts future performance, so the construct's validity is likely flawed; and (2) the ""perseverance"" side of Grit itself maps almost entirely onto the very well known psychological trait Conscientiousness, one of the Big Five personality traits, which has been studied for decades. This 2nd point is important, as there is a fair amount of evidence that psychological traits are inate, and not easily modified. For instance, another of the big five personality traits, Introversion/Extroversion, is quite resistant to modification. So despite Duckworth's claim's that sending your child to ballet class (etc) can build grit, there is very little evidence that this is indeed the case (that's not to say that enrichment activities can't to positive, just not necessarily positive in the way Duckworth wants you to think).So to sum up, Grit is at best a confused mish-mash of earlier psychological concepts, her claims about how it can be trained up are likely false, and to top it off the book is poorly written and and reads like a long humble-brag about how great Duckworth is. 1-star.Big Five Personality Traits"
283,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"The main takeaway that I had from reading this book is that talent+effort=skill. Then skill+effort=achievement. To be successful you need twice amount of effort as that of talent. So, talent is not everything. Grit=Passion+Perseverance counts more than talent per se.When I answered the Grit Scale on p. 55, I also found out that I am 95% grittier than a large sample of American adults. This is based on my current frame of mind and it was mostly influenced by my outrageous efforts put in Toastmasters and my busy days supporting the business transformation (translation: working extended hours after each application go live) at work. Not a few of my friends have asked how am I able to do both. To my Goodreads friends: now you know why I was only able to read 7 books for my 2018 Reading Challenge.This book first came to my radar during the last year's Engineering Day in our company. The author's TED talk on the same subject, Grit, was shown pushed by our training senior manager. Then the book got recommended for our company book club. I am grateful for that chain of events because this is an eye-opener kind of book especially if you are a parent to little kids. Teaching your children how to develop grit seems to be a good idea if you believe all the anecdotes that the author recounted in the book.My only minor complaint is that the book focuses more on how to develop grit in children or young adults. For a 50ish father with a grown up daughter, the book has limited applications. Can middle-age adults still develop grit? Is the book saying that grit can only be predicted or discerned while doing ""extra-curricular"" activities? How can adults in a work environment apply grit? None of these questions were directly answered or tackled in the book.Overall, the book is an easy interesting read. I recommend this to everyone who are not born talented but still would like to succeed. After all, everything needs effort and that could be elusive to some people especially those who are born with silver spoon. #VertivBookClub#SecondBook"

Here, Angela Duckworth tries to take readers through her research in a more accessible way (than needing to read all those scientific papers).I do understand why some of the reviews are lukewarm... She is trying to prove to the reader the value of Grit by incorporating research into other areas such as conformity, optimism, mindset etc. and I think if you haven't studied psychology then what she has attempted to put together may come across as a bit of a mish-mash.Personally, I would have preferred much more practical information about how to use your Grit scores ; and differences across settings. So perhaps spending 100-ish pages on the background and research of Grit and then chapter by chapter in sections related to recruitment, leadership, schooling, parenting etc. Then the reader could flip to the area of interest for them and get some steps to take to develop grit in themselves or others.So unless you are already aware of the research and want to know a bit more about how it relates to other psychological studies (by Seligman and Dweck for example), I think for most people there would be more value in listening to her TED talks and exploring her website than picking up this book."

The fixed mindset is the belief that talent and intelligence are inherent traits that can get built upon but don’t really change much. People succeed because they have some innate talent. Our school system, if not our whole society, was based on that. Some kids were “gifted,” and some kids were merely “average,” and the labels were bad for everybody.The growth mindset views that talent and intelligence are common, but what really makes the difference in achievement is hard work. A kid who tests low on an IQ test may sail ahead the next year if he spends enough time reading. The score is anything but fixed.Musical talent illustrates the principle a bit better. Most people you’ll meet have an ear for music and can carry a tune. That means that if they’d put their minds to it, they could learn to read music and play an instrument. But how many people actually do that? And of those, how many really put in the hours of practice that it takes to become professional? It’s not innate ability that makes the difference. It’s work, plain and simple. Or, as this author phrases it, grit.Grit is the ability to stick with something, even when it gets hard or boring. Under the fixed mindset, “gifted” kids are more likely to give up when they hit the first obstacle. “I guess I’m not so talented, after all,” they think. “Otherwise, this would come naturally.” That’s why it’s better to praise hard work and effort than talent. If kids know to expect difficulty, they develop grit, and that leads to achievement.I don’t think anyone can disagree with that, and certainly it has its inspiring side. But even grit isn’t always enough. If one kid comes from a wealthier family than another, he has more resources and free time to devote to, for example, a sports team. The poorer kid misses out on the chance to show his grit, except perhaps in something less rewarding, like an after-school job. And if he consistently gets the signal that the obstacles are greater than his grit, he’ll very logically give up.Duckworth does address this, using the specific example of “learned helplessness” as shown in a famous experiment with dogs. If dogs are shocked at random times for random periods, they’ll cower in the corner and just wait for the torture to be over. But if the shock comes with some way for the dogs to control its duration, they’ll learn to use it and ride out the shocks for as long as they have to. In other words, both dogs and people can get the grit kicked out of them. Your power over your situation is the key.And that is why this book simultaneously made me feel good and bad about myself. On one hand, it inspired me to start writing again. That’s my personal goal, so I might as well show some grit and do it. But on the other, in many areas of my life, I feel like my grit ship sailed long ago. Grit may be a growable trait like any other, but not every limitation can be overcome. Not every failure is due to lack of grit. Some of it is due to a rigged system.So ultimately, I prefer Carol Dweck’s book to Angela Duckworth’s. At every turn, Dweck reminds readers that the fixed mindset is embedded deep within society and within us, even if we’re starting to emerge from it. In other words, if I’m the dog in the experiment, she’s given me a clearer picture of the lever I have to push to end my pain. And above all, she makes a point that I feel Angela Duckworth fails to. It’s not about the reward. It’s about the process. Learn to love that in and of itself. Grit can get you through personal goals, but most external rewards are in someone else’s control."
290,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,4,"This book brings up a very important question that I used to ponder about: What matters to success more? Effort or talent?I have never been the smartest or the most talented person in any room, and knowing that, I used to tell myself to work harder so I could be in the same room as these talented individuals. Although this helped me reach a certain point in my life, I felt that there was still something missing from the equation. After reading this book, it becomes clear that grit is the most important factor to success and that perseverance was only a part of the grit equation.In simple terms, success could be defined by the combination of talent and grit, and the book reasons that grit weighs more to success. Summarizing these points, the success equation may look something like this: Success = talent + A*gritwhere A is a pre-factor much greater than 1.The grit itself then consists of perseverance and passion although the book does not state which one weighs more: Grit = B*perseverance + C*passionPlugging this grit equation to success, the final success equation then becomes: Success = talent + D*perseverance +E* passion Now I understand that the missing parts of my equation were both talent and passion, and thinking that I had no talent, I only increased the perseverance part without considering the other variable, passion. This might be common for many people, although what they are missing from the equation may vary. There are passionate people without perseverance, and talented individuals with wasted potentials. If you're one of these people, the first step is to know what you're missing and then fill in the gaps. This book will be very helpful for such endeavors. Some summaries on how grit is achieved:	- Passion is achieved by developing your interest through deliberate practice and having a sense of purpose	- Perseverance is achieved by adopting a growth mindset and optimistic self-talk	- If parenting for grit, be a supportive but demanding parent (could also work for teachers, mentors, and advisors)And finally, here's my favorite quote from the book:""The challenge of writingIs to see your horribleness on page.To see your terriblenessAnd then to go to bed.And wake up the next day,And take that horribleness and that terribleness,And refine it,And make it not so terrible and not so horrible.And then go to bed again.And come the next day,And refine it a little bit more,And make it not so bad.And then to go to bed the next day.And do it again,And make it maybe average.And then one more time,If you’re lucky,Maybe you get to good.And if you've done that,That's a success."""

As a social science student, I think the hype around the idea that come out books like this can overwhelm the rigors of normal replication and peer review methods. In this book, it does seem like the author is aware of current limitation in the theory as it is now and is very willing to work with other researchers in her field, which I really appreciate.I also, in this case, don't really care if everything about the girt theory ends up being completely correct. I know that in order to learn, I must fail. To me, this is the most important part of grit. It's not about whether you have it, or how you can get more. This is the most crucial element to me because it is so contrary to how we've structured our society. I'm a college student right now and I'm in the honors college. I want to go to grad school some day. This means if I need to keep my GPA up if I want to graduate with high honors and get into a good grad school. There is not a lot of places I feel like I can fail in college. I need to be great right away to get the best grade I can. It is pretty well observed that I'm not the only student that feels that way. It is well document that the need to get a high GPA prevents students from taking risks and causes students to avoid harder or more challenging classes. I have tried to skirt around this by taking a different PE class every semester. I can fail in these classes. I can be bad at the sport at first and then see myself improve. As long as I show up and do the work, I will get an A. I don't know if this is necessarily the best way to conduct our other classes but I do know that the grading system in my PE class makes it much more likely that I will challenge myself and try something new. I like the idea of grit because it encourages this failing to learn behavior. Maybe all the science isn't in yet, but I'll be interested me see how this theory will continue to develop. I hope that maybe someday the world will change to fit this model more and allow us more opportunities to fail without getting punished for taking that risk. "

Yeah this was one of those books for me. So here follows one of my longest reviews, because I had a lot of take away's I want to remember. To get from talent to achievement: talent x effort=skill, skill x effort=achievementSo while talent is helpful, effort is twice as important.Grit is passion AND perserverance.We all have goal hierarchy's. Low level goals are every day goals or weekly goals (such as making it to work on time), these lead to a ""Why?"" which leads to mid level goals and then to top goals. When the why is because. you've reached the top.Write down 25 career goals. Circle the 5 most important or interesting to you. Then look at the 20 not circled and AVOID these. They are distractions.Find your focus. Improvise. Adapt. Become. Define your own Style!You can develop grit. 1. Interest. Discovery is sparked through interaction with the outside world. Parents: Before hard work comes play. Encourage interest by starting with play, make it a game. Do not rush a beginner.Discovery: What do I think about? How do I enjoy spending my time? What matters most to me? What do I find unbearable? Then go out and experiment2. Practice. Resist complacency, always improve. Experts have deliberate practice by making it a habit. 3. Purpose. When your self disciplined practice becomes a focus on others. (Doing it for the greater good, or help someone etc)4. Hope. Keep going past your doubts. ""You never know who will be the next great influencer in the world, so treat everyone like they are that person""Hard thing rule (to grow grit)1. Everyone does a hard thing (kids and parents) requiring daily practice.2. You can quit, but not until the interval is up. (end of season, paid for amount of lessons, or at high school age 1 year)3. The individual picks their hard thingThen she talked about the UNC Women's soccer team and how they have core values and memorize them and it creates a culture of grit. Competition is not about winning or being better then the other people, it's about being the best you personally can be. And I just really loved their core value 1. Let’s begin with this, we don’t whine. This tough individual can handle any situation and never complains about anything on or off the field. (“The true joy in life is to be a force of fortune instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.” George Bernard Shaw).

It is covered in post-it notes from great quotes, insights, etc.Secondly, everyone should read this book, especially teachers and parents. The author quit her high-paying job as a consultant to become a school teacher. Why were the kids with the highest IQ not getting the best grades, while the average IQ rated students were getting the 4.0? Does all success come from pure talent alone, or does talent sometimes hinder us from having to work toward something with passion and perseverance? Enter GRIT!This book has changed how I parent, how I mentor people at work, and how I look at myself. Some people are born gritty, and some can work to have it. Mentioned in this book is the 10,000 hour rule. (It takes 10,000 hours of doing something in order to become an expert at it.)I read this book as part of a book club and we decided that GRIT can be applied to every facet of our lives. Favorite quotes:“as much as talent counts, effort counts twice.”“...grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. The maturation story is that we develop the capacity for long-term passion and perseverance as we get older.” “...there are no shortcuts to excellence. Developing real expertise, figuring out really hard problems, it all takes time―longer than most people imagine....you've got to apply those skills and produce goods or services that are valuable to people....Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you're willing to stay loyal to it...it's doing what you love, but not just falling in love―staying in love.”“The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy.”"

Recently got into it as part of a series of ""passion-work-calling"" books and was not disappointed. Like others in her genre (think Cal Newport/Daniel Pink) she's got a lot of research and science to share. Unlike those two authors, she's weaving the narrative of her own parenting within this story of what grit is and why it matters.Grit = Passion + PerseveranceThis book is an excellent complement to So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport, as it continues to beat the drum that you will not ""know"" your passion instinctively, and that you may have to pursue several simultaneous roads until a winner emerges.Here is another set of equations that really resonated with me, and first appears on p. 42talent X effort = skillskill X effort = achievementSo effort builds skill, but it also makes skills productive.Just as Cal Newport discusses, the maintenance of passion is far more important than the discovery of it:""Fireworks erupt in a blaze of glory and then quickly fizzle, leaving just wisps of smoke and a memory of what was once spectacular. What Jeff's journey suggests instead is passion as a compass - that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and then that guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be."" (p. 60)On p. 169 she shares a gem of an old Japanese saying, ""Fall seven, rise eight.""The book covers a lot of ground, and deals with the way we work using case studies, research, and intelligent writing. She has something to say to mentors/parents as well as those still finding their way. And her message is ultimately hopeful: grit isn't gifted, it's earned, so it's available to everyone."
295,1443442313,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56007-siah,2,"Update: finally finished it. Not because the book was interesting enough to earn that but because I just wanted to show grit in reading this rather disorganized book. This is a bad book. I constantly wondered how a decorated academic could write such an incoherent piece. I hate to say it but my mind was constantly wondering whether I am reading a book whose sole purpose was to prove to the author that her father was wrong. It is as if the author wants to tell you, in million different ways, that her dad’s emotional abuse of her was unwarranted, which it truly was. There is a ton of self congratulations in this book. She goes on and on about her qualifications as a consultant for a mediocre consulting company. Then she makes sure to remind you, in every other page, that she scores high on the grit scale. It is a book for the self-help kumbaya crown. If you have an ounce of critical thinking in you, you probably don’t need this Summary of final chapters: work hard, stay positive, keep at it, give up when you have to, I am gritty, dad was wrong. Old review:It is a good book however it just re-iterates the same ideas over and over again. I am almost done with it but I had to return it to the library before I could finish it. Nevertheless I intend to finish the rest of the book. Summary: those who work hard will finish better that those who are talented. There are thousands of stories in the book to support that. All similar to the rabbit and tortoise. If you have ever been to a rock climbing gym or met a tiger mom, you probably don't need to read the rest of the bookThe author won a genius award so she is solid. The book is not very scientific though"

I wouldn't say the book is bad, and there was certainly a lot of work done in the research (by many of the author's colleagues who she briefly thanks in the beginning before stating that the book is told from first person perspective) but I haven't really learned anything new.If you'd like to read the success stories, the book is plentiful. If you'd like to know about gritty people who weren't successful, there are none. If you just want to get the key ideas (there really aren't too many), watch her TED talk."
