0,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62787798-bill-gates,4,"Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. Once or twice, I stayed up two nights in a row. I knew I wasn’t as sharp when I was operating mostly on caffeine and adrenaline, but I was obsessed with my work, and I felt that sleeping a lot was lazy.Now that I’ve read Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep, I realize that my all-nighters, combined with almost never getting eight hours of sleep, took a big toll. The book was recommended to me by my daughter Jenn and John Doerr. Walker, the director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Human Sleep Science, explains how neglecting sleep undercuts your creativity, problem solving, decision-making, learning, memory, heart health, brain health, mental health, emotional well-being, immune system, and even your life span. “The decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact,” Walker writes.I don’t necessarily buy into all of Walker’s reporting, such as the strong link he claims between not getting enough sleep and developing Alzheimer’s. In an effort to wake us all up to the harm of sleeping too little, he sometimes reports as fact what science has not yet clearly demonstrated. But even if you apply a mild discount factor, Why We Sleep is an important and fascinating book.Because this is a short review, I’ll answer a few questions that I suspect are top of mind for you.Does everyone really need seven or eight hours of sleep a night? The answer is that you almost certainly do, even if you’ve convinced yourself otherwise. In the words of Dr. Thomas Roth, of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, “The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without impairment, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.”Why do we sleep? After all, when you’re sleeping—and all animals do—you can’t hunt, gather, eat, reproduce, or defend yourself. Yet Walker concludes that the evolutionary upsides of sleep are far greater than these downsides. In brief, sleep produces complex neurochemical baths that improve our brains in various ways. And it “restocks the armory of our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manner of sickness.” In other words, sleep greatly enhances our evolutionary fitness—just in ways we can’t see.What can I do to improve my sleep hygiene?- Replace any LEDs bulbs in your bedroom, because they emit the most sleep-corroding blue light.- If you’re fortunate enough to be able to control the temperature where you live, set your bedroom to drop to 65 degrees at the time you intend to go to sleep. “To successfully initiate sleep … your core temperature needs to decrease by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit,” according to Walker.- Limit alcohol, because alcohol is not a sleep aid, contrary to popular belief. While it might help induce sleep, “alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM [rapid-eye-movement] sleep,” Walker says.- If you can possibly take a short midday nap like our ancestors used to and some Mediterranean and South American cultures still do, you should (but no later than 3 pm). It will likely improve your creativity and coronary health as well as extend your lifetime.It took me a little longer than usual to finish Why We Sleep—ironically, because I kept following Walker’s advice to put down the book I was reading a bit earlier than I was used to, so I could get a better night’s sleep. But Walker taught me a lot about this basic activity that every person on Earth needs. I suspect his book will do the same for you."
1,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"This book is genuinely terrifying. The author, a sleep scientist, lists the devastating consequences of getting less than 7-9 hours regularly and it is so much worse than you might have thought. SO much worse. We're basically all going to die. I'm not even kidding--being just an hour short on sleep a day will do serious damage to your immune system almost immediately, and the Western world is in the grip of a massive sleep deprivation epidemic. Lack of sleep is a carcinogen, literally. It also destroys your ability to control your emotions and understand those of others, your memory, your creativity; it predisposes you to eat more *and* to put on more weight; oh, and it is closely linked to ADHD for the young and Alzheimers for the old. Basically, if you go on Twitter and think ""why is everyone and everything so absolutely awful"" it's probably related to society-wide chronic sleep deprivation that people don't even realise they have. This book is genuinely horrifying (ironically, it will keep you up all night fretting). Some of the more striking findings are the absolute madness of night shifts and junior doctor rotas, the self destructive cruelty of school starts that require kids to be awake at 6, and the hecatombs of deaths caused by tired drivers. We've once again managed to set up a social structure apparently designed to cause as much mental and emotional harm as possible to humans. Well done us. I would really like to dismiss all this as alarmist nonsense but the weight of research and the author's qualifications for writing this makes that quite hard, so instead I might just go to bed early forever. Really very scary and depressing to read, but seriously important. (Also highly readable and clearly written, unlike many books by experts for laypeople.)"
2,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"For once, I actually mean five stars in the sense of ""everybody should read this book."" This book is highly readable but contains stunning information I'd never seen anywhere else (and includes numerous references to serious primary literature).I was reminded (stay with me here) of ancient Egyptian funerary practices. After carefully embalming organs like the heart and liver, and placing them in canopic jars, the Egyptians pulled the brain out with a hook and threw it away, because they didn't really know what it was for. This is how most modern people approach sleep. We know it must be sort of important, because why else would it be there, but we're quite foggy on the specifics and tend to give it short shrift. At worst, we see it as an ""annoying and enfeebling"" obstacle to other uses of our time. Some standout topics here: your natural day/night pattern and the buildup of a chemical called adenosine in your brain that makes you sleepy, which contribute independently to your sleep cycle; and how caffeine and jetlag get you off your rhythm. (This was particularly interesting to me because I read this on a long flight. I never sleep on flights to Europe and this book explains why: I'm not sleep deprived enough to have excess adenosine to make me sleepy, plus it doesn't feel like nighttime yet when we depart. So my brain isn't interested in sleeping. When I arrive, my goal is to stay awake until 9pm and at first, it's easy. That's the ""day"" part of the circadian rhythm giving me a bit of a boost. But soon, that fades away and the extra adenosine comes crashing down.) The role of sleep in processing memories and new information: sorting out what's important, solidifying newly gained understanding, and turning traumatic experiences into bearable memories. How all creatures sleep, but in different ways that make the brain-repairing effects of sleep compatible with their environments. Some things that we think aid sleep, like alcohol and sleeping pills, are only useful if your goal is to lie inert in bed; they don't lead to true, restorative sleep. Oh, and the doctor who developed the system for medical residents, and insisted that long shifts and little sleep were essential training, was a big-time cocaine addict.There's some genuinely frightening information here as well. Sleep deficits cannot be made up (sleeping in on the weekends doesn't help) and lead to shorter lifespans. Lack of sleep contributes to Alzheimer's disease, mental illness, and cancer. (The WHO categorizes night shift work as a probable carcinogen.) Drowsy driving is more common than drunk driving and more dangerous. We may be seriously harming the country's teens by forcing them to wake up and go to high school at an hour so inimical to the circadian rhythm of that age group. I already follow the author's advice about ""sleep hygiene"" so I was mostly attuned to the scientific information and arguments here about social ills. Many people in my sleep-deprived cohort may be genuinely alarmed to read this book. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't! I read so many nonfiction books with titles like this one that are ho-hum--but this one's a humdinger.Review copy received from Edelweiss."
3,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"The best book about the importance of sleep and the dangers of a lack of it.Often it´s our own fault, because we eat too much too late, consume media before going to bed, don´t exercise, float the mind with negative and repetitive thoughts that come back at night, sadly not as succubi and incubi, but more the nightmarish evil, not sexy, demon style thing. Even if full 8 hours are reached, the quality can be so low that healthier people with an optimistic mindset find more regeneration with lesser sleep than that. The consequences of sleeping too less because of work, too many hobbies or mental problems are as devastating as overweight, smoking, drinking, and many other harmful activities one normally avoids, but doesn´t care when it´s about finishing just one more level, one more chapter, one more project for work, one more beer with friends, one more episode, one more cancer, heart attack, virus infection due to a weakened immune system... The funny thing is, we mostly don´t to it because of existential necessity, but to consume any kind of medium, have a longer good time with friends and family and intuitively think that the time is better invested in those activities than in 1 or 2 more hours of unproductive, forever lost hours of sleep. Cutting down to under 7, 6, sometimes even less seems legit to get more out of life and we don´t realize that we don´t just pay the expensive long-term price of higher mortality and more sickness, but that the following day is not as productive as creativity, workflow, concentration, and perseverance drastically drop and so we are slower, worse in any aspect, and unmotivated. Even if one sleeps the full 8 hours, the consequences of once sleeping too less or even not can reduce the performance for days, just as alcohol does the days after the hangover. Look how sad you make that poor little brain buddy there behind your eyes, what were you thinking when you did that, that reading is more important or what?But, of course, it´s also societies fault and by forcing kids and teens to wake up far too early to go to school and pressing the last out of every working person, the current conventions produce immense unnecessary harm that could easily be avoided by better, progressive models of society and, once again, shining Scandinavia enters the limelight with the mantra ""Social benefits and social security in a fair and strong eco-social welfare state make happy people.""Any drug around and before sleeping *cough beer cough* is a bad idea, alcohol before sleeping helps to fall asleep, but kills REM- sleep and sleeping pills are strong drugs with severe side effects like for instance killing oneself when accidentally overdosing. If there is already trouble with insomnia, one adds more problems to it by using chemical methods instead of finding out what the real cause is, changing something and searching help. In extreme cases, good old pharma is the only option, but many may not even try alternatives.A big, but unsolvable, problem is the positive effect of sleep deprivation on people with depression and similar mental diseases. I don´t know how the harm of both illnesses could be quantified and compared, but both options seem to be horrible. To be desperately unhappy with full sleep and floating the body with stress hormones while diving ever deeper into the vicious cycle or too sleep far too less and be happier and more motivated, but meanwhile damaging the whole body.This lucid dreaming thing is so extremely individual that one person might be close to unable to ever produce something satisfying while the other can do it as if it was nothing. That´s just random luck or bad luck, some people can add years and more quality to their lives by being conscious and creating any, totally real dream and fantasy wonderland and understanding personal problems, traumas and even solving them, while others can´t crack the brains code how to unlock the treasure chest.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"
4,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Something to ponder; every living thing on earth is subject to the circadian (24 hour) rhythm. It is understandable why animals and plants need to be awake in daylight hours. Less so for fish that for thousands of generations have lived in underground rivers and have over the millenia lost the ability to even sense light. Even less so for bacteria. But still, all of us have this endogenous clock keeping time within us, keeping time with the sun.In the 1930s, a scientist, Nathaniel Kleitman and a colleague attempted to change their body clocks. They spent a month in a cave, 140 feet underground with no natural light and a constant temperature of 54 °F. They used lanterns to regulate their ""daylight"". Each day they slept for 9 hours, worked for 10 and rested for another 9. They measured the rhythm of their body temperatures but could not adjust either that or themselves to the 28-hour cycle, it stubbornly remained at 24 hours no matter what. One of the most intractible sleep disorders is that where the person's body clock does not conform to the universal circadian rhythm. The example given in the book is of a boy whose cycle shifts by an hour a day. For a few days a month he sleeps and is awake and working efficiently at the same time as his schoolmates. But nothing the doctor, the author could do, or any medication, could stop his natural wanting to sleep and wanting to wake to a 24 hour rhythm. The disorder made education very difficult, but as a man, he can work for himself and choose his own hours."

If you don't get enough sleep every day or don't get regular sleep, this is the most important thing you should work on. Lots of bad decisions are made due to lack of sleep so no excuse just make sure you sleep well.As important as sleeping is, writing a whole book about it feels like it's too much.

6,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906165-jv-semi-hiatus,4,"Have you ever felt knackered that you needed to catch some z's hopefully to sleep back what you've previously lost? Have you not slept a wink even if you hit the hay awhile ago and just decided to take some sleeping and other sedating drugs just to make you sleep like a log, but then you would wake up feeling like a zombie of sorts? Well, have no fear, the doctor's here! Not me, okay? Mind you!
""Ultimately, asking 'Why do we sleep?' was the wrong question. It implied there was a single function, one holy grail of a reason that we slept, and we went in search of it.""
For aeons, Mother Nature has been implementing this physiological need we all know as ""sleep"" — a ""powerful elixir of wellness and vitality"" that most of us take for granted (guilty me included)! Before we dive deep into this essential repose, know that this book is neither a self-help one nor it is a guide that will teach you how to have that restful sleep you're looking for, albeit there are 12 tips in the Appendix. Based on sleep science, Dr. Matthew Walker, a former psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and now a neuroscience and psychology professor at UC Berkeley, examines sleep with in-depth analysis backed by years of scientific research letting us know that sleep and dreams are vital for our physical and mental wellness. How so? He tells us that,
""Sleep enriches a diversity of functions, including our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions and choices. Benevolently servicing our psychological health, sleep recalibrates our emotional brain circuits, allowing us to navigate next-day social and psychological challenges with cool-headed composure.""
Dandy eh? For the average adult, 16 hours of wakefulness and 8 hours of sleep is the optimum balance. Caffeine and alcohol are also considered as two of the most common culprits from getting your much-needed slumber, not without evidence. Regarding insufficient sleep or not getting the same quality/quantity of it, you might want to hide under the sheets now as the next one will be a terrible and panic-inducing rollercoaster ride! Well, hang on to your pants and knickers, ladies and gents!
Sleep loss inflicts such devastating effects on the brain, linking it to numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, suicide, stroke, and chronic pain), and on every physiological system of the body, further contributing to countless disorders and disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, infertility, weight gain, obesity, and immune deficiency).
If that doesn't horrify you, I don't know what will! For those who are on a graveyard shift, you have been officially warned.
""A number of prominent epidemiological studies have reported that nighttime shift work, and the disruption to circadian rhythms and sleep that it causes, up your odds of developing numerous different forms of cancer considerably.""
How... umm... reassuring, Dr. Walker! Nevertheless, thank you for that fact. Furthermore, have you ever heard about Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI)? Good grief! I would never ever touch that one within a ten-foot bargepole, but just so, you all must know that ""a lack of sleep will kill a human being."" There are also a lot of scientific terms here that might be familiar to you such as REM or NREM sleep, suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian rhythm, melatonin, etc. None of which I will discuss in full detail lest my puny brain would unnaturally go supernova! Dreams are discussed here too, but I won't be delving on it. By the way, if you also want to magnetise someone with your looks, sense of humour, and personality, along with increasing your chances of landing your first sloppy snog or ultimately going for a home run (a titillating yee-haw!), well mates, heed the sleep scientist's advice: have some shut-eye!
""Reproductive hormones, reproductive organs, and the very nature of physical attractiveness that has a say in reproductive opportunities: all are degraded by short sleeping. One can only imagine Narcissus being a solid eight-to nine-hour sleeper on the basis of the latter association, perhaps with an afternoon nap for good measure, taken beside the reflection pool.""
And there you go, dear folks! Sleep you must and sleep you will! Because I command thee! So, fare thee well! For now, I send thee up to the wooden hill to Bedfordshire! Get it? Good!

7,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,5,"Matthew Walker really, really thinks we all need some serious shut-eye, and he's not messing around when it comes to getting you on board – he hits you with both barrels on page one, and never lets up:Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, more than doubling your risk of cancer. Insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer's disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. Short sleeping increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, setting you on a path to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure […] sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality.And this is supposed to help me sleep better!? At least before, I just used to lie there going over the same three lines from ‘I Just Can't Wait to be King’; now, if I so much as drift into momentary consciousness at two a.m., I end up paralysed with alertness, calculating the gradually rising odds that my obese, cancer-ridden body will only cease to be a concern thanks to the merciful onset of my crippling dementia.Eventually Walker just comes right out and admits that as far as the science is concerned, ‘wakefulness is low-level brain damage’, at which point you start to wonder how far he's really going to take this whole unconsciousness thing. But by then the damage is done. Your life is different. Come evening, when Hannah is pouring herself a glass of Sancerre and playing Gaga, I now appear in the doorway in my slippers, with a hot-water bottle clutched under one arm and a toothbrush jutting from my jaws. It may feel antisocial, but anything seems preferable to inviting the heart disease, obesity, cystitis, tennis elbow and plagues of locusts that Walker is otherwise promising.A while back I got a Fitbit, which allows me to see in appalling detail just how much sleep I sometimes fail to get – the hypnograms, with their discrete stages of slumber, never quite stretching as far as you'd like them to. Thanks to this book, it's now possible to quantify exactly what I'm missing out on during such nights, as scientists have mapped more of the neurochemical processes involved than I ever realised: the deep, NREM sleep where memories are carefully transferred from short-term to long-term memory; then the ‘informational alchemy’ of REM-sleep dreaming, which sharpens creativity and conjures up solutions to our daytime problems.The importance of sleep can be further appraised by its evolutionary heritage – it goes back about as far as life on earth. Walker finds that even ‘the very simplest form of unicellular organisms that survive for periods exceeding twenty-four hours, such as bacteria, have active and passive phases that correspond to the light-dark cycle of our planet’. Sleep is about the first thing natural selection locked in for us, and as far as we can tell every animal does it.One always understood that sleep was a healthy thing, but somehow a full night of it is still often viewed as a luxury. On the evidence of this book, it's more like a medical necessity. Given working practices in many parts of the world, this is a big problem, and indeed part of Walker's mission is to explain that much of the developed world is suffering from a serious, chronic sleep deficit which is ultimately ‘a slow form of self-euthanasia’ – he is talking not just to individual sleepers, but to businesses and governments who have some responsibility to take what he says into account.The difference between a four-star book and a five-star one is that while I might love both of them, I can keep a four-star book to myself, whereas a five-star book is one I can't shut up about to everyone around me. On that basis, despite its occasional infelicities, Why We Sleep makes the grade. It's passionate and clearly written, summarises a huge amount of research about which I knew little, and addresses a subject that obviously deserves the attention. It would take someone a lot more cynical than me to read this and not silently decide to make a few lifestyle changes – on which note, if you'll excuse me, I have some intensive, hi-octane pillow time to get to."
8,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"So, this book is both a must read and deeply, deeply disturbing. I’ve been having trouble sleeping for the last few years and now I’m going to have to do something about it, simple as that, because the consequences of not sleeping properly are appalling. For instance, it provides you, free of charge, with an increased risk of diabetes, dementia (in all its fun and various guises), weight gain, heart disease and even accidental death. And the situation is getting worse. We are losing sleep at a rate of knots as we squeeze the nights from both ends. Add to that the fact that our world is now awash with night-time blue light – the frequency of light we have used to tell us it is day-time ever since before we were even fish – and this particular self-created train wreck just keeps a-roll’n along.There were times in this where he would say things and I would think, ‘oh yeah, see that, you’ve gone too far this time’ – for instance, his saying that driving with a sleep deficit is worse than driving while drunk, having done both, I figured I knew better. But then he justifies this by saying that when you are drunk your reaction times are reduced, but you generally still react – but when you are sleep deprived you drop (without warning) into micro sleeps and while in them you do not react at all. You know, you are asleep. And then he reminds us of the stereotypical truck driver (by the way, in most states in the US, there are more truck drivers than any other occupation). Truck drivers are often over-weight, which is directly correlated with sleep apnoea, that is, a condition likely to increase the number of times you fall into micro-sleeps. Did I mention I found this book terrifying?The other bit of this that really struck me was the correlation between anxiety and a lack of sleep. It is almost as if we are unable to trust people as we get less and less sleep. And this also translates into an inability to lay down new memories – that is, learn things. In fact, something students often do is stay up all night studying for an exam – on the basis of ‘never do today what you can do five minutes before it is almost too late’. But such a lack of sleep is likely to leave them feeling under-confident, anxious and also seriously impaired in their ability to actually learn and remember anything they have spent the night staring blankly at. This is part of the reason why he says the shift in the US towards earlier school starting times is such a bad idea. He presents an evolutionary biology just-so story that goes: adolescents need a safe-ish way to move out of the parental nest. They do this by their body clock shifting so they stay awake later (when their parents are asleep), so they can interact with other young people in a relatively safe environment, and this means they therefore wake later than their parents too. But then we force them out of bed at 6 or earlier to cross town to go to a school that starts at 7am, and getting up at that time feels to them like getting out of bed at 4am, bad things are likely to happen. How can they possibly learn in that state? Whether or not the evolutionary story is right, it does seem teens do need to stay up later and to sleep in longer, and we ought to respect that. It also seems there is such a thing as night-owls, and our forcing them to work at the crack of dawn is just as cruel and just as stupid as our forcing teenagers to do the same thing.You need to get hold of this book and to read it – and it is written by someone who does research in the field, so, not just some random guy who likes nice good sleep-in in the morning and figures you should like it too. I can’t tell you how many times I thought while reading this, ‘oh, for god’s sake’. This was not the mirror I felt I needed to look into at the moment, but then, I guess that means it is exactly the mirror I needed to look into."

this excerpt
 from the beginning of this book (p3-5), and you will understand why this book caught my attention. This book is divided into four parts. Part 1 defines the nature and types of sleep, describes how the need for sleep changes over a life span, and goes on to discuss the evolutionary origins of sleep. Part 2 describes why you should sleep and lays out the dire consequences of not sleeping. Part 3 explains how and why we dream, and Part 4 takes on the broader societal issues in dealing with sleep needs. An Appendix is included for ""Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep.""The primary message of this book is to emphasize the importance of adequate sleep. There are some suggestions included for obtaining adequate sleep, but the primary message is why it's important for health. An indication of how important is that lab mice that are deprived of sleep die sooner than those deprived of food. The book ties the lack of sleep to numerous illnesses, and then proceeds to make the case that lack of sleep is either the cause or part of a negative feedback loop making the illness worse. By describing physiological and neurological interactions the author is able to show how lack of sleep is involved in these processes. Then population and diseases statistics are referenced to verify the involvement sleep or lack of sleep.For many readers of this book the author will come across as an alarmist because he takes issue with so many things that we assume to be part of normal life. He makes a case that the early hours for beginning school makes no sense for optimum student performance. He sites one study that showed the average IQ of students in a school district was increased by starting school later. The author also makes a case for ending the practice of giving medical interns long work hours. Some readers will not appreciate the negative things that the author has to say about caffeine and alcohol. Incidentally, if you think alcohol helps you to sleep you need to see what this book has to say about that.The following are four things I learned from this book that I decided are worth highlighting here:1. Sleep is the process by which the body removes waste products of metabolism from the brain. (This includes amyloid proteins which are associated with Alzheimer disease.)2. People who are sleep deprived show reduced sensitivity to insulin. (This is a precursor for diabetes.)3. Sleep deprived people experience hormonal changes that increases hunger and decreases satiation. (This leads of obesity and the resulting consequences including diabetes and heart disease.)4. Sleep plays an important role in changing new memories into long term memories. (Sleep is better than studying all night.)The following are excerpts and quotations taken from the book with my introductory remarks:Are you a night owl or morning lark? Here's 
a link
 to an excerpt (p20-25) on that subject.Here's a link to an excerpt (p68-61) about Biphasic sleep.Lack of sleep is such a common experience for many of us that at first it's hard to believe the case being made by this book: ""...linking it [lack of sleep] to numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, suicide, stroke, and chronic pain), and on every physiological system of the body, further contributing to countless disorders and disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, infertility, weight gain, obesity, and immune deficiency). No facet of the human body is spared the crippling, noxious harm of sleep loss."" (p133) The book makes a convincing case that: ""We are … socially, organizationally, economically, physically, behaviorally, nutritionally, linguistically, cognitively, and emotionally dependent upon sleep."" (p133)I've included the following quotation since it applies to many today who live busy lives, including me somtimes. Researchers have evaluated performance of sleep impaired individuals and have found some sobering facts: Most worrying from a societal perspective, were the individuals in the group who obtained six hours of sleep a night, something that may sound similar to many of you. Ten days of six hours of sleep per night was all it took to become as impaired in performance as going without sleep for twenty-four hours straight. (p136)Here's another quotation that caught my eye:There is no major psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal. This is true of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. (p149)Regarding cardiovascular health:Adults forty-five years or older who sleep fewer than six hours a night are 200% more likely to have a heart attack or stroke during their lifetime, as compared with those sleeping seven to eight hours a night.(p165)Concerned about cancer?…the scientific evidence linking sleep disruption and cancer is so damning that the World Health Organization has officially designated nighttime shift work as a ""probable carcinogen.""(p186)Lack of sleep can leave you more prone to Alzheimers disease."
10,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is such an excellent book, mainly because I had never thought very much about the need for a good night's rest. The first part of this book does not really address ""why we sleep"". Instead, the book describes ""what happens if we do not get enough sleep."" Not until about halfway through the book, does the question ""why we sleep"" really get answered.The author, Matthew Walker, is a professor of neuroscience and psychology. I always prefer to read science-related books that are written by scientists who are actively doing research in the field. They are the most authoritative, and they best understand all of the nuances involved in the interpretation of experimental results. As long as the science book is well written--and this book is definitely written in an engaging style--I always prefer to read a book written by an active researcher.The author divides a night's sleep into two primary portions; the early portion is characterized mostly by NREM (non-REM) sleep, while the later portion is mostly REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movements). Both portions are essential. NREM sleep helps one to cement memories into permanent storage, while REM sleep helps one to apply past experiences to solve problems. If you skimp on either portion, then your brain has a very difficult time recuperating. The book describes, in just the right amount of detail, a host of experiments that have shown the deleterious consequences of insufficient sleep. And, I was 
really surprised
 by the range of consequences, and their seriousness. This book has thoroughly convinced me to make every effort to get a full night's sleep; at least 7 hours, and preferably 8 hours.I am not going to try to recap the myriad consequences of insufficient sleep. Suffice it to say, they are truly scary. This is a fascinating book, and I highly recommend it to everyone who sleeps.I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook version, as narrated by Steve West. He does a very good job keeping my interest throughout his narration."
11,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23253765-kamil,3,"There's an overwhelmingly positive experience I had with this book. For most of it, Walker talks about his research (and his colleagues) surrounding the sleep and those arguments are fascinating and convincing. However, there are moments, mostly closer to the end of it, when you feel like you are listening to a sales pitch. First of all, I dislike when somebody uses percentage without reference, ie ""it's a 150% growth"" as it might easily mean it was 1% in the past and now is 2,5% (150% growth), which in some situation might be significant in others not at all. Second, the seek for real-life examples of dangers of the lack of sleep was on the border of simplification, as even though I didn't research it I'm pretty sure (due to the simple application of logic) that most outcomes are caused by a conglomerate of factors. When he talked about a drop in teenage accidents when school hours were moved one hour later, I couldn't stop thinking, that maybe it's not all necessary due to the fact that they drive better being well rested. For sure that's a factor but maybe if school started at 9, the hour most of the office jobs start, maybe some parents would drive the kids to school. This is just an example but that was bugging me.When he mentions in passing Chernobyl disaster and blames it on lack of sleep, I was thinking it's such a shame that he sells himself so short, as this book is a great scientific study of sleep while this argument is just bananas. Sure tiredness played some role but the disaster was mostly caused by inherent design flaws and violation of safety measures. All in all, a good read, just bear in mind he probably has a good intention in mind but is sometimes a bit blinded by his agenda."
12,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,4,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription “The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night’s sleep.”🌟 I am still on a quest to discover more non-fiction books, that started last year and I am willing to continue this year. So when Tala (Who also happens to be a medical student in my class) recommended this, I knew that I had to read it!🌟 I also had the same first question that most of us will think of: How a ~370 pages book is filled with things on sleep?! This book answered many questions that I had thought about in my long sleepless nights. It explains why do we need to sleep, the evolutionary role of sleep, why do we dream and what are the benefits of dreaming, Why do we as teenagers and new adults like to go to sleep late while adults go early, why do you feel tired after you pull an all-nighter but then gradually get energized! And one of my favorite things is explaining why we like to keep one foot out of the bed at night!!🌟 What is cooler about this is that it does so in a simple language that everyone can understand. No need to be in the medical field to do so. If you are interested in sleep then you should read this!🌟 One of my professors once told me that people like to view the world in what they are best at. So a doctor will see everything as physiology and pathology, an engineer will see things as equations, numbers and drawings, a chemist will announce the secret of life as Alchemy. So a sleep scientist will explain everything by -you guessed it- Sleep!As much as I enjoyed the book, I thought it was trying too much sometimes! There was a graph depicting the relationship between Obesity and sleep and it shows that through the years we have been sleeping less and thus becoming more obese. Which has a certain truth to it but we can not ignore the changes in food and lifestyles too!🌟 Also the author would tell you that if you don’t sleep well (I assure you that 99% of us don’t) then you will get Alzheimer, cancers, obesity, diabetes and all sort of things… If you find this idea uncomfortable then you may want to skip this.🌟 Summary & Prescription: I really enjoyed this book as much as I expected to. It is kind of scientific but still awesome to read. I like that the author provided concrete evidence -Although I want to discuss some things further more- through the book and that it was not all theories. I recommend this for all of you looking for a non-fiction book and are interested in Sleep!Happy reading and Sleep tight I guess?"
13,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"You know, I'm not usually one to tout NY Times bestsellers, but in this particular case, I want to mention that...This kinda should be required reading for everyone. Why? Because despite the rather innocuous title and no-nonsense factual information being presented, with no less than 750 scientific studies supporting the findings within, the author OUGHT to have been screaming that we're all freaking fools and morons.Sure, I've heard of some of the studies, such as the ones related to the huge probability of obesity and depression and cancer rates for people who don't get 8 hours of sleep, but when we see all the other facts involved with it are all laid out, I frankly despair. Our societies are made up of complete idiots. Most of the most powerful and necessary REM sleep happens in the last block of sleep, between 6-8 hours. Most of us are reducing our sleep to 6 or less. Learning and retention and memory decrease as if you're constantly drunk, and the long-term effects short circuit all rational behaviors. We eat more because we act high. We get into more car accidents. Test performance is abysmal, as is our moods, our ability to digest foods properly, and our ability to resist the flu drops from an 18% chance at 8 hours of sleep to a whopping 50% chance when you get less than 6 hours. These are studies, based on people who, in a controlled environment, are swabbed with the sick. Think about that. Add VERY significant numbers to cancer, suicide, and total life dissatisfaction, and the picture becomes very dire.Oh, and sleeping pills short-circuit the REM cycle. As do drugs for ADHD. This is the funniest and most horrible thing I picked up here: Teens all have a natural change in their circadian rhythm. They all become night owls. So WTF are we forcing them to get up earlier and earlier to go to school? They AREN'T getting enough sleep. So what happens? They go in, do abysmally in school, show all the same symptoms as ADHD, get diagnosed with ADHD, and then get drugs to help them concentrate while only making the fundamental problem of not getting enough REM sleep WORSE.*slow clap*Idiots.And I'm talking about ALL of us. Long term sleep deprivation is the thing we do to TORTURE PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE. And yet, there's this thing about rewarding long work cycles, turning people in unthinking zombies with decreasing work productivity JUST BECAUSE we're trying to squeeze out that last hour of work? It's KILLING US. Literally. Our minds aren't working well enough to even realize there's a problem. Put a STOP to this! Seriously, folks! This is right up there with dancing around in a cloud of radium. Oh, look, it's so pretty!This is science, folks. Not a fad. Don't be an idiot."

Overall, it’s quite good and the content is original. This book highlights the benefits of nine hours of sleep and how it is imperative to live a healthy life and do excellent academically. I didn’t think you could write so much over the research on sleeping. I do hope Walker appears on Joe Rogan’s podcast again to remind people to sleep more!"
15,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,5,"Why we Sleep by Sleep Scientist, Matthew Walker was totally BRILLIANT!Matthew Walker is a British Sleep Scientist and Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at Berkeley – and it shows. Essentially everything Professor Walker asserts is backed up by evidence. More often than not, he not only states the source but will explain the details of the studies in question to explain his statements. It is just so well done – all easy to read, all so well explained.But this is all very well. It wouldn’t matter a Tinker’s Cuss if the message wasn’t so compelling. We need 8 hours of sleep per night.His introduction of why we sleep and how others in the animal kingdom sleep is fascinating. Facts like, some animals can sleep with only half their brains – WHAT?? – yes, half their brains, so the other half can keep the ‘body’ functioning. So, some aquatic mammals sleep with one half while the other is alert and keeping the animal swimming, otherwise they’d sink I suppose. The most interesting fact in this part for me was the line of birds whereby the bird on the left edge would have its left eye open and that half of its brain awake and open for business. All the other birds in line would be fast asleep, and the bird on the other end of the line to the right would have its right eye open and alert and half of its brain awake. How amazing is that? We humans think we’re clever!We need 8 hours of sleep per night.One other repeated message in this book is, we spend the first half of our night in light nREM and deep nREM sleep and then the second half in REM sleep. (REM = Rapid Eye Movement, as many of us know). In nREM sleep our brainwaves are slow, steady and predictable and in REM sleep our brainwaves are all over the shop like when we are awake. This REM period is when we dream, in my case pretending I am playing football for England or starring in the latest Series of Fleabag as the dishy Priest or being chased by Magpies. Both nREM and REM periods serve essential functions, for example, REM sleep helps with setting our memories from the previous day, re-igniting synapse connections, amongst so many other things – without which we can become sick. Yep sick.We need 8 hours of sleep per night.Regarding the amount of sleep we must have; the author says ”….humans (and all other species) can never ‘sleep back’ the sleep we have previously lost” He later goes on to explain the sad consequences of this, especially if it’s chronic – and it is frightening and true.We need 8 hours of sleep per night.It was also interesting to learn that those countries who gave up their regular siestas (something I love to do on the weekend) went on to suffer a 37 percent increase risk of death from heart disease, relative to those who maintained afternoon naps.We need 8 hours of sleep a night.I really don’t want to keep sprouting facts and passages from this book, otherwise there’s no point in you reading it. But if you’re interesting in being convinced about the importance of getting a solid 8 hours sleep a night (have I mentioned that?), and the effects substances like alcohol (this is frightening), sleeping tablets, other substances and the results of sleep deprivation (it can be lethal) and the myriad of conditions that ensue from lack of sleep. I highly recommend this book. We need 8 hours sleep a night.I am fortunate enough to read papers, studies and various journals in my line of work, and am always on the look out for outlandish, evidence-absent conclusions. But this book has sold me, look. During the time I have read this – I have made a point of sleeping by 11pm (with a book of course) and waking at around 7am – and each day I have felt as BRIGHT AS A BUTTON!! Still feel buggered late afternoon thought – that’s because I’m not getting any younger.I have become a born-again sleeper and will tell everyone I know – and I can tell it’s wearing thin. But it is SO important.Love this book, massive fan of this guy.5 StarsMany, many thanks to Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this wonderful book in return for an honest and objective review."
16,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Sleep has been a big mystery for long, as it has been unclear what purpose it serves, and why natural selection did not weed it out. After all, in earlier times, the period of sleep must have been one of considerable danger for humans (and even now for many animals and birds). And yet, sleep is a common requirement across the animal kingdom as well. In fact, birds and some sea creatures have the remarkable ability to sleep half a brain at a time. Matthew Walker is a sleep scientist and does an exceptional job in this book of explaining what sleep achieves for us. In fact, sleep deprivation is extremely dangerous and there is not enough awareness of this. Modern lifestyle has dealt a blow to both our duration and quality of sleep, and the effects are already quite apparent.While sleep has not completely revealed all its mysteries to us, a lot is now known after painstaking research over several years. Our sleep shuffles between NREM, Light and REM sleep – and all of them have their purpose. NREM sleep fortifies our memory helping in longer term recall, while REM sleep & dreams lend emotional balance and help us get to the big picture. The book discusses a large number of experiments detailing what happens when we skip sleep. Depending on the sleep cycle and the quantum of deprivation, the ill effects are nothing short of disastrous – lower immunity, failing memory, loss of emotional balance, pre-disposition to serious diseases such as diabetes, dementia and even cancer. Getting adequate sleep (~8 hours) on the other hand makes people more creative & productive other than being healthy.Somehow, our cultures today do not emphasise the importance of sleep, as much as we do exercise and diet. So much so, that sleeping less is mistakenly regarded as a confirmation of working hard and being more ambitious. The assumption that each of us can do with varying periods of sleep is largely a myth as well. While a genetic mutation allows a few to function effectively with around 6 hours of sleep, this is extremely rare. Almost all of us do need ~8 hours of sleep. There are tips on improving sleep quantity as well as quality all through the book, such as regulating caffeine in the later part of the day. Most of us are guilty of not according sleep the importance it deserves, and this book is an eye opener. This is a book everyone should read. There are very important points of note for individuals, educational institutions, hospitals, organisations and even governments."
17,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,"Hands down, one of the best books I read this year (more like ever, to be honest). So, a miracle drug has been discovered. A revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory, makes you more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Sleep! Who would have imagined?! And on the other hand, failing to get this drug will result in extensive damage to your overall health, and no aspect of your biology would be left unscathed. Sleep deprivation! Many of us are bizarrely convinced that getting by with constantly less hours of sleep is actually a sign of coolness and exceptional abilities to function as a super-human. Due to this utter ignorance about the importance and the complexity of sleep’s role in our lives, we do a great disservice to ourselves and mostly to our children, who grow up with the notion that getting enough sleep could be labeled as laziness. Instead, we should realize that our sleeping hours are not an endless resource from which we can borrow limitless amounts of time ""to do productive work"", as I personally very often do (I really wished to be able to say ""did"", but alas, I've only managed to lightly reduce this vice). They are not. And the work of a sleep deprived person isn't as productive as one'd imagine. Eventually the constant low level exhaustion becomes our accepted norm. We fail to recognize how our habitual state of sleep deficiency has come to compromise our mental aptitude and physical vitality, resulting in the slow accumulation of ill health. I picked up this book with an inquiring mind, perhaps hoping to find a technique or two to improve my sleep, after obtaining a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms. As it turns out, it gave me nightmares. Still, I'm glad that I got this insight before I die a depressed, obese, demented diabetic, because I ""must"" work late or I ""must"" watch the silly movie till the end, well beyond midnight. Next, I'm reading ""Go the fuck to sleep"". "

I can't even begin to detail all the amazing - yet terrifying - facts I learned while listening to Why We Sleep. And I always KNEW us night owls were at a disadvantage when it came to the normal 9-5 lifestyle - our body clock simply does not conform to the universal circadian rhythm, and we CANNOT help it, contrary to popular belief. The amount of research and studies compiled for this book is staggering!There is no doubt that this is an incredibly important and necessary book, but my god, some parts were terribly dry. Usually I love listening to non-fiction as I find myself able to digest the information more readily, however in this case I wonder if I would have benefited from reading a physical copy. I studied sleep during my pharmacy degree, but even then I still feel like small manageable chunks would be a better way to read this one! 3.5 stars."
19,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"We often hear that sleep, diet and exercise are the three pillars of health, but Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, goes further: he believes sleep is the platform on which diet and exercise rest. Getting 7–9 hours of sleep a night is not some luxury to aim for but an absolute essential for the brain to process new information and prepare for receiving more the next day. Dreaming is like overnight therapy, and fuels creativity. Sleep deprivation has been associated with dementia and cancer: it’s no accident that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, who prided themselves on getting by on just five hours of sleep a night, both developed Alzheimer’s. Just a few nights of insufficient sleep can weaken the immune system and increase the risks of developing a serious illness. It’s no wonder Walker calls sleep loss an epidemic.Here are some other facts I gleaned:During primate evolution, the transition to sleeping on the ground instead of in trees meant we could sleep more deeply – not having to worry about falling out – and the resulting increase in REM sleep and dreams contributed to the development of complex culture and creativity.Fetuses are asleep most of the time; they kick in their sleep. Alcohol use during pregnancy or breastfeeding can lead to a decline in the offspring’s sleep quality or quantity.People with autism get 30–50% less REM sleep than neurotypical people.The postprandial slump in energy many of us experience is evolutionarily inbuilt, and suggests that a short nap (30–40 minutes) would be natural and beneficial. For instance, some African tribespeople still regularly nap at the hottest point of the day.Walker’s sleep tips are mostly common-sense stuff you will have heard before. His #1 piece of advice is to have a sleep schedule, always going to sleep and waking up at the same time. (“Catching up” on weekends doesn’t work, though napping before 3 p.m. can.) Set an alarm for bedtime so you’ll stick to it, he suggests.It’s a fairly long and dense book, with smallish type and scientific figures, so I knew I was unlikely to read the whole thing, but enjoyed mining it for fascinating information about evolution, neuroscience and child development.Originally published, along with some personal reflections, on my blog, Bookish Beck."
20,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,3,"This is going to sound naive but it still surprises me that so many scientists can be so vain. I like to imagine them outside and above such concerns but of course they aren´t: they´re as human as the rest of us. They want to win prizes, ""go down in history"", have students applaud them in lectures and be popular.Walker is Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and tours, lectures and writes on sleep and sleep science. This book - which can be read in or out of order - covers all the topics you would expect (Why We Sleep, Why We Dream, etc) and if there is a message it is that modern life and modern technology (not to mention pills, booze and other drugs) are affecting our natural sleep patterns and having grave societal consequences.The problem for me with the book is the style. This book is popular science by numbers and, while informative and, in a few cases, enlightening, it is on the whole exactly what every other popular science book is like. There are the ""let me make this simple for you"" analogies. There are the descriptions of experiments included as evidence as ""ingenious"", ""clever"", ""fascinating"". There is the slightly over-baked flagwaving on behalf of a subject - in this case - ""sleep"" which sometimes tips over into ridiculousness (Walker says at one point that life´s natural state is sleep, not wakefulness, although he almost immediately takes it back).I don´t know. Maybe I just took it wrong. Maybe I just don´t sleep enough (my neighbours woke me this morning banging about at 6am) and as I write that I can almost hear Walker humming and rubbing his hand through his fringe and saying, ""ya see? ya see?""Too much popular and not enough science for me."

26,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"Holy crap what an AMAZING book! I looooooved this. I had no idea how important sleep was to us... Everyone should read this. There is such a lack of education from sleep. Sleep is more important than diet and exercise. As an adult you need between7-9hr of sleep per night. Sleeping pills don't do shit. Youth and elderly need sleeping the most. If you don't allow teenagers their much needed sleep it increases the chance they will have a mental conditional, higher chance of suicide and so much more. There was one guy who literally couldn't sleep, he didn't sleep for 10 months and he actually died. He just shrivelled away into nothing, he wasn't even able to talk, he just turned into a zombie. Sleep rejuvenates us, it cleans up the mess we made when we're awake and we learn and process everything from the day.Some plants have circadian rhythm which means plants in total darkness will still bloom during day time and close up at night even with no sunHumans circadian Rhythms actually 24 hours and 15min but that’s too confusing to work with so we use 24hrWe all synchronize with daylight, sun goes up, sun goes down. Also repeating food, exercise, temperature fluctuation, even regularly timed social interaction can set your clockDecaf doesn’t mean no caffeine it’s about 30% caffeine still in thereHalf life of a drug means how many hours did it take for the drug to be 50% gone from the system and for caffeine that’s about 5-7hr. So if you have a coffee at 6pm that means 50% of it is still in your system at 1-2am. You loose the jolt though"

Great book! I have to admit, I skipped a few chapters due to my incompetence in sleep science. But I am still rating it 5* stars since it was a great and interesting read. In my opinion M.P.Walker said everything about sleep that could be said. The thing I liked the most was the style - it had a flowing continuity that was easy to understand for an average reader (I like stuff called popular science, but some authors just write pure science that is hard and complicated, and makes you sleepy too...) M.P.Walker manages to address even the oddest facts of sleep with fun and yet scientific attitude. The examples he chooses are relevant and relatable, author know how to make a point without preaching. You will get a tons of arguments to explain people why you are an owl, why school should start later, why you shouldn't take sleeping pills, and damn, why we sleep. "
28,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I am obsessed with learning about sleep, and sleep hygiene. I will read article after article on the topic, even if it's just regurgitating the same old stuff. It just feels calming to me. Despite that though, I'm quite bad at practicing what I preach (to my husband and anyone else who will listen).This book is anything but calming however. In fact, it will put the fear of god into you. It is however the most informative text I have ever read on the topic of sleep and dreams, and I believe it will have a genuine effect on how I go about prioritising sleep from now on.It can be a touch dry at times, particularly in the first few chapters, but it is at the same time utterly fascinating. The amount of facts I have regurgitated to family and friends while reading this book is ridiculous. I drank up the knowledge this book gave me, the crazy research experiments, the humour that Matthew Walker exhibits. And often I gave into sleep after reading only a few pages at a time - not because I was bored mind you, but because the author gave me permission to. And that is amazing, and something I should give into more often in the future.Well worth a read if you have any interest at all in one of the most basic and necessary of human functions."
29,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"The author, Matthew Walker, makes a compelling case for sleep that frankly even after having read many articles about the importance of sleep, and even watching his TED talk, changed my perspective. It has convinced me that I have likely been under-slept much of the past 10 years (3 kids and a busy job will make it hard), and that has been a negative contributor to my health and well being. Specifically, I have always been of the belief that I am a person who can subsist on 6-7 hours of sleep, but this book makes me believe I need to be getting 8, and that the difference is material to both my mental and physical health. ""Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours.""But more so, it warns of a global sleep epidemic. And this really rings true. Sleep is something we spend (if we are doing it right), a third of our lives doing, and which should be put up there with eating well and exercising. And yet how often have you heard recommendations for eating well and exercising that don't also include a recommendation to sleep enough? The book makes a strong case that we are vastly under educating people about the benefits of sleep. This sentence for instance, both rings true and is one of the scariest in the book: ""With chronic sleep restriction over months or years, an individual will actually acclimate to their impaired performance, lower alertness, and reduced energy levels. That low-level exhaustion becomes their accepted norm, or baseline. Individuals fail to recognize how their perennial state of sleep deficiency has come to compromise their mental aptitude and physical vitality, including the slow accumulation of ill health. A link between the former and latter is rarely made in their mind. Based on epidemiological studies of average sleep time, millions of individuals unwittingly spend years of their life in a sub-optimal state of psychological and physiological functioning, never maximizing their potential of mind or body due to their blind persistence in sleeping too little.""If this isn't an epidemic, what is? Like me, many of us have a notion that we should work hard during the week and ""catch up"" later or (pre-kids) on the weekend. Interestingly, this notion is false - we can never catch up, the damage has been done.""More than 65 percent of the US adult population fail to obtain the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night during the week.""It's not just our culture of working too hard and looking at screens too much, there are a few specific cultural things the book rants against. First (and in my opinion, justified) is a rant against schools that have start times that are too early - teenagers in particular still have forming brains and need their sleep. Second and most ironic is our medical schools culture of 24 or 48 hour shifts - the medical community should know better, and if they don't, it's no wonder the rest of us don't take it seriously enough. Unnecessarily bankrupting the sleep of a teenager could make all the difference in the precarious tipping point between psychological wellness and lifelong psychiatric illness. This is a strong statement, and I do not write it flippantly or without evidence.""I used to go to Terman Library all the time - and as a parent this was fascinating:""The Stanford psychologist Dr. Lewis Terman, famous for helping construct the IQ test, dedicated his research career to the betterment of children’s education. Starting in the 1920s, Terman charted all manner of factors that promoted a child’s intellectual success. One such factor he discovered was sufficient sleep. Published in his seminal papers and book Genetic Studies of Genius, Terman found that no matter what the age, the longer a child slept, the more intellectually gifted they were. He further found that sleep time was most strongly connected to a reasonable (i.e., a later) school start time: one that was in harmony with the innate biological rhythms of these young, still-maturing brains.""So why do we sleep? One big reason is that it literally stores your memories from the day - it moves them from short term to long term storage, and if you don't get good sleep, you just lose the memories! I shudder to think of how many classes I crammed for during college on no sleep and then promptly forgot it all :(. The phrase ""let me sleep on it"" exists in every culture because it works - our brains will be better on a problem the following day, because the information has been moved to long term storage, and intermingled with our neural net of everything else in our brains. ""Of the many advantages conferred by sleep on the brain, that of memory is especially impressive, and particularly well understood. Sleep has proven itself time and again as a memory aid: both before learning, to prepare your brain for initially making new memories, and after learning, to cement those memories and prevent forgetting.""""Before having slept, participants were fetching memories from the short-term storage site of the hippocampus—that temporary warehouse, which is a vulnerable place to live for any long duration of time if you are a new memory. But things looked very different by the next morning. The memories had moved. After the full night of sleep, participants were now retrieving that same information from the neocortex, which sits at the top of the brain—a region that serves as the long-term storage site for fact-based memories, where they can now live safely, perhaps in perpetuity.""When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).""One fascinating insight was the studies that showed that the last 2 hours of sleep (from hour 6 to 8) were some of the most key hours for deep NREM sleep, which does your memory storage. When you short those by only getting 6 hours, it matters a lot!""The increases in speed and accuracy, underpinned by efficient automaticity, were directly related to the amount of stage 2 NREM, especially in the last two hours of an eight-hour night of sleep"". The bits about physical performance for athletes was solidly backed and fascinating. I'd heard that ""Federer gets 9-10 hours"" and the such for similar top performers, but this backed it up - you really do perform 30-50% better with more sleep, AND recover 30-50% better with more sleep the next night.""Obtain anything less than eight hours of sleep a night, and especially less than six hours a night, and the following happens: time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30 percent, and aerobic output is significantly reduced. Similar impairments are observed in limb extension force and vertical jump height, together with decreases in peak and sustained muscle strength.""The book had several convincing chapters about the improved health risks of sleeping more. It reduces chances of cancer and probably about everything else, since sleep is what helps your body repair itself. These bits were scary to read, and intended to be so. His ""convincer"", that he opened his TED Talk with, is that men who are sleep deprived have 30% reduced sperm count, lower testosterone, and smaller testicles. ""Poor sleep quality therefore increases the risk of cancer development and, if cancer is established, provides a virulent fertilizer for its rapid and more rampant growth. Not getting sufficient sleep when fighting a battle against cancer can be likened to pouring gasoline on an already aggressive fire.""Another scary stat is that Drowsy Driving is worse than Drunk Driving. How much education and laws do we have about drunk driving, and yet being drowsy is the cause of more vehicle accidents than being drunk! Time to shift our education and perhaps our laws.While the book was great at the science of what we know about sleep, it didn't go enough into what is known about how to improve sleep. But it did have good high level tips: Key Tips to Improve Sleep1. Reduce electric and LED light. Simply put, we weren't designed to stay up until midnight, and so reducing light, especially harmful blue light, will let us get to sleep easier. This means creating mood lighting hours before bedtime to start to suppress melatonin. Wear blue light glasses, especially if looking at any screens after dinner, and avoid screens 2 hours before bedtime. ""A subtly lit living room, where most people reside in the hours before bed, will hum at around 200 lux. Despite being just 1 to 2 percent of the strength of daylight, this ambient level of incandescent home lighting can have 50 percent of the melatonin-suppressing influence within the brain.2. Keep a cool bedroom, cooler than you think: A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard bedding and clothing.""3. Establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends: ""if you can only adhere to one of these each and every day, make it: going to bed and waking up at the same time of day no matter what. It is perhaps the single most effective way of helping improve your sleep, even though it involves the use of an alarm clock.""4. Don't have caffeine after noon as it will be in your system 9 hours later. 5. Avoid or limit alcohol, which has a long half life: ""alcohol fragments sleep, littering the night with brief awakenings. Alcohol-infused sleep is therefore not continuous and, as a result, not restorative.""6. Don't eat within 4 hours of bedtime. 7. Don't exercise within 2-3 hours of bedtime. 8. Have a completely black sleeping environment: Maintaining complete darkness throughout the night is equally critical, the easiest fix for which comes from blackout curtains.""9. Have a hot bath or shower before bed: ""Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults"".I did want more tips on beating jet lag, which the book didn't really go into, other than to say it will take 1 day to adjust 1 hour, so it takes a week to adjust to a move from the US to EU (which I knew).I bought an Oura ring after reading this book, which gives great data and graphs about my sleep, but I am still struggling to get high Oura scores. So I'm still looking for what works for me. But now I'm committed to striving for 8 hours a night instead of 7, which has already made a big difference!"
30,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,5,"If you've ever slept you should read this book.I always thought that sleep was a waste of time which drains away about a third of our life. So why bother with it? Why would I not sleep as little as possible and spend my waking time doing things I like?Well, it seems that there are a throng of reasons why we shouldn't do this, all of them drawn from scientific research.Let me illustrate this with a quote from the book: “Scientists have discovered a revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory, makes you more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?”Yep, that's what sleep does and guess what: you're probably doing it wrong. The tricky part is that both quantity and quality matter.The book guides you on the journey to sleep better and improve your quality of life tremendously.Given the fact that we spend so much of our life sleeping, I highly recommend this book in order to understand sleep better and improve it. "
31,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"This is artful science-writing, except that the science seems sketchy. It is fishy, especially in the context of the author's lambasting of Big Pharma, that he is a self-styled entrepreneur (https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/entrepr...) working with Fitbit and Google, presumably on the types of gadgets he recommends in the book. Nerd addendum:The general point is reasonable: people should get enough sleep. Fine -- that hardly requires a book. The potential plus-value here is the fear-mongering to motivate people to get more sleep, but I found his scare-stories frustratingly kooky. For example, the idea that zillions of lives would be saved by flu vaccine if only people got enough sleep is an enormous stretch. It is dangerous in general to extrapolate from laboratory observations, evolutionary psychology theory or principles of physiology to clinical/health policy recommendations. Yet much of the book is gee-whiz reporting on animal studies and ""neurobollocks"" research (see: Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience.)Also, the problems of people who suffer from true sleep disorders are different from the general public problem of poor sleep hygiene. For example, people with debilitating insomnia may benefit from cutting out all caffeine, but even if that were true the evidence presented in the book doesn't justify telling everyone to do that.Although I don't agree with all its points, the following article catalogs important problems in the book: https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/. Other low-score Goodreads reviews list other non-facts. Some might find Guzey's tone off-putting but I try to focus on evidence and I appreciate that he makes verifiable statements of fact. One of Guzey's main falsifiable claims is that there's a U-shaped curve of mortality vs. sleep duration. He gives references to the peer-reviewed scientific literature. I checked one from the journal Sleep (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...) and it does say what he says it says: ""In the pooled analysis, short duration of sleep was associated with a greater risk of death (RR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18; P < 0. 01) ... . Long duration of sleep was also associated with a greater risk of death (1.30; [1.22 to 1.38]; P < 0.0001) ... . Conclusion: Both short and long duration of sleep are significant predictors of death in prospective population studies."" This one fact by itself is a huge problem for Walker's book.I think that in science, substance needs to matter more than surface. "

It is also the reason why it took me 19 days to finish this 360  pages long book - reading became luxury for me (let's hope that will change for better soon).Like the author has mentioned at the very beginning of this non-fiction, you can read Why We Sleep as a whole, or each part of it separately.I read every word, including acknowledges (like I always do) and, to me, the most interesting part was the third one, which talks about REM seep and dreams.I always knew dreams were important, and having read about it makes me appreciate them even more.I also want to stress out how surprised I was to learn how sleep deprivation takes it's toll on society.I wish more people would be educated about importance of sleeping, because in our society time we spend on sleep is looked as time that we could use better, when in reality it is the time we spend well.Because of that reason, I wish more people would read this book.Read this and more reviews on my blog https://bookdustmagic.com "

I had a techy friend block the wifi on my home router from 8pm until morning, then I bought a data disabling add-on from my phone carrier for my cell phone to lock that too, and I began to measure my smartwatch sleep metrics like workout results; look at me, nine hours! I also procured the book and fell asleep to it quite a few times, which might be a twisted compliment to the author. The other day at dinner with a friend, while discussing this book, he said ""isn't it amazing that for all the science we have, we don't actually know why we sleep?""I, the newfound Sleep Police, said we do know, since the book I was reading was actually titled ""Why We Sleep"". And then I began to fumble. I realized that for all the interesting bits of insight into sleep science that can be found in this book, I didn't walk away with a logical, concrete answer to why we sleep; I finished the book and still don't know what mental processing occurs in our sleep that could not have been accomplished otherwise; what really happens when we dream, the neuroscience and evolutionary explanation of the brain blacking out for hours on end. I can't say I didn't glean valuable insight, but Walker is more the preacher than the explainer, and that left me disappointed. I do value the author's mission and I think it's topical in an age of blue-light obsession, but it felt incomplete. I was promised a book on why we sleep and got instead one that should be titled ""go to bed, kids!"""

This book is a fascinating look at the purpose and benefits of sleep, including the importance of different stages in the sleep cycle. The author describes the myriad of physical and mental health problems that can be caused by a lack of sleep, as well as the ways in which our modern lives contribute to a society wide sleep deficit. The scientific content is well explained and injected with occasional humour, making this a very readable book. I have always been aware of the importance of sleep to my own personal wellbeing but this book backs up my intuitive sense of this with sound scientific reasoning and I will certainly continue to carefully guard my sleep opportunities!"
38,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,2,"[The following review is too credulous: I wrote it before it became clear that the book is at best a noble-lie exaggeration and at worst statistical fraud with unjustified practical claims. Downgrade your credence in all nonfiction that's outside your expertise, including reviews like this one.]Walker: 
	Scientists have discovered a revolutionary treatment that makes you live longer. It enhances your memory and makes you more creative. It makes you look more attractive. It keeps you slim and lowers food cravings. It protects you from cancer and dementia. It wards off colds and the flu. It lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke, not to mention diabetes. You’ll even feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious. Are you interested?
Important topic: he claims there's a free, riskless intervention to add years to your lifespan and fundamentally improve your mind. (The flip side of this claim is a horror story about a society that mentally disables its members.)Our school system, ladies and gents:
	More than 80 percent of public high schools in the United States begin before 8:15 a.m. Almost 50 percent of those start before 7:20 a.m. School buses for a 7:20 a.m. start time usually begin picking up kids at around 5:45 a.m. As a result, some children and teenagers must wake up at 5:30 a.m., 5:15 a.m., or even earlier, and do so five days out of every seven, for years on end. This is lunacy...	Previously, we noted that the circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day? Would you be in a cheerful mood? Would you find it easy to get along with your coworkers and conduct yourself with grace, tolerance, respect, and a pleasant demeanor? Of course not. Why, then, do we ask this of the millions of teenagers and children in industrialized nations?
And elsewhere he notes that time in school is useless without restfulness. Burn it down.
	Insufficient sleep has also been linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression, violence, psychiatric disturbance, and suicide
The theory of sleep (circadian rhythm and adenosine cycle determining when, NREM and REM determining what) is very neat but I'm not qualified to say if it's mature. There's also vast and baffling cross-species variation, which Walker doesn't pretend to understand: ""amount (e.g., [hours per day]), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic)"" or ground / tree.The adenosine cycle - the absolutely failsafe connection between activity and fatigue - is one of my favourite theories in biology. (The account here doesn't do it justice.)He's sceptical of oral melatonin therapy, but he doesn't consider the main argument in favour, which is that our many hours of blue-light at night is a systematic deviation from ancestral conditions, with no sensible alternative mitigation (f.lux can only do so much). (He instead puts faith in warm LEDs and smart bulbs, currently thousands of dollars each.) At least he doesn't spread the unsupported idea that taking it results in negative hormonal feedback. This doesn't surprise me:
	Scientific evaluations of over-the-counter brands have found melatonin concentrations that range from 83 percent less than that claimed on the label, to 478 percent more than that stated
- but this is the price of having it over-the-counter in the first place. (It is anyway completely safe to take a 6x dose, just much less effective.)He's very in favour of afternoon naps, the ""biphasic"" pattern, based on relatively weak observational evidence:
	those that abandoned regular siestas went on to suffer a 37 percent increased risk of death from heart disease across the six-year period, relative to those who maintained regular daytime naps.""
There's lots of evolutionary speculation, which really pisses off some readers for some reason, even when tagged as speculation. (e.g. Do teenagers stay up later to procreate outwith parental supervision?)He is a crusader all right - for instance, he doesn't really do any cost-benefit consideration, instead just maximising sleep, even instead of taking your asthma meds. Yes, the costs of sleep deprivation are extremely high - but so's the cost of spending 30 years in a coma.I think I'm pretty much optimised: I already quit caffeine, redshifted all screens, got 0.3mg melatonin, started wearing an eye mask, don't drink much, exercise every day, fixed a bedtime, and live somewhere quiet with big bedroom windows. (I also got a less melodramatic and anxious worldview by studying economic history, which Walker doesn't cover - fair enough, since the intervention can only help scared intellectuals.) Things which I enjoy enough to handle the sleep cost: nicotine and eating late. 
Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep:1. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. 3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. 4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. 5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. 6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. 8. Relax before bed... reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.9. Take a hot bath before bed. 10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day.12. Don’t lie in bed awake... get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.

Surprisingly, lack of sleep is linked to decrease in life expectancy.  “...across the cardiac, medical and surgical ICU units, studies consistently demonstrate uniformly bad sleep in all patients.

42,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Some are getting too much, most aren't getting enough. No, I don't mean that; what I am talking about is sleep. There are people out there who seem to be able to exist on almost no sleep, people who are in the office at stupid o'clock in the morning and who are still up way after midnight. While scientists knew that we needed food and water and could explain why, no one could adequately explain why we slept, what purpose it served. It is only recently though that scientists have been able to understand through decades of cutting-edge research just how key sleep is to our health and well-being. In essence, sleep is an essential element to our well being and health and in this book, Professor Matthew Walker sets out just how important it is and how most common diseases in the modern western world have roots deep within our lack of sleep. In this he will explain just what the different sleep types are and how they help us think over deeper and long-term issues, the effects of stimulants on our sleep and why do most teenagers drive like they are missing part of their brain? Because they are… It takes deep sleep and developmental time to accomplish the neural maturation that plugs this brain 'gap' in the frontal lobe. There is a fascinating demonstration on how lack of sleep can affect how we perform; he shows that sleep deprivation can have an equivalent effect to alcohol when driving.Walker recommends that we need around eight hours each night; I normally only have about six hours sleep a night, heading to bed around midnight and being startled into life as the alarm screams at 6.15. Reading this has made me think about the best way to increase that given the potential health benefits of sleep. Did like the fact that a sleep graph is called a hypnogram. Generally, it is very well written too, he takes time to explain in a clear manner the points that he is making but occasionally it drifts towards more academic prose. If you have trouble sleeping or are just fascinated by the way the body works then you should read this."

Insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. Short sleeping increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Perhaps you have also noticed a desire to eat more when you’re tired? This is no coincidence. Too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. Despite being full, you still want to eat more. It’s a proven recipe for weight gain in sleep-deficient adults and children alike. Worse, should you attempt to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since most of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.pp. 27-28:Caffeine is not a food supplement.

For instance, he presents the idea (his) that a primary role of dreaming in REM sleep is to remove the sting of negative affect from personal memories (particularly important, in say post-traumatic stress disorder) as an established fact. Unfortunately, there is very little data to back this claim up; and other ideas about the functions of dreaming remain unmentioned. While his explanation of why we sleep (important given the title of the book) – which involves increasing adenosine levels coupled with circadian rhythms – only explains why we fall asleep at night, but fails to explain the universal desire afternoon naps. Referencing is relatively poor throughout the book, where grand claims are often made with little reference to data. Perhaps particularly egregious is his statement that drinking any alcohol before sleep will substantially damage memory consolidation for days afterwards and that therefore students are advised to give up alcohol altogether!Finally, he keeps pushing the idea all people should sleep optimally eight-hours per night. However, the data he presents is relatively weak on this. Most of the studies presented compare people, say sleeping 4-hours per night (bad) with those sleeping 8-hours per night (good), but in this case it's absolutely not clear whether there is any substantive difference if you sleep say 7-hours per night. On the plus side he does makes a lot of interesting points about the health benefits of sleep. Definitely worth a critical read. 3-stars."

If you are now thinking ""Who the hell has time for eighth hours of sleep a night?"" then you're addressing one of the problems Walker is, too: Our society is constructed in a way that is contra-productive to our biological built. Our children have to be in school at 8 o'clock, we ourselves have to be at work at 9 and don't forget that birthday party this Saturday from which you won't come home until 5 in the morning.What's even worse is that many of us don't even realize that they're not getting enough sleep. We consider the need for coffee and fatigued stay-in-bed-Sundays normal, simply because of daily routines that are forced upon us don't allow us to experience what it's like to actually be rested. I might sound like a brain-washed advocate here, but the truth is that I am one of those people who average on five hours of sleep and never have I considered changing my habits. I like long days and I always felt like I wouldn't get enough stuff done if I slept for longer. But honestly? I'm going back to bed as we speak."
49,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I should warn you: if you already tend towards anxiety about your health and resentment that wage labour forces you to defy your circadian rhythms, this book will worsen both. It’s a fascinating read, though, and I learned a lot about the mechanisms of sleep. Walker’s perspective is that of a research scientist, explaining with engaging enthusiasm and clarity how different aspects of sleep work, or don’t work. At the end, he presents a sort of manifesto for wider recognition of sleep’s importance. What he doesn’t do is commit to blaming neoliberal capitalism for stealing our sleep, as in 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep, a book I highly recommend. Walker’s final chapter argues that sleep-deprived workers are less productive, so there are financial benefits to encouraging better sleep. Unfortunately that isn't the logic of neoliberal capitalism. If profit can be extracted from sleep deprivation, and it definitely can, then it’s likely to continue. While researchers often emphasise the financial benefits of some health improvement (more sleep, exercise, vegetables, etc, etc), I can’t help feeling that these arguments are never going to have much impact. Who would these financial benefits accrue to? Mostly individual workers, who’ll have better quality of life. Who would lose out? Purveyors of junk food, sleeping pills, cars, alcohol, caffeinated drinks, diet books, and so on. Aggregate figures for ‘health savings’ are meaningless unless you consider the vested interests involved. In the case of lost sleep, there are many direct and indirect opportunities for profit. To his credit, Walker does acknowledge that individual lifestyle changes alone are hardly sufficient to deal with a global pandemic of lost sleep; the problem is systemic.Personally, I am a total owl and this book firmly reminded me that there’s nothing to be done about that genetic legacy. Throughout my working life, I’ve depended on caffeine to function in a 9 to 5 routine. By contrast, during my PhD nobody except me cared when (or indeed if) I worked. I wrote my thesis on a midday to 8pm working routine, without caffeine or an alarm clock. As an undergraduate, I used to write essays between 8pm and 4am. Even now, I’m often wide awake at 1am, writing book reviews. Yet getting up at any time before 10am requires an alarm and coffee (the only acceptable caffeinated beverage). That said, I’ve always had a deep respect for sleep and its importance. I simply can’t get away with only six hours a night, and barely with seven. When I drag myself into work on less than six, I look and feel so awful that people comment on it. How anyone copes with that on a regular basis, I simply cannot understand. Given the chance, I sleep for nine hours or more, partially because I get so much enjoyment from dreaming. I have vivid, sometimes lucid, dreams that I usually remember. Sleep and dreaming are great pleasures of life, so its fitting that they have such importance to health and wellbeing, as Walker describes.I must admit, ‘Why We Sleep’ did shame me into resolving to go to bed earlier (...at midnight). While I didn’t find it life-changing, there is at least one friend with a cavalier attitude to sleep that I wish to press it upon. Apparently people consistently underestimate the impact that sleep deprivation has on them. The sections on sleep’s links with brain development in babies and Alzhemer’s disease in the elderly were particularly interesting, as was the discussion of insomnia. The latter certainly made me grateful not to have genuine insomnia, which sounds hellish. It’s very rare that my brain actually forgets how to sleep. Also notable is the comment that the most ‘natural’ sleep rhythm currently known consists of one long sleep at night and a short afternoon nap. Sounds good to me, although my naps tend to take place in the early evening. Maybe one day I’ll get a job that I can do between midday and 8pm. Until then, my top tip for getting more sleep is to compress your morning routine into fifteen minutes so you can set your alarm for as late as possible. If you shower in the evenings and eat breakfast once you get to work, all you need to do before leaving the house is get dressed, comb your hair, and brush your teeth."
50,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Want to know why consistently sleeping less than 8 hours per night puts you at high risk (I forget the figures right now, but very very high) of heart stroke, cancer, depression, obesity, anxiety? Want to know how sleeping less than 8 hours per night shortens your life by more than just a few years? Want to get super angry and realize that the entire Western, industrialized world is pushing for ways of life that overlook the need for sleep? Reading this book, I understood how I never got any proper education on sleep - nor did most in my generation, I don't think. I was told don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs - I was never told that if I don't sleep well enough, everything from my intellectual capacity, to memory, to weight loss, to depression can be severely affected. This book is not one of those self-help paperbacks that people pick up off the shelf, in which you find affirmations you can utter that might help you give up a bad habit. This is science - and it's incredibly scary. All Walker had to do was to list to the reader the scientific research and findings on the benefits of sleeping/dangers of not sleeping, and that's enough to make you want to sleep 8 hours per night for the rest of your life. If you're into science books and living more than 45 years, I totally recommend this read. "

I read the book while at the same time, using a Fitbit to measure, imperfectly of course, my own sleep patterns and found the correlation between the book and my own empirical evidence very strong. "

I took sleep medication for years not realizing the harm it was doing to my body and sleep cycles.I love how technical this book was yet still approachable.I do wish the author had discussed more about dreaming (I was super pumped to read about this topic) and that weird feeling you get of falling right before you fall asleep where you suddenly wake up! I always wanted to know what that was.But I did enjoy the discussion around education start times and the sleeping disorders!I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE!"
53,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59633249-debsd,1,"I was hoping that this would be a book that might be of use to those who (like me) don't sleep well - but it isn't. The only ""advice"" provided is a brief section of the appendix which is based on information from the US National Sleep Foundation. So if you're looking for help (or to ""unlock the power of sleep""), don't read this book.In fairness, however, the blurb doesn't say it's a ""self-help"" book (although with its use of ""transformative"" and ""change our lives for the better"", it's easy to believe it was going after that segment of the market). But setting that aside and considering this book on its merits rather than my expectations, is it a good read? Well...no.This is pretty much a sales pitch for sleep. There is some interesting science in the book, but there is far more theory than real evidence, and unfortunately the author mixes the two together without distinguishing them clearly. He is fascinated by sleep and thinks everyone else should be too - which is probably why he gives so much tiny, tiny, unimportant detail about the methodology of so many bits of research that he mentions (all of which is ""fascinating"" or ""ingenious""). He's convinced that lack of sleep is an important causal factor of everything bad in the world, from car accidents to cancer, from obesity to ingrown toenails. (Okay, that last one might be an exaggeration on my part - but if he'd mentioned ingrown toenails, I'm pretty sure he'd have found a way to blame them on sleep deprivation.) There is way too much preaching, not nearly enough explaining, and almost no critical analysis of any bit of research (or theory/supposition/wondering) which he believes supports his sweeping assertions. The confirmation bias is strong with this one.Zealotry rarely leads to good, balanced argument, and so it is here. There are inconsistencies in his arguments. He frequently extrapolates from animal studies or very small-scale human studies (3 people?!) to justify proclamations about what sleeping or not sleeping does. He confuses anecdote with data. Like many zealots, he manipulates statistics in misleading ways to support his claims - yeah, a 150% growth sounds impressive, but if you don't say what your starting-point is, it's meaningless.There are wild generalisations, some of which have little basis in fact, some of which only serve to uphold unhelpful stereotypes. Example: ""The core symptom of autism is a lack of social interaction. Individuals with autism do not communicate or engage with other people easily."" He states that in teenagers whose brains were scanned, ""a proportion"" (no further detail) went on to develop schizophrenia, and blames this on sleep abnormalities, but provides no compelling evidence that sleep disturbance is contributory rather than correlative.He's rabidly against the use of drugs for manipulating sleep or sleep patterns - whether it's caffeine, alcohol, melatonin or prescription medication (he is particularly bristly about the latter, even referring, more than once, to ""Big Pharma"") - but he doesn't really offer any concrete alternative suggestions, unless you can convince your employer, family, friends and local education system to radically change how they operate.And then there are the important things that he doesn't touch at all. He doesn't discuss, for example, the effects of sleep deprivation on parents of young children. He doesn't address the differences in sleep between men and women. The word ""menopause"" does not occur in this book, despite the fact that menopause can create havoc with sleep patterns.There is some good stuff here, but most of it is fairly obvious, and it's buried under so much fanaticism that it's difficult to spot. What a shame."
54,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57486568-lucy-banks,4,"I received a copy of this book from Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.Detailed yet accessible exploration into all aspects of sleep.As a chronic insomniac, I knew I had to read this as soon as I spotted it on Netgalley. When sleep is elusive, it colours every aspect of your life - from functioning at work to appetite, so I was keen to learn more about it from an expert, and hopefully pick up some tips on how to cut out the dreaded sleeping pills from my life!What was immediately apparent was the accessibility of this book. Right from the start, the tone is engaging and accessible, which really does help when you're wading through quite a complex topic. The information was frequently fascinating, and occasionally alarming. For example, in this book, you'll find out how some animals never 'fully' sleep (I'm looking at you, dolphins!), and how humans have a natural 'sleep rhythm' that doesn't quite match our 21st century lifestyles - no surprise there, eh?The author also covers some worrying topics associated with sleep - not least the damaging effects of sleep deprivation and of sleeping pills. After reading the section on sleeping pills, I vowed to try to wean myself off them (I'm on the third night without taking one now - wish me luck!). Given how many years my husband has been trying to get me to stop taking them, it's quite a miracle that this book got me to finally take the plunge, after just a few days' reading. Believe me - the horrifying nature of these unnatural tablets is enough to put anyone right off!In places, the book did get a little dry, and probably necessarily so, because it's a weighty topic. However, for the most part, it had me keen to read on - and is a definite must-read for anyone with an interest in sleep. "
55,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,"A classic science for the masses book. As one of the masses, I appreciated it. Walker distills many of the salient points from his research about the brain and sleep and writes in a cheerful, approachable manner. Many of the points he unearths mesh with common sense: i.e. sleep deprivation is a form of torture, intellectual success for children is highly tied in with sleep. Other revelations are more slippery: ADHD's symptoms mirror those of sleep deprivation. Or perhaps the most shocking: ""Individuals using prescription sleep medications are significantly more likely to die and to develop cancer than those who do not."" The graphs corresponding to this claim indicated that even using a sleeping pill once a year upped those statistics significantly. I am well versed in chronic sleep deprivation both due to work and family and I think this book is a great reminder for us to consider sleep as one of the pillars of health along with nourishment and exercise. I would not recommend it to new mothers however, as it might be too depressing! "

Whenever I read an interesting assertion in a nonfiction book, I look for references to verify, learn more. I will spend time reviewing the bibliography and footnotes/endnotes in detail. This book has NEITHER. Some of the studies he discusses stretch credulity. Without references, I’m inclined to wonder how much of this is just sloppy creative writing.This is unfortunate, because there is evidence to suggest that we undervalue sleep at the peril of our children and ourselves. It’s too bad this book doesn’t make it easy to find those studies. Based on lack of references and the parts I did get through, the book appears to have been rushed to publication based on topic and author credentials and inadequate in-house editing.

58,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39374372-claudia,4,"“Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day -- Mother Nature's best effort yet at contra-death.”Reading this book actually changed my life. It sounds so ridiculous, so overly dramatic, but it's true; Matthew Walker's incredible book about how important sleep truly is has changed the way I live my life.It's worth pointing out that I read this as an audiobook, and although the narrator did a great job I did find it quite hard sometimes to recall everything that had been said, and often had to rewind to listen through again to fully understand. Me being so tired all the time only made this worse. Because of this I recommend the physical book over the audiobook, since it might be easier to pick everything up properly.As I mentioned before, I'm always tired, and have been for as long as I can remember. I started having trouble sleeping as a very young child, and it actually got so bad that my parents suspected that I had been assaulted. My nightmares aren't so bad anymore, but I still have trouble falling asleep, and wake up several times during the night. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams made me realise just how terrible this is for my health.To summarise it, sleep is the key to almost everything. You don't sleep well and the risks for getting many dangerous diseases increases significantly. Let's just hear some of it from the brilliant Walker himself;“Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic.”“The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. The leading causes of disease and death in developed nations—diseases that are crippling health-care systems, such as heart disease, obesity, dementia, diabetes, and cancer—all have recognized causal links to a lack of sleep.”“Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, more than doubling your risk of cancer.”“It is disquieting to learn that vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined.”“Adults forty-five years or older who sleep fewer than six hours a night are 200 percent more likely to have a heart attack or stroke during their lifetime, as compared with those sleeping seven to eight hours a night.”It's safe to say that this book terrified me into taking my sleep more seriously. In fact, I actually went to get some tests done by a doctor to see if there was anything actually wrong with me, and turns out that I have hypothyroidism. Now, me getting medicated for this isn't going to fix everything alone, but it's a good step on the way and along with me actually taking my sleep schedule more seriously, I'm really hoping to see some good results for my well-being. Although I do still have a long way to go.I truly, truly recommend reading Why We Sleep. It might not be the most excited or heart-pounding read over, but I haven't been able to shut up about this book since I started reading it. Honestly, my partner is so tired of my quoting Walker, but I will continue to do so until he reads this eye-opening book himself."
59,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"Anyone who has ever pulled an all-nighter, or has tried to function effectively after several consecutive nights of restlessness understands the importance of sleep. The scientific evidence is overwhelming. Sleep is crucial to our physical and mental well-being. So much so, in fact, that the UN considers sleep deprivation to be a form of torture. Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams describes the many benefits that sleep confers, the debilitations that lack of sleep can bring, many aspects of the science of sleep, as well as practical tips for improving the duration and restfulness of sleep. This is an important topic because more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis (a minimum of 7 hours) and only 10% of the population prioritizes getting enough sleep over other activities (such as fitness, nutrition, recreation or work). Thus much of the population is sleep deprived on a regular basis. This can lead to negative health consequences, dangerous errors while driving or, at a minimum, extreme irritability before that first (or third) cup of coffee. This is important information for the public to be aware of, but there is a flaw to the book. Walker (professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley) states things as scientific fact, that are anything but settled science. I think this is due to the fact that he considers sleep so all-encompassingly important (possibly more important than actually being conscious) that he thinks it effects everything to do with human existence, all the time, nearly to the exclusion of anything else. This brings to mind the old Monty Python string sketch:Mr. Simpson: But it's only *string*!Wapcaplet: ONLY STRING?! It's everything! It's...it's waterproof!S: No it isn't!W: All right, it's water resistant then!S: It isn't!W: All right, it's water absorbent! It's...Super Absorbent String! ""ABSORB WATER TODAY WITH SIMPSON'S INDIVIDUAL WATER ABSORB-A-TEX STRINGETTES! AWAY WITH FLOODS!""S: You just said it was waterproof!W: ""AWAY WITH THE DULL DRUDGERY OF WORKADAY TIDAL WAVES! USE SIMPSON'S INDIVIDUAL FLOOD PREVENTERS!""S: You're mad!Replace ‘string’ with ‘sleep’ in the above exchange and you have a good idea of what the book is like. In order to bolster his argument that sleep is the most important act that a human can perform, Walker makes what I consider to be fairly dubious claims. These can roughly be placed into 5 categories: 1.	Extrapolating mouse studies to humans as if no differences between species exists (mice who sleep less are more susceptible to cancer, therefore humans are too). The reality is that mice are often not reliable as preclinical models for human disease.2.	Confusing correlation with causation (concluding that people are obese because they sleep poorly even though obese people are more prone to interrupted sleep due to sleep apnea and snoring). Just because two variables have a statistical relationship with each other does not mean that one is responsible for the other.3.	Framing data without the necessary context. For example, Walker makes claims such as the lack of sleep doubles the risk of a certain disease without providing any baseline rate for the disorder. A ‘doubling’ sounds concerning, but if the disease rate were 1 in ten trillion, for example, a doubling of the risk is trivial and something that no one should worry about.4.	Drawing absolute conclusions based on poor studies or studies done on statistically insignificant sample sizes (Walker claims that, based on a single study consisting of 3 subjects, that scientists can tell what people are dreaming from an MRI). This is rather an overstatement of the technology: https://www.wired.com/2014/04/brain-s...5.	Making stuff up.Since my last accusation is the most damning, let’s look at some specific examples. Walker writes: One way in which Mother Nature has perhaps helped adolescents unbuckle themselves from their parents is to march their circadian rhythms forward in time, past that of their adult mothers and fathers. This ingenious biological solution selectively shifts teenagers to a later phase when they can, for several hours, operate independently – and to do so as a peer-group collective.Got that? He’s saying that nature (i.e. evolution by natural selection) has provided a mechanism for the purpose of allowing teenagers to achieve independence from their parents by shifting their circadian rhythm such that they can stay up later and thereby operate independently from their parents, enabling them to interact with their peers. How, exactly, would this work from an evolutionary perspective? The shifted sleep cycle would have to confer some reproductive or survival advantage (teenagers find it easier to get-it-on, when the parents are asleep thereby outcompeting their peers?). What, exactly, is the proof in the fossil record of this assertion? Without putting too fine a point on it … this is a ‘Just-So’ story for which no evidence exists (nor could it possibly exist).Note: Some might claim his use of the word ‘perhaps’ provides an escape clause for the author. To this I would say: ‘perhaps’ you’re dreaming. Lest you think that was an isolated incident, here’s another … in a discussion of why cool temperatures are better for sleep Walker states:It is no evolutionary coincidence that we humans have developed the pre-bed ritual of splashing water on one of the most vascular parts of our bodies – our face, using one of the other highly vascular surfaces – our hands.So … splashing water on your face and hands before bed confers some evolutionary survival advantage?!? I can’t improve upon Mr. Simpson’s response in the Python sketch above … “You're mad!”Once an author fosters doubt in the reader as to the veracity of their claims, it throws the entirety of the work open to suspicion. This was the position in which I found myself in reading Why We Sleep. It soon became unclear whether I could trust anything Walker was saying. Although I’ve focused on the negative aspects, there is actually good information in the book (though most of it is pretty obvious). Unfortunately, the burden has been placed on the lay-reader to sort the wheat from the chaff when this responsibility lies solely with the author (an abrogation that I find difficult to forgive)."
60,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,5,"I wish this book had been around (and that I had read it) when I was young. It would have saved me lots of anguished and stressful learning through trial and error, experience, and experiment. I'm 60 years old and have struggled with insomnia my entire life; but I have always resisted prescription medications to alleviate my problem. This book has made me glad that I did. Rather than medicate myself, I have learned, through years of experience and experiment, to adopt nearly all of the 12 tips for healthy sleep that this book outlines:1.	Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.2.	Exercise is great – but not too late in the day.3.	Avoid caffeine and nicotine, especially before bedtime.4.	Avoid alcohol, especially before bedtime.5.	Avoid large meals and beverages late at night.6.	If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.7.	Don’t take naps after 3:00 p.m.8.	Relax before bed (e.g. reading or listening to music).9.	Take a hot bath before bed.10.	Dark bedroom, Cool bedroom, Gadget-free bedroom, Comfortable bed.11.	Have the right sunlight exposure (light in the morning, darkness in the evening).12.	Don’t lie in bed awake.So much valuable information is included in this book, including detailed descriptions of numerous tests and studies that have been conducted over the past several decades that prove decisively how important getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night – every night – is for each of us individually and for our families, our communities, and our society.
Within the space of a mere 100 years human beings have abandoned their biologically mandated need for adequate sleep – one that evolution spent 3.4 million years perfecting in service of life support functions. As a result, the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity, and the education of our children. This silent sleep loss epidemic is the greatest public health challenge we face in the 21st century in developed nations. If we wish to avoid the suffocating noose of sleep neglect, the premature death it inflicts, and the sickening health it invites, a radical shift in our personal, cultural, professional, and societal appreciation of sleep must occur. I believe it is time for us to reclaim our rights to a full night of sleep without embarrassment or the damaging stigma of laziness. In doing so, we can be reunited with that most powerful elixir of wellness and vitality, dispensed through every conceivable biological pathway. Then we may remember what it feels like to be truly awake during the day, infused with the very deepest plenitude of being.

61,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29403306-annelies,3,"Thank you NetGalley for the ARCThis is definitely an interesting book. It really made me consider my own sleeping habits and patterns. Some of the things Walker describes were very recognisable, like that change in your circadian rhythm in your teenage years where you have no problems staying up till late, but it's agony getting up in the morning to be in school by 8AM. I also liked the descriptions of all the research that has been done around sleep, it reminded me of my student years when I was a regular guinea pig for the psychology department.However...Walker is a bit of a doom-evangelist. If we don't get our 8 hours of sleep a day WE WILL DIE!! But not before we get Alzheimer's and diabetes and obesity and depression and low sperm count and lots of other nasty things. Look no further, sleep is the answer to all our problems. That's the general tone of the book, he uses the word 'catastrophe' regularly.Another problem with the tone of the book is that it's not quite clear who the intended audience is. At times Walker explains fairly simple things like how to pronounce 'thalamus' or a common phrase such as 'prevention versus treatment'. But then he also uses words like 'aerobic output', 'terra firma', 'epidermis' where 'skin' would have been fine, or 'in perpetuam' for perpetually.Then there were the not very funny jokes and abundant, annoying generalisations and assumptions about the general public.Like:-""You may have been expecting your general brainwave activity to be beautifully coherent and highly synchronous while awake,...""No, that's not my expectation at all. Mostly because I don't contemplate my brainwave activity very often, but also because I would rather expect my brainwaves to be all over the place while awake, considering the hectic nature of everyday live.-""Observe any post-lunch meeting around a boardroom table...""Yes, I have dozed of during meetings, but not necessarily after lunch. Of course the after-dinner-dip is a known phenomenon, but to take it for fact that every after lunch meeting is by definition a snore fest???So, overall, this book is worth reading. If you look past the cringy style and the endless descriptions of sleep experiments, you'll find a lot of interesting facts about sleep and enough food for thought about your own habits. "
62,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"Summary: You should sleep. A lot....at least seven hours a day. If you don't, your health may suffer in so many ways that thinking about it could keep you up at night.This is a good book on an important topic but it could have been much shorter. There was so much repetition that I felt the author was attempting to pad the book out to a predetermined length. He repeated the structure of his (and others) experiments so many times that I wished he had come up with some kind of short-hand; e.g., ""We then did a standard X-Y test with two groups of 25 adults each."" Several topics are repeated in different chapters, e.g. the effect of LED lights.On the plus side, he supports all of his claims with science-based studies and experiments and speaks with the authority of someone actually doing the work and not just reporting on it. Every time I was starting to get skeptical about some claim he would cite a study executed by himself or a colleague.One major omission: he says nothing about White Noise (now also referred to as pink, brown and blue noise). There have been studies that support the benefits of white noise in aiding effective sleep. I for one have benefitted immensely from white noise, especially during the 8 years I lived in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and every time I travel and stay in motels or hotels. And I still benefit at home from mild white noise from a humidifier in our bedroom. (My wife benefits when I snore.)Despite these minor criticisms I do recommend this book, especially for anyone suffering from inadequate quantity or quality of sleep."

A life-changing book. The author does a stellar job at illustrating the function and importance of sleep in our daily lives and in nature as a whole. What's even more impressive - he manages to tell a fascinating story AND back it up with solid research. What I took away from this book:- How sleep works - melatonin, the circadian rhythm and sleep pressure- Dreams help us maintain our emotional equilibrium- Sleep has major impact on our mental and physical wellbeing, the lack of it being one of the underlying causes of severe illnesses- Sleep facilitates the learning process- Easy steps anyone can follow to get better sleep:1) Create a routine - go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Don't use an alarm.2) No screens 2 hours before going to bed.3) Exercise, but not right before bed.4) Try to sleep in a slightly chilly room.5) Regulate light - only soft and warm yellow light after dark, complete darkness during sleep.6) No alcohol or sleeping pills, no coffee after noon.Many will probably say that ""well, I know all of these already"", which was partially true for me too. But here is where the book excels - it makes you not only know, but understand and really implement these ""easy things"".To quote and thank Liina for suggesting this amazing book - ""sleep is my religion now"""

The book is not far from pseudoscience.Just in the first chapter (10 pages long) of Why We Sleep, Walker:1. completely misrepresents the relationship between sleep and longevity and between sleep and cancer2. erroneously states that getting a good night’s sleep is always beneficial3. erroneously states that patients with fatal familial insomnia die because of lack of sleep4.. seems to invent a “fact” that the WHO has declared a “sleep loss epidemic”5. misrepresents National Sleep Foundation’s sleep recommendations and uses them to misrepresent the number of adults failing to get the recommended hours of sleep (Section 5)5.1. also seems to invent the WHO’s sleep recommendations6. calls his book “a scientifically accurate intervention”"

You didn't think you needed a book about sleep, but I could have used another several chapters. At the end, he gives some sleep advice--nothing new, but useful nonetheless. Avoid artificial light, no sleeping pills (he feels very strongly about this), no alcohol, get up and do something else if you can't fall asleep and wake up at a natural time. Not with an alarm clock. He seems like he's not that fun of a guy to hang out with, but I bet he has amazing REM sleep"

68,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,4,"Pretty sleep-frantic experience reading this book. Especially since I read some chapters in the middle of the night, where I couldn't fall back asleep. Reading this in a state riddled with insomnia-induced anxiety, the interpretation was: You're going to die if you don't fall asleep right about now. This aside, what a wonderful compilation of sleep research. The studies mentioned in this book make it clear to me that cutting sleep short to wake up and work on something is a nonsensical treadmill, since you'll just remember less of what you did yesterday. The study referenced I found most terrifying is that just a night of drinking (to around the legal limit for driving) can reduce what you retain on that day by 40-50%. Even worse, if you learn something on Wednesday and drink on Friday, there's still two digit percentage amnesia. I found this mind-boggling. Overall, book clinched that if you say that you're fine on 5-6 hours of sleep you're an idiot (or, in life circumstances that makes it hard to do something different—but, hopefully not under the illusion that it's fine). You don't have a 'gene.' And you can't ""catch up with sleep."" If you spend your day learning, not sleeping is like closing Word without saving.Why not 5 stars? I feel that he could've dispelled or confirmed more of the sleep zeitgeist such as magnesium supplements, marijuana, and others. The book could be a lot more prescriptive. Yes, Mr. Walker, you make it pretty clear that jet lag is just about the worst thing you can do to your body. But how do you recommend combatting it? What's your secret sleep sauce? No dice. The book reminds me of the early popular books on gut bacteria where it seems like the solution we've been looking for all along to ADHD, Alzheimer's, and other diseases. Walker could be a bit more nuanced, because he's claiming basically the same, for the same diseases. I mean, maybe he's right, I'm not a doctor—but this type of argument triggers my bullshit alarm bells. That said, this is a read well-worth your time—but this doesn't quite obtain the Bible-status in the sleep genre to me."

Forget the sleeping pills, open the book, read a few pages, and hey presto you’re snoring.Okay, I’m a bit unfair here. Dr Walker has spent a lifetime of sleep research and presents many interesting and important facts. For example, lack of sleep makes your testicles shrink; or, if you go a night without sleep you won’t be able to concentrate so well the next day.Okay, I’m still being unfair. Fascinating anecdotes pepper the book all the way through, and I did eventually managed to finish it. The problem is that it often reads like a professor’s thesis, and desperately needs editing so idiots like me can follow the gobbledegook. Put another way: if Dr Walker presented his findings only, and cut out the boring details of how he found them, he could reduce this 369-page manuscript to a thick pamphlet—and much better for it."

73,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70820167-sebastian-roa,2,"All I gained from reading this is anxiety about not sleeping enough. It puts in your head that if you miss as little as one hour of sleep you risk getting all major problems including Cancer and Alzheimer, you might get fat, depressed and it might even ruin your DNA. It gives you no hope whatsoever, just a series of repetitive descriptions of experiments that go like this: We took X amount of healthy young people (or mice), we sleep deprevided half of them, tried for Y effect and surprisingly the deprived confirmed that sleeping deprivation causes or increases chances of getting Z problem. This description is given over and over, you start to believe it and say Jesus! how am I not dead already?, then the obsession begins, you buy a fitbit, you track your sleep hours and get frustrated when you can’t get what is deemed to be the minimum sleep time, before you know it you’re waking up in the middle of the night unable to sleep because of the anxiety not sleeping enough creates.If the desired effect was to scare people of missing sleep, one chapter would’ve sufficed, I also got bored of it trying to convince me of what it already convinced me a few chapters ago, missing sleep is bad, you keep hoping the book is going to give you some help for the problem it says you had but it just doesn’t.It’s a shame because there’s some genuinely interesting bits here but not enough for a whole book and all of the doom chapters don’t help.You can summarise with the general adivise: don’t sacrifice sleep when weighted against something else and try to get as much of it as you can without over thinking it."

75,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,4,"This was a very important and interesting book for me to read. We all know that sleeping is important, but sometimes it is good to remember how critical it is and why. I was never so great at sleeping, but after reading this I am trying to remind myself every night, how important it is to sleep (and what happens in the lack of this important activity).The book covers so much, from the biological clock, to our functioning with and without sleep, and the sleep hormone. He also explains our 24 hours biological clock, and the brain functioning in sleep vs being awake.Long distanceDifferent atomREM sleep is very important for humans. And the brains functions differently during this time, and need sleep time to get to this stage. One theory I have offered is that the uneven back-and-forth interplay between NREM and REM sleep is necessary to elegantly remodel and update our neural circuits at night, and in doing so manage the finite storage space within the brain. Forced by the known storage capacity imposed by a set number of neurons and connections within their memory structures, our brains must find the “sweet spot” between retention of old information and leaving sufficient room for the new. Balancing this storage equation requires identifying which memories are fresh and salient, and which memories that currently exist are overlapping, redundant, or simply no longer relevant.And in addition, REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep. It is often impossible to distinguish REM sleep from wakefulness using just electrical brainwave activity.It is even more clear that it is important since 30% of the brain more active in REM sleep than awake. Indeed, recent MRI scanning studies have found that there are individual parts of the brain that are up to 30 percent more active during REM sleep than when we are awake!I loved the part that he talked about teenagers and their need for sleep. Teenagers (before midlife and old age) need more sleep but in a different time than their parents. We try to force them to sleep at specific time and they are actually not easily adjusted to these times. I once saw from a large insurance firm, which read: “Why do most 16-year-olds drive like they’re missing part of their brain? Because they are.” It takes deep sleep, and developmental time, to accomplish the neural maturation that plugs this brain “gap” within the frontal lobe. When your children finally reach their mid-twenties and your car insurance premium drops, you can thank sleep for the savings.He also mentions drunk drivers and sleep deprived drivers. The latter are at least as risky as the former, and are even more common. There is a way to test this and prove that someone was sleep deprived.4 solid stars. Don't miss your sleep time, and read this book."
76,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,2,"Mediocre book. I’ve been interested in reading about sleep ever since I did a paper on the topic during my senior year in high school. This book ended up being uninteresting except for the mechanics of sleep and the dream chapters. Disclaimer, I’m writing this review while sleep deprived. The book is well organized, which may be its best virtue. Easy to browse. The writing is preachy. The author is a sleep zealot, and it just got on my nerves from nearly the beginning of the book. The content of the book was also weak. The mechanics of sleep and the dreaming sections were interesting, but couldn’t make up for the flaws of the other sections. Basically, the author only used his successful research, cherry picking as it were. Other studies were mentioned in passing and only if the research supported his conclusions. The attitude of lack of sleep causing everything from diabetes to cancer also seemed a bit far fetched and the tone was puritanical. The causes of sleeplessness and the diseases and solutions were conventional, nothing I hadn’t read before. In short, I ended up being very disappointed with this book.  So, I give this a 2. It’s interesting in parts, but author credibility and tone killed the book for me. Might be a good introduction to sleep and sleep issues if you don’t know about the topic and enjoyed being lectured at.  "
77,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7310558-liina-bachmann,5,"People who sleep too little (less than 8 hours a night more or less regularly) are stupid, can't remember stuff, have a weak immune system, die younger, are a burden to the health care system and a threat to other people. Sufficient sleep is the single most important thing you can do for your health and well being but still the ""5hour sleep"" is glorified, justified and not reacted upon. Well read the book and you won't think it okay to sleep little even if you ""feel okay"" the next day. Yes you can function on little sleep but do you wanna wade through your life making decisions like a cognitively impaired person does? Not to mention that your body is in a constant stress state when you don't rest well. The paradox is that high level responsibility jobs often go hand in hand with little time to sleep. Meaning the decisions made are done so in a state where one's judgement is not sound. You don't even want to start thinking about the long shifts that doctors do and how it affects their job - a subject that has a separate chapter in the book. I do hope that there will be a shift in the prevailing attitude about sleep hygiene and in decades to come we will frown upon sleeping too little, the same way we look at smoking while pregnant for example, that was tolerated just fine not very long ago."
78,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13448706-prashanthini-mande,5,"We all need 8 hours of sleep. Most of us know this fact but still sacrifice sleep because we do not know the extent of damage lack of sleep can do. Some of us think that they can fully function on 4-6 hours of sleep. A few of us may also think sleeping is for losers. We can sleep when we die. To all of us, I would say, please read this book.The sheer number of problems we face because of lack of sleep is scary. Sleep affects everything - our mental ability, interpersonal relationships, physical health, sanity, careers, and much, much more. Sleep is more important than food and exercise. The author is a sleep scientist. He explains the experiments conducted behind every sleep-related discovery he lays down. Though I have corrected my sleep pattern since I started reading this book, part of me is still a bit skeptic. “Of course the sleep scientist wants to make everything about sleep”, is the thought. That’s why I told my scientist friend to read this book and tell me how foolproof his experiments are. I’m just waiting for her advice before I start telling everybody I meet to sleep better. "
79,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,5,"[30 November 2018]This is a book that I believe every adult should read, at least every adult in the developed world, where we treat sleep as barely necessary. One of my friends called this book frightening, and it is. Mostly we are unaware of the absolute necessity of sleep and the very dangerous effect of ignoring it. It affects all parts of our lives, our physical health, our emotional health, and our cognitive health and we stint on sleep to our immediate, and maybe permanent peril. Generally I tend to take dire warning books like this with something of a grain of salt. Such sensationalism is often exaggerated in order to attract readers. But Walker is a serious sleep researcher and teacher. He writes very well and seems to earnestly care about educating the public. And his claims are solidly backed up with evidence based not just on his own research but that of many other serious sleep specialists. It's a good read and I strongly recommend it."
80,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,5,"I stumbled upon this book when Thom Yorke's last album (ANIMA) came out. There was an interview he begins by mentioning being obsessed with this book. Because of how I discovered it, as well as the title, I was expecting something a bit more focussed on dreaming, but what I got was exactly what I needed...Sleep and I have had a tenuous relationship for most of my life. Until about 10 years ago or so, I'd say I resented having a need for sleep (how much more reading and everything one could do were there no need for sleep?!!). Through most of high school and my 20s, I probably slept an average of 4 to 6 hours of sleep per night. I was quite fond of staying up late (2-ish) and getting up early (6-ish). It was not uncommon for me to fall asleep in class even when excited and highly engaged. Around age 20 or 21, I fell asleep while driving on the highway late at night. One minute, I was awake, the next I awoke to my car drifting into the guardrail. It is only by sheer luck/divine intervention that I'm not dead (much less even injured) and that I did not hurt anyone else. Needless to say, I've been much more careful about not driving when I'm tired or pulling over if I do get tired. Aging has slowly demanded more sleep and I've come to look forward to sleeping, but I'm still probably averaging about 5 to 7 hours, when 7 to 9 is probably what I need.Similar to medical students' syndrome, it was hard for me to read this book and not see myself in every warning and description. I was picturing my head filled with fraying telomeres! But hypochondria and paranoia aside, Walker not only passionately reveals the power and benefits of sleep, he lays down a clarion call for our species and the industrialized world. Sleep plays such a crucial role for existence that he partially wonders why we ever awakened:
Many of the explanations for why we sleep circle around a common, and perhaps erroneous, idea: sleep is the state we must enter in order to fix that which has been upset by wake. But what if we turned this argument on its head? What if sleep is so useful---so physiologically beneficial to every aspect of our being---that the real question is: Why did life ever bother to wake up? Considering how biologically damaging the state of wakefulness can often be, that is the true evolutionary puzzle here, not sleep. Adopt this perspective, and we can pose a very different theory: sleep was the first state of life on this planet, and it from sleep that wakefulness emerged. It may be a preposterous hypothesis, and one that nobody is taking seriously or exploring, but personally I do not think it to be entirely unreasonable.
Even small amounts of lost sleep can have a huge impact--he underscores this by pointing to the significant uptick in strokes and traffic incidents the day daylight savings is implemented, as well as the downtick in such incidents the day we end daylight savings. That's just one potential hour of sleep lost. Still think it's no big deal? Walker reminds us that the Guinness Book of Records has eliminated all records/categories related to prolonged wakefulness, the World Health Organization has officially classified nightshift work as a ""probable carcinogen,"" and sleep deprivation is often used as a form of torture. And here you thought this book was going to be a snoozer!Lest you think this book is all doom and gloom, Walker writes with good pace, a sense of humor, and a wonderful balance between citing research and offering memorable anecdotes and takeaways (like the fact that the guy who set up the ridiculous sleepless schedule medical residents often endure happened to achieve those same hours via a little help from a cocaine addiction). Sleep has so many wonderful benefits that it is mind boggling to consider the extent society is designed to thwart it (from our devices' screens and their blue light emissions, which delay the release of melatonin, to our school and work schedules which erode the very productivity and efficiency they aim to achieve). A great deal of memory retainment, cleanup, and processing goes on while we sleep. It's why almost every culture has a phrase for ""sleep on it"" when stumped by a problem. Our dreams and sleeping mind make connections and look at the big picture in a way we can't easily access while awake. If it sounds like I've drunk the kool aid when it comes to this book, that's attributable to Walker (and way too many side effects, limitations, and frustrations I've experienced personally). For those who have genuine trouble sleeping (as opposed to being stubborn and idiotic like myself), Walker offers a number of suggestions and resources for seeking help (spoiler: none of them involve sleeping pills). As you may have surmised, it's hard for me to review this book without wanting to retell the whole book to you. It feels that essential. As opposed to blathering on, I'll leave you with some factoids and points of interest...Lack of sleep may cause:- Memory issues- Decreased motor skills- Trouble concentrating- Physical and chemical damage to the body- Increased chance of stroke, diabetes, weight issues, cancer- Decreased testicle size and lowered testosterone in males- Potential fertility issues in females- Irritability- Less productivity- Less creativity- Increased propensity to lie/deceive- Decrease in attractivenessOther random stuff you might want to know:- Teenagers are not only wired to need more sleep but their rhythms run on a different cycle (i.e., a teenager's circadian rhythms will have them wanting to go to bed and wake up about 2 to 3 hours later than an adult)- Industrialized countries may be losing up to 2 to 3% GDP from lost productivity due to workers not sleeping enough- 10 nights of 6 hrs of sleep each is roughly equivalent to going without sleep for a full 24 hours in terms of impairment- ""After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.""- Dreams may act as a type of therapy by retaining memories but decoupling them from the negative emotions an event incurred- Reading on an iPad may delay melatonin release up to 50% (approximately a 3 hour delay) compared to reading a printed book at night - Researchers are starting to be able to predict, as well as direct dreams to a certain extentSleep resources:- National Sleep Foundation- NIH Healthy Sleep Site- 12 Simple Tips to Improve Your SleepSweet dreams!"
81,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5,"This was really good, I think everyone should read it, and it completely stressed me out. There was so much good information on the importance of getting enough sleep, supported by study after study, and hey, I’m on board! But my stupid body isn’t as keen. There’s a lot more in here about all the bad things that result from sleep deprivation than there is about how to fix it when you have insomnia (which are two different things, I learned, both with sucky results. I believe I probably have maintenance insomnia—nothing like self-diagnosing!), and that’s what stressed me out while I was reading it. I’d go to bed, planning a “sleep opportunity” of 8 hours, and a couple hours later my body would say, “Nope.” And then I’d say, “Come on, self. There’s a lot riding on this. Do it.” And then I would worry about it. And do bad-for-sleep things like pull out my tablet and watch El Camino at 4:00 in the morning. Jesse Pinkman, though. I do feel better informed, but also worried. There are a lot of societal changes regarding sleep that would improve people’s health, but they’re so big: things like later school start times, less insane sleep schedules for medical residents, hospitals dialing back the lights and alarms so patients can actually sleep. All great ideas. I don’t know how we make them happen. But I will say, this is one of those rare books that has changed my behavior and mindset in what I think will be a lasting way. And it did have some sleeping advice that I’ve followed and other things I still need to try. As I read this, I thought about the people in my life who are sleep deprived or maybe have a sleep disorder, and the health problems they have that are probably related to it. I really do think everyone should read this, and I’ll be recommending it a lot.One last thing: this guy is very readable, but he wasn’t exactly writing for laughs. This quote did make me laugh, though, given the effect the book was having on me.  When communicating science to the general public in lectures or writing, I’m always wary of bombarding an audience with never-ending mortality and morbidity statistics, lest they themselves lose the will to live in front of me."
82,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,5,"I very rarely borrow books from friends. For some reason, I have a highly irrational fear that I'll never give them their book back, plus I own so many unread books already, it doesn't make much sense to add to the ever growing tbr list. But when a friend brought up having just finished this book, and I blurted out a rushed request to borrow the book and got ready to beg for it if necessary. I had to read this book, immediately.I don't even know where to start this review. In many ways, it's an utterly terrifying read. You've heard it (and ignored it) a million times before; proper sleep is the best thing you can do for your health. But Matthew Walker, a neurologist and sleep researcher, sets out to explain exactly why. So much of this book just makes so much sense. Scarily so. I have lived this. You have lived this. We all have. Even if ""lack of sleep"" isn't recorded as the cause of death on your death certificate, it's highly likely it contributed to whatever is. It's incredible we have ignored how damaging sleep deprivation is to both individuals and society as a whole. I don't know how anyone could argue with any of Walker's conclusions he has made here in this highly detailed but accessible exploration of all aspects of sleep.A lot of the insights into sleep hygiene were not news to me. I have a fatigue and sleep related chronic illness, and I am well versed in proper sleep hygiene, because it is one of the only methods I've been able to find that makes a genuine difference to my quality of life. I've always believed this is not unique to me, and that we could all vastly improve our quality of lives if we paid more attention to our sleep. It's just if I get it wrong and let stop paying enough attention, the consequences are a little more....obvious. And immediate. But really the consequences are there for everybody and Walker does a fantastic job in explaining the long term and deadly consequences of cheating yourself from proper sleep. If you are the kind of person who boasts about not needing sleep and sleep being a waste of time, then read this book! Yes, you may be able to just about function in the short term, but it really isn't worth it.Perhaps the scariest part of the book for me, personally, was how much of sleep is still a mystery and how little science has progressed in this area over the years. One possible explanation for this, as Walker demonstrates, is that the Big Pharma industry just doesn't consider sleep science to be a profitable endeavour and, therefore, has no interest it. The money and consequently the faster paced research is more likely to be directed into more profitable areas. This lack of interest in the medical research community has real-world consequences for many, but especially those who are left to deal with a poorly understood sleeping disorder. Walker underlines this by using the case of narcolepsy as an example:
Overall, the treatment outlook for narcoleptic patients is bleak at present, and there is no cure in sight. Much of the treatment fate of narcolepsy sufferers and their families resides in the slower-progressing hands of academic research, rather than the more rapid progression of big pharmaceutical companies. For now, patients simply must try to manage life with the disorder, living as best they can.
As someone with a poorly understood chronic illness, this is terrifying. As a side note, it was actually this section on narcolepsy that caused my friend to recommend me the book, because it reminded him of my situation, and in fact many (lay) people ask if I have is narcolepsy and I often struggle to remember why it isn't, but reading this whole section spelled out to me again how different the conditions are. Walker really did a fantastic job at writing this overview of narcolepsy, and I think most readers will be surprised at the misconceptions they have of the condition. Although I clearly don't have narcolepsy, my condition also has a definite lack of proper treatment and there is limited understanding of the exact causes, and this chapter with examples of sleeping disorders really struck me for that reason. I can deeply sympathise with anyone who has misunderstood disorder, sleeping or otherwise, and it's frustrating to think it might be many, many years before things improve for these people. But that's the nature of being human, and it is only with such huge developments in science and medicine that we've come to misplaced conclusion that everything is ""curable"".Even if some of the book's many conclusions are scary, that's not to say I didn't smile at all reading this. Sleep really is incredible! When you start to learn how it works, you realise that something we consider so mudane is really a biological marvel, and there were so much mind-blowing information to process in this book. From the different functions and composition of the different stages of sleep (NREM and REM), how sleep is vital in forming memories and learning new skills, how different people and different age groups really do have different sleep requirements, to how varied sleep looks between the species and the fact that some species don't have the same sleep stages as we do. Ever thought about how an animal sleeping in a tree can not enter paralysed REM or dreaming sleep for risk of falling? Me neither, but it was fascinating to learn that sleeping on the ground (with the help of fire for safety) enabled us to REM sleep and for our brains to develop creatively. Perhaps my favourite little factual nugget from the book was that some animals, such as birds or dolphins, are able to have half their brain sleep at a time. Yes, that really means that half of the brain is asleep, while the other half is awake! Sadly, Walker makes it absolutely clear in this chapter that, no, humans can definitely not do this. So we lost the evolutionary jackpot there. I could go on and on about how much this book taught me, but really there would be little point in that, because I'm sure you'll be reading the book yourself!I really can't say anything against this book, an easy 5 stars. Tons of fascinating information presented in a readable and accessible way. It's really a triumph that Walker was able to illuminate some of the very edges of scientific knowledge for us lay people. All I can say is if you are a human being that sleeps (yes, that means you) then you need to read this book yesterday."
83,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6059871-vicky-chijwani,5,"I have a weird relationship with sleep, as many of my friends can attest to. I tend to sleep like a brick for 8+ hours, but getting into said brick-like state is difficult thanks to my restless mind. I've pulled all-nighters before nearly all of my undergraduate exams, collapsing into unconsciousness right after, then waking up and diving straight into cramming for the next one. I have once even gone 48+ hours without sleep (NB: would not recommend). At one point these may have seemed like necessary, even heroic, feats. But this book showed me just how stupid I was.Over the past year or so I've started to come around to the view of the sensible folks like my dad: having a sane sleep schedule is critical to productivity and health, both physical and mental. And so this book comes at a critical juncture for me: I hope its lessons push me over firmly to the other side.My notes:Sleep-wake cycle- The sleep-wake cycle is controlled by 2 processes, known as Process C (24-hour circadian rhythm controlled by light and melatonin) and Process S (sleep pressure caused by continuous accumulation of the neurotransmitter adenosine).- Sleep “debt” - the feeling that you need more sleep, even long after waking up - is a result of leftover adenosine that wasn't cleared away because of a lack of sleep.Chronotypes- Distribution of larks (early risers) vs. owls (late risers) in the general populace = 40% vs 30%. Rest lie in between.- Your owlness / larkness is strongly determined by genetics.- Evolutionary reasons for chronotype variation: more safety in tribes due to staggered sleep timesCaffeine- Caffeine works by blocking sites on nerve endings where the neurotransmitter adenosine normally accumulates to induce drowsiness.- Caffeine's half-life in healthy adults is 3-7 hours.- Some winners of a genetic lottery produce a much more efficient version of the liver enzyme that removes caffeine from the body.Stages of sleep- There are 2 “kinds” of sleep - REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-REM, duh). Both perform critical brain functions.- Through the night we experience 1.5-hour cycles of wakefulness -> light NREM -> deep NREM -> REM -> wakefulness.- The natural sleep cycle of ancient humans was biphasic - a long sleep at night and a short nap in the midafternoon. Contrary to popular myth, the medieval European practice of 2 long bouts of sleep at night with an intervening wake period of a few hours was not natural. It was a cultural phenomenon.Sleep debt and deprivation- NREM sleep dominates during the early half of the night, REM sleep towards the end. We get most (60-90%) of our REM sleep in the last 25% of time. So it's critical not to cut your sleep short in the early morning.- Similarly, going to bed later than your circadian rhythm demands, results in an NREM debt.- If deprived of both kinds of sleep, your body will first repay the NREM debt, and on the following nights, the REM debt.- 6 hours of sleep for 10 nights is demonstrably as bad as being awake for 24 hours straight - 4x increase in “microsleeps” where the brain instantaneously sleeps and then becomes alert again, often without the individual even realizing.- Effects of less than 6 hours sleep:** 10-30% less time to physical exhaustion** Similarly reduced limb extension force and vertical jump height** Reduced peak and sustained muscle strength** Impaired cardiovascular and metabolic capability, including faster lactic acid buildup, reduction in blood oxygen saturationRelation between age and sleep- Newborns spend most of their time sleeping- Infants have a weak circadian rhythm - that's why they awaken and sleep at odd hours - Young children need more sleep than adults, 10 hours or so. Their circadian rhythms run a little earlier as well.- Teenagers' circadian rhythms are moved forward compared to adults - the urge to sleep comes later, as does awakening. Early school start times therefore rob teenagers of REM sleep.- In the elderly, sleep is more fragmented - they don't sleep as deeply and wake up more often, as a consequence of degradation of brain regions that generate sleep. Side note: nighttime bathroom falls and fractures are quite common and significantly hasten end of life in older adults.NREM sleep- Stores memories: moving them from the hippocampus to the cortex for long-term storage** This occurs via “sleep spindles” - short, powerful bursts of electrical activity every 100-200 milliseconds during stage 2 NREM sleep** More spindles = better retention** Spindle activity is richest in the last 2 hours of 8-hour sleep (during stage 2 NREM)- Removes unnecessary neural connections- Experimental demonstrations:** 20% increase in next-day memory retention vs. when the same people are sleep-deprived** 20% increase in task speed and 35% increase in accuracy of newly-learned motor skills next dayREM sleep & dreaming- REM sleep forms associations between distant ideas in memory, contributing to creativity and offering solutions to complex problems after a night of “sleeping on it”.- Dreaming dissociates events from their emotional impact, so mental pain / anguish fades over time even though the event is still easily remembered. Also the brain can extract learning for the future without being hit by emotion every time the lesson is recalled.- Experimental demonstrations:** 60% of participants were able to come up with a creative solution (already known to the experimenters) for a mundane task after a full sleep, vs 20% of those who attempted the same task after 8 hours awake in the daytime, even though they were free to ponder the problem consciously.** Depression patients dreaming of painful memories were able to get past them, while those not dreaming of the memories continued to struggle a year later** In PTSD patients, the brain cannot enter dreaming state due to high levels of noradrenaline (stress inducer). If the brain cannot divorce emotion from memory, it will try again the next night - this explains recurring nightmares in PTSD patients. Noradrenaline suppressors are shown to help."

85,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"I have to admit, before reading this book, my treatment of sleeping was guided by the principle ""I will sleep when I die"". Not realizing that that kind of attitude, ironically, brings closer the moment we will drift off to that kind of sleep. It is easy to be misguided and curtail a seemingly useless human biological process as sleeping when there's so much to achieve, see, books to read, and things to do. Not a second to waste on this useless activity as sleeping. Sleep shouldn't be in a way of all the good things a short life offers. Stop. Think it over. Sleep is actually one of the best things you have. Just accept it, this is how the Nature wanted it to be. And she wants a proper share of your inactive hours each day.According to ASA – American Sleep Association, about 20% of the US population have a sleeping disorder. That crazy number confirms how many of us mistreat such an important thing as sleep. The statistic of all the troubles sleep deprivation brings along is brutal. This book aims to be an eye opener about the problem and it has a very important message.The author provides many arguments and good research why sleep is important. The psychology and biology of the sleeping process is covered. There is some guidance and tips of how to improve your sleeping, but that is not the main theme of the book. There a numerous other good sources about how to improve your sleep, like ASA. Some parts of the book made me literary fall asleep which was actually approved by the author, and I am not sure whether he put those somehow less interesting sections in the book intentionally. Nevertheless, it is an important book to read for realization that a good sleep must become a bedrock of a healthy body."
86,Los,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Matthew P. Walker, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, informs readers why sleep is the pillar of our healthy existence, the foundation without which diet and exercise alone can't keep us healthy. In Why We Sleep, he answers questions such as what is sleep, the types of sleep and what do they do to your brain, various sleep disorders and how they damage your health, what's the function of dreams, what do alcohol and caffeine do to your brain, etc.. I find the book very informative. I am especially fascinated by the chapters about dreams (hint: none of your Freudian analysis). Why We Sleep is also a disturbing read: The modern world is really not a friendly place for human beings when it comes to sleep: early school start time damages our kids; inhuman hours in professional medical training; unhealthy work culture, and a lot more. Do you know the ""sleep"" induced by sleeping pills, a multi-billion dollar business, is not the real, constructive sleep you'd expect from Mother Nature, and sleep deprivation in kids can masquerade as ADHD? And you really shouldn't rely on alcohol to fall sleep. Ok, now I must do something about my poor sleep quality."

This book dives deep into all aspects of sleep: the whys, hows, whens, and so much more. It made me re-evaluate the way I sleep and confront myself about how it is actually affecting (and affected!) my day to day life. It shows how our physical, mental, intellectual problems can be partly traced back to the way we incorrectly sleep. (I know).The author has a really special way of unraveling complicated scientific processes and pathways into bite-sized, interesting bits of information you can actually remember even after finishing reading the book. He also offers some advice on hygienic sleeping, dispels many myths, and explains some of the common sleep disorders we are plagued by. Do read this if you're interested in sleep, you won't be disappointed!"
