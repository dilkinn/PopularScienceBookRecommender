Zimmer is getting to be one of my very favorite science writers. If you have any interest in cetaceans, you should read this book. Highly recommended. Here's a bit I loved:""The seeds of a more surprising redemption of some of Haeckel's ideas came from the work of a mathematician named Alan Turing. Scientists who live on the harsh, lifeless plains of the physical sciences sometimes look at biology as a vacation spot - a lush green island they can visit, make a few groundbreaking discoveries, then head back to the quantum steppes. After all, they say to themselves, if you know the laws of electrons and protons, if you can solve differential equations, you already know how Life works. Most of these scientists barely get off the plane before they discover that they were wrong - that biology's island paradise is a sweet-smelling swamp - and they either sink out of sight or catch the next flight out. But a few, such as Alan Turing, have managed to discover some original biological principles."""

2,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965510-chris,5,"Some chapters in this book read easily and others require some persistence to get through the technical information. But what a fascinating story. Zimmer uses the evolution from aquatic animals to land animals and then the evolution back to the water (whales) to explain macroevolution - and the process by which scientists learn about it. He's a very good writer and a great guide through what might seem rather esoteric stuff.I enjoyed talking with people about this book though I learned from several that though us biologists think of the basics of evolution as being common knowledge, they are not. Anyone with an interest in evolutionary biology will enjoy this. Zimmer has a blog where he updates people on what has happened since he wrote this book."
3,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,5,"_At the Water's Edge_ by Carl Zimmer is a fascinating and well-written account of macroevolution, evolution outside of the ""generation-by-generation"" pace of microevolution. In microevolution, biologists can follow the process of natural selection; as every generation of a species produces a line of variants, some of these variants do better than others and survive to possibly pass on those variant traits to their offspring. Biologists can for instance track the success (and failure) of individual genes or how a particular species of insect adapts to a new pesticide. Macroevolution on the other hand works on much larger, grander scales, a scale in which completely new types of bodies appear.Zimmer sought to examine macroevolution in the development of tetrapods from fish (which occurred between 380 and 360 million years ago) and whales from land mammals (occurring about 50 million years ago), using these fascinating accounts to introduce to the reader two of the most common features of macroevolution - exaptations of existing features and the correlated progression of many different parts.Exaptation is a term used to describe the notion of a structure crafted by evolution for one function and later becoming ideal for another, often completely different function. Early in the 20th century this concept was known as preadaptation, a term coined by Alfred Sherwood Romer, though Stephen Jay Gould and Elizabeth Vrba in 1982 offered the term exaptation instead as preadaptation seemed to imply some sort of conscious planning for the future that evolution can never have.In tetrapod evolution, the production of urea in lobe-fins was an exaptation - originally evolved as a way for an organism to avoid ammonia poisoning, excess salt, and water loss at sea, an excellent system for when tetrapods came ashore. Lungs may have evolved originally not for life on land but to give predatory fish more stamina in chasing prey at sea, this ability helping keep the heart nourished and allowing the fish to swim longer and harder than fish without lungs. Early tetrapods evolved legs to move along shallow, coastal lagoon bottoms and through flooded forests, not to move onto land, an ""exaptation of the most dramatic sort."" Among whales, _Ambulocetus_, an ancestor with perhaps a crocodile-like lifestyle, may have evolved the ability to hold its breath while it drowned its prey in deep water, an exaptation for later life at sea. Similarly, the ability of _Ambulocetus_ to hear low-frequency sounds traveling through the ground - as it rested its head on the shore, waiting for prey, the sounds traveling up its bony jaw - may have been an exaptation for hearing underwater.Correlated progression is a bit harder of a concept to explain. Essentially, it is a ""choreography of changes"" in an animal. The term, originated by Keith Thomson in the 1960s, describes how one change in a particular aspect of an organism cannot take place unless natural selection was also altering the other parts of the organism for other adaptations at the same time; changes in one part of the body can sometimes make other changes more beneficial to an animal. If anatomical features of an animal are tightly linked together, they will change in concert.The evolution of the tetrapod ear is an excellent example of correlated progression. The stapes in the human ear is homologous with a large bone that supports fish jaws, known as the hyomandibular. The ancestral lobe-fin fish's skull was originally a loose collection of bones held together by ligaments, the hyomandibular serving to brace the upper and lower jawbones against the back of the braincase and also helping to flare open the gill flap to let stale water out of the animal's head. As shown by such fossils as _Acanthostega_, early tetrapods developed a braincase that was fused shut, the jaw being able now to make direct contact with the sturdier skull, the hyomandibular bone no longer needed to support the jaw (and also not needed for working the gills as they became less important for breathing). The hyomandibular shrank and became lodged tightly in the back of the skull, at first locked in so much that it couldn't vibrate freely. Later on other bones of the skull became sturdy enough that the proto-stapes could loosen and begin transmitting sounds to the brain. The stapes could only evolve as a new type of bite was evolving thanks to changes in the skull and in breathing. In turn, the shrinking hyomandibular had its own effects; as the muscles that once connected it to the gill arches now were attached to the jaw to open and shut it and support the head on its shoulders, the dwindling hyomandibular let other bones and muscles create the tetrapod neck. Also, when the shoulders were liberated from the head and from the heavy bone once covering the gills, there was enough room for a bigger, more complex shoulder joint better suited to walking on land.Similarly, the evolution of whale echolocation was a good example of correlated progression, each incremental change in the head of the whale encouraging other changes. Some whales may have accidentally made noises in their nose that, thanks to their echoes, made it easier to hunt prey. Sound may have inadvertently been focused by nose plugs, with whales with oversized nose plugs being favored (the nose plugs evolving into melons). The nose moved up towards the top of the head for easier breathing, but the jaws expanded back to carry it there, which made the whale's skull more stable as it moved back and creating a reflecting dish on the upper jaw for sounds waves coming from the nose as a well as a platform on which the melon to rest.In addition to being a book on the concepts of exaptation and correlated progression, the book can simply be read as an excellent illustrated report of the evolution of tetrapods and whales, with the history of research, accounts of the personalities involved, and speculations on the lifestyles and habitats of early tetrapods and whales."
4,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"Carl Zimmer is one of my favorite authors. He brings a freshness and clarity to evolutionary biology. Each time I pick up a general interest science book like this, I think this ground has already been covered by my other reading, but there's always something new to learn from a different approach. If there was some concept in a Darwin, Dawkins, Prothero, Coyne, etc., book that I didn't grasp, Zimmer clears it up. Microevolution versus macroevolution. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. What the scientific atmosphere was in Darwin's time and how what we've learned since then ties in with Darwin's theories -- and what other theories have been abandoned and why. How we organize and categorize past and present organisms and figure out their relationships using the incomplete and often conflicting data of fossils, morphology, cladistics, embryology, and molecular phylogeny. It's complicated, but Zimmer's storytelling keeps it interesting."
5,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6801719-catherine,4,An elegant book that has helped me to understand how macroevolution happens. Fun facts: A blue whale's tongue weighs as much as an elephant. Hippos once climbed the Alps.
6,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,3,"Odd mix. The beginning is very beginner-oriented but it also goes deep into some genetic science that was a bit dense for me, and it also has a strong historical/biographical thread. Solidly interesting overall."
7,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"This was an interesting book, but at some moments I barely could follow Zimmer's story. This has undoubtedly to do with my lack of knowledge about paleontology and embryology, two fields of research that figure prominently in At the Water's Edge.Zimmer chooses to treat two ideas in one book - the evolution of tetrapods (from lungfish to reptiles) and the evolution of whales (from hooved animals to sperm and baleen whales). Zimmer uses these two cases to illustrate an important biological concept: macroevolution - radical changes in morphology in (evolutionarily speaking) short timespans. These macroevolutions are partly external (changes in the organism's environment such as climate and competition) and partly internal (the bodyplan of building embryos, inherited through its ancestors). In other words: the reason why whales have baleens and reptiles didnt'have them, has to do with the bodyplan of whales (mammal embryology) and the bodyplan of reptiles (reptilian embryology).I'm neither a paleontologists nor a molecular biologist, so I'm not really up to date on the scientific progress on these discoveries. Zimmer describes the state of events around 1996, and I can only imagine that in the meantime some evolutionary puzzles have been solved (and possibly new ones popped up). When Zimmer writes about the difficulties of drawing trees of descent and the controversies between morphological tree-builders and molecular tree-builders, I can only imagine what the outcome of these issues is going to be. I like it that Zimmer chooses to start with the founding fathers of biology (Owen, Cuvier, Geoffroy, among others) this helps to put the larger picture in perspective. I also like it that Zimmer throughout the book interviews modern day scientists about the topics involved.The story of the origin of tetrapods is easy to summarize: about 400 million years ago the first jawed fish appeared; after 50 million years the lineages of amphibians and amniotes split; another 50 million years later the first herbivorous amniotes appeared. The way these tetrapods evolved to adapt themselves to a new environment (land, plant eating) was constrained by their body plan (i.e. ancestral genes). The story of the origin of whales is somewhat murkier, partly due to the debate about the right ancestral tree. In broad outlines: 50 million years ago the first ruminants appeared; 15 million years later the odontocetes (dolphins, killer whales, etc.) and the mysticetes (blue whales, sperm whales, etc.) originated. Genetic research indicates that the closest living animal of whales is the hippopotamus, while paleontologists dispute this fact and claim whales share a common ancestor with artidactyls (all the animals with even numbered hoofs). The niches these whales picked out to make a living, the ways they communicate and the workings of their respiratory systems all depend on their ancestral mammal body plan. This is the reason whales have to breathe oxygen from the atmosphere, while fish can remain underwater. Even though at some points it was hard for me (as a layman) to keep up with the story, I truly enjoyed this book. I learned some interesting things along the way - macroevolution, the importance of bodyplans and embryology, the use of convergent methods (genes, bones) to draw up trees of descent, the basic outlines of how fish evolved to land dwellers and how some branches of mammals went back to the sea and became whales - and that is what I look for in books. "
8,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717592-martin,3,"This was a man's first book? Now that's impressive. However, this is most decidedly not for the layman, a lesson the author learned because his books that followed are much more readable. He's brave too, selecting as a salvo the one topic most murky with incompleteness and conjecture. It's as if he was saying with his endeavor: ""Here's a subject with the most gaps in the field. I'll start with this, write several more interesting books, and see where we stand after I establish an interesting career."" It's quite possible he could soon offer a followup version that is more fossil-y complete. After all, there are dozens more dinosaurs roaming the earth now than there were when I was a child."
9,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2933858-alessia,3,"Interesting enough, but very erratic at times, especially in the chapters dedicated to whales' evolution. Plus it's a bit outdated now, and doesn't take into consideration (at least not enough) the power of the molecular techniques as tools to phylogeny. Morphology is all very well but the issue of how it can lead to confusing results, mixing convergence for homology is not addressed fully. Probably not the best book on evolution, even if maybe it's a good starting point; it was just verging too much on the ""pop side"" of pop science for me."
10,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/295746-bkwurm,5,"A clear and concise narration of the discovery of fossils that prove that tetrapod life emerged from the water onto the land via the evolutionary process and how one group of mammals returned to the sea and evolved into the whales, dolphins and porpoises we see today. The science demonstrating the connections between the fossils is well explained. The transitions from fish to land dwelling tetrapods and from mammal to whale are beautifully illustrated. A must read."

Car Zimmer writes with clarity and just enough wit to make his readers feel smart just for following along.The subtitle really says all you need to know; if you love reading about biology, zoology, evolution (I know someone else does) you will learn and be entertained."
12,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1387036-bill,3,Here is a book that tries to connect the missing link dots in a few species both living and extinct to prove evolution is correct. Perhaps the reader really has to be an evolutionist to really enjoy this book. I found it a a bit slow and technical for my taste. Then I discovered it was published twenty years ago which means it may or may not be hopelessly out of date given the quick changes in scientific theory these days. You might want to read something more current on the subject. 
13,0684856239,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71230800-dan-carpenter,3,Some parts were interesting but the author spent too much time on trivial historical details of paleontologists searching for and taking about their fossils. Something positive is that the book focuses heavily on the first creatures to leave the ocean and on whales re-entering the ocean.

It is the only book that clearly shows how natural selection and evolution really >work< through macroevolution, or the evolution of large body structures. The story that Zimmer relates of how some critters have gone into the sea, back to the land, and repeated this several times, taught me stuff that even I hadn't heard about (as an eclectic reader of evolutionary biology tomes). There's also a fine amount of the history of paleontology woven into the book, along with a great review of recent paleotological field work and what it means to our understanding of various dead critters. Read this book not only for the pleasure of the reading, but because it will easily supply you with rebuttal points for some of the creationist/ID drivel that still flutters around the US of A. Tom."

I confess that I may not have followed every nuance, but I got the main ideas.The thing I wish Zimmer had dwelt on perhaps just a bit more was the idea of macro-evolution, as the book's blurb indicated.At one point near the end of the book, maybe even the last chapter, he says (something along the lines of) ""Scientist X says, Macro-evolution is just micro-evolution left going for a long time, but is it really?""But then he doesn't come out and say, in so many words, what else it could be. At least, not that I picked up. Maybe I'm dense. :)Anyway, I would still recommend it. It's probably one I should read more than once, but I doubt I will, simply because of the number of other books in the world I still haven't read."
