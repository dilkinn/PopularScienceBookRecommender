0,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"It’s difficult to read this title without thinking of Philip K. Dick’s story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep which was (very loosely) translated in the movie Blade Runner. Actually it’s difficult to read the title of this book at all because of strangely wordy cover. But what’s inside is not a freak show, but rather an exploration of some of the more bizarre experiments that scientists have in all honest decided to take on.This is a field that is already covered by the igNobels (annual awards for real scientific papers that make you laugh and then make you think) and the Darwin Awards for people who do such stupid things they end up removing themselves from the gene pool. But Alex Boese treads a middle line of real scientific experiments – often major pieces of research – that sound mind boggling or just surely would never happen. But did. (Apart from nuking the Moon which ‘nearly happened’.)If it wasn’t such an overused simile I’d say it was a roller coaster of a read – a very interesting mix of ups and downs, from the man who had an unhealthy relationship with a source of electricity to people who thought it would be educational to get two people to pretend to have a gun fight in the middle of a lecture. Not to mention the thousand tonne rocket propelled by hydrogen bombs that was genuinely worked on by American scientists at the end of the 1950s. It’s certainly an eye-opener!Although the experience of reading the book was good, with an excellent mix of narrative and science fact, there were a couple of points I wasn’t so sure of. Each section started with a dramatisation of an event (Benjamin Franklin attempting to electrocute a turkey and instead shocking himself, for instance). These felt a little false, as if it were drama for the sake of it. And occasionally the author was perhaps a little loose with facts. He says, for example, that lightning is the biggest natural disaster killer worldwide – by most measures it comes in behind droughts and flooding/tsunamis at the very least.Overall, though an excellent romp through some weird and wonderful scientists and their exploits that genuinely does both entertain and inform in equal measure.Review first appeared on www.popularscience.co.uk and is reproduced with permission"
1,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890789-jess,4,Human kind is unbelievable. This book made me physically sick to my stomach numerous times. Fantastic!
2,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233738-michael,3,"Quick, what mad scientist first revived a shock victim using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation? And who was the victim? Answer: The scientist was Ben Franklin, and the victim was a chicken. And that’s just one of the weird stories in this collection."
3,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12138532-guillermo-galvan,4,"It seems as if there isn't anymore ""neat"" stuff anymore. Well, at least since the 90's ended. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? From the look of the cover, I knew this book was filled with plenty of neat stuff. It promised true stories about chimpanzee butlers, the day the soviets almost nuked the moon, liquid sunshine, and a zombie chicken. No connoisseur of the bizarre can resist that Bradburyesque lineup.I should have taken the title, Electrified Sheep, literally since the first quarter deals almost exclusively with the history of shocking animals to death. This isn't what I signed up for. I can't see why Alex Boese decided to hammer on the issue of animal cruelty. Maybe he wanted to make a point about science and morality (or the lack thereof). This opener really deflated my anticipation for a zany read. Three months later the electrocution stories remained fixed in my mind. The remainder livens up by delivering weird stories that fun to read. Boese writes in a reserved attitude with occasional dry humor, letting the outrageous nature of the events speak for themselves. The organization of the book is as follows: A fictional reenactment presents the historical persons in a moment of their extreme eccentricity. These scenes are always funny and keeps the story focused on the personalities involved. Afterwards, the rest of the article is written in lighthearted, semi-academic style.This is a pretty cool book. It's the kind of book you might persuade your non-reading friend to read.""C'mon, you should read this.""""Nah, man, books are hella boring.""""There's monkey butlers in it.""""Alright, give me that."" "
4,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764887-donald-armfield,3,"This is A 3.5 rating the opening studies are extremely boring. Chapter 1: Electric BodiesThe study of electric goes to the animals one thing I will remember next time the lights go out with no sign of a storm, then that is pay back from the pigeons.Chapter 2: Nuclear ReactionsMuch better section the things scientist to with Atomic Bombs will definitely leave your jaw with awh stuck.Chapter 3: Deceptive WaysVery boring!Chapter 4: Monkeying AroundScientist trying to make monkeys civilized and why not figure out if a female monkey has an orgasm**Spoiler Alert**The signs of orgasms appear with facial expressions and grabbing its mate head, but like mens nipples there is no need, so the science table is still open if any one wants to take the studies further.Chapter 5: Do-it-yourselfersThe best chapter of them all, like Boeses' other bizarre experiments explained I was use to.Scientist of the late 1800s swallowed nuts, bolts, vomit and urine to give us an idea in such cases. The painful reading section for us men will be the smashing of genitals with hammers and weights in frying pans resting on testis just to see what kind of pain it causes?? Self surgery, with cocaine and many other do-it-yourself, don't try this at home painful suggested reading, I recommend to definitely read this chapter."
5,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"If you were a Mad Scientist - what experiment would you conduct?I would embed the workings of a smartphone in people's brains and synch it up with their eyes and ears etc. (instead of a screen, microphone and speakers etc.) just to see if having a secret smartphone would mean they would spend more time inside their heads/smartphones.I guess on the outside, they would just look a little distracted (and maybe drool a little more), but apart from that, who would be able to tell that they were watching the latest episode of 'Arrow' instead of preparing that oh-so-important spreadsheet....and, of course, I'd be able to spy on them from the inside.Mwahaha!Oh, the book - almost forgot about that.It's a lot more involved and much less funny than the prequel (Elephants on Acid: And Other Bizarre Experiments)."
6,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3241746-jeanine,3,"Not as good as the first book, Elephants on Acid. Maybe if you read this book first it wont be so disappointing. The book rehashes some of what was said in the first book and honestly I would advise people to read the first book and skip this one. "
7,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066546-michelle,3,"Some good stories, some dumb ones, some funny ones, some I didn't even want to read. Kind of a mixed bag."
8,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27645808-heather,3,"This book reminded me that science isn't always as straightforward as I think, but this title was fun nonetheless. However, the last chapter made me feel a bit ill- some people do some strange things to themselves in the name of science."
9,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61070283-hannah,3,"Fairly unchallenging read but enjoyed learning about electrified school kids, rampaging elephants. The chapter on the metallic metals was very funny and about the nazi's nuking the moon made me chuckle! "
10,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11629859-sarah,4,An interesting collection of eccentric individuals who toed the line between science and madness.
11,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10921665-seren,3,"For some reason, I struggled to get started with this. Once I did, I really enjoyed the section on early primate research."
12,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14062040-jessica,3,"Quite the collection of experimenters. All the stories are pretty short, good to pick up and put down often."
13,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30147744-richard,4,More tales of eccentric scientists. Informative and entertaining.
14,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75389318-gregorio-bravo,3,Not as good as Elephants on Acid but still a good reading time
15,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5989098-hannah,4,"A rambling narrative exploring four fields of scientific enquiry; electricity, nuclear bombs, psychology and scientists who dice with death. I really enjoyed the quirky tales of unusual science experiments, written in a comfy prose. Definitely going to search out Boese's other books."
16,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7878763-janell,5,"A really interesting book about a lot of ""forgotten"" experiments in science. Both interesting and sad, and an amazing read! "
17,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3971887-rebecca,4,"Boese collects some very interesting experiments here. And some that are less interesting than gross. I liked the book and I found it fascinating in places but I squirmed a little in places too. The experiments are grouped together in chapters so the similar ones are together but there are short little stories with headings every few pages or so, so it is a good book to sit down and read for a while or if you only have a few minutes at a time. Everything here was done in the name of science and it seemed like the scientists truly had good intentions but their methods can get kind of rough. Animals were hurt in the process here. And you will see some dedicated scientists operate on themselves and expose themselves to disease (including eating vomit of fever victims). It is interesting to see the scientific process as the men try to work out the unknown. And it is interesting to see how thin the line between dedication and crazy is. I learned about a lot of things I had never of heard of before and had a great time doing it. But, like I said, it can get unpleasant at times so think carefully before you read this, especially if you are an animal lover or have a weak stomach."
18,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20350306-caitlin,3,"Definitely a pop science book, with the start of each section having a (at least partially fantasised) dramatic section. In fact, while it is a pop science book, there is a lot of history in there (which is probably quite expected given the subject matter).It is organised into, electricity, nuclear reactions etc., and starts of with the section containing the title story, electricity. However, I felt that this was too large a section, and toward the end of it, I had become quite bored of hearing more and more about the mad things some people did with electricity before much was known about it.By far the most interesting section was the middle one, on deception in psychology (and psychiatry), and I'd been aware of some of the bits in there before!Overall, I think it was well-written, interesting to read and easy to follow, I just wish there had been a bit more variation in topic."
19,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"A collection of mad, foolhardy and gross scientific advancements that have been made by scientists that are on the very edge of the scientific community.Covers people who have eaten all manner of things, have poisoned themselves, have tried to tech chimp to become low IQ worker and pushed their own bodies to the limits of what they could do.The chapter on electricity is fascinating, as this was an age of discovery. The psychology chapter has been covered in greater detail in other books, but fits well in here. Some of the things that scientists and the military industrial complex wanted to do with nuclear bombs is quiet scary. The final chapter is gross."
20,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2056048-talia,3,"Alex Boese presents an interesting book about some of the incredibly odd and often times disturbing things people have done in the name of science. I particularly enjoyed the section about electricity and the development of our understanding of it today. Due to this book, I've lost all respect for Thomas Edison and the heinous things he did to animals. Many of the experiments described in the book were very fascinating, but some just grossed me out and left me shaking my head. An enjoyable read, but it's good to have a strong stomach when reading."
21,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2374958-brendan,3,"I found this book less enjoyable than Elephants on Acid. Boese seemed to dwell more on the history of the experiments leading to a dryer read. Also, many of the ""experiments"" talked about in this book aren't truly bizarre. That's not to say they are uninteresting, but I think Boese covered the cream of the crop in his first book leaving this one a a little disappointing. Boese did have some moments when his commentary lead me to laugh out loud, but generally this book was a pale shadow of its predecessor. "
22,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5722821-sara-gray,3,"This was a fairly engaging series of short essays and stories about various ""mad"" scientists and the experiments that made them (in)famous. Josh and I especially enjoyed the ones about toxinologists who let themselves be bit by black widow spiders and other creepy crawlies. I could have done without the introductory ""stories"" that headed each chapter, as they ended up being fairly redundant. The author also had a hard time closing each chapter, ending on a pat or silly concluding sentence that was often corny or glib. Overall, it was an entertaining nonfiction read."
23,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23606512-elizabeth-kennedy,2,"Finally finished this book. Not listed highest in my recommendations because of the first several chapters consisting of lectures in electricity and nuclear energy, the book became slightly more interesting towards the end. However gruesome and reprehensible the experiments were, it is interesting to note that many medical procedures and much of the scientific facts that are common knowledge today, would be unknown without these crazy scientists. I liked the information but much was upsetting and even more of it made it so boring I couldn't read it faster."
24,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8577532-lucy,2,"Interesting. Odd. Weird.Be careful not to eat before some of the reading, or plan to eat afterward. Parts of this book may affect your gross-out factor.Main chapters are: Electric bodies; Nuclear reactions; Deceptive ways; Monkeying around; Do-it-yourselfers.It's amazing what scientists put themselves, their loved ones, and innocent animals through, often without any knowledge gained or progress made."
25,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,5,"Incredibly interesting collection of mad science research, easy to understand while still providing unusual and often little known information. I warn any reader that it can get deeply disturbing at times, all the more so since you know it's true. I had to skip some paragraphs becuase of this. All the same, it's a worthwhile read, and certainly teaches you about the giants whose shoulders we stand on, and their weird perversions done in the name of science."
26,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9323523-ray,4,"It's been a while since I read Boese's similarly-themed Elephants On Acid, so I may be wrong in this, but this definitely feels more structured, better put together. The stories within of scientists, and the peculiar and unorthodox lengths they'll go to, remain fascinating, and at times hilarious. At others, they become shocking, particularly when animals are involved. But nevertheless, as a testament to man's curiosity, it's definitely worth dipping into."
27,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4296229-michaeld,5,"This was a very interesting book. From the time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Alex Boese covered a lot of quirky research starting from the late 1700's - some of them I couldn't believe, so I had to dig deeper (I ended up confirming the text).Very fun and interesting read. If enjoy understanding where and how things jump-started, this book is that with humor inserted. "
28,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19565136-swati-rane-levendovszky,4,"I love this book, I have not finished it yet but am almost there. It talks about different scientific experiments men conducted on their paths to discovering great things and also failing in their quests. It is humbling to know the passion that drives us and also makes you uneasily aware of the times when we just crossed the boundaries that define a scientific experiment."
29,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281331-dawn-stricker,4,I almost gave it three stars because some of it is difficult to read. I reconsidered though as it is well written and interesting stuff. It's not Alex Boese's fault some of it is so cringe worthy and nauseating. 
30,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,2,"I actually got bogged down. I wasn't finding the stories as interesting as I had hoped, and something about the writing bugged me. I'll probably finish it eventually. But onward, through my reading list."
31,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51851141-sydne,3,"I got this book after really enjoying Elephants on Acid; however this book is more in depth and about 20% longer than a comfortable read. I completely understand that every story needed to be told the way it was and that just took some pages, but I still like Elephants on Acid better. "
32,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10780898-jody-nicholson,4,I lost interest at the second chapter which meant the book went back on the shelf for a while. The other 4 chapters are extremely interesting though.
33,0752227386,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10886536-emma,4,  Interesting and fun complication of odd stories. The book lacked any form of analysis. It felt as if it was just story after story. But fun :)
