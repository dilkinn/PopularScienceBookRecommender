0,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4," Note: I wrote this review sometime before Gould's death. How does one write about a book of essays? Ever Since Darwin is a collection of essays drawn from Natural History magazine for which Gould wrote a monthly column entitled ""This View of Life."" While not especially easy reading, all the essays provide an intellectual delight that make them well worth the effort. A common thread running through all is the wonder and amazement Gould has for the extraordinary variation and adaptability of nature. One can see in these essays the development of ideas more fully defined in Wonderful Life The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History  His examples are most absorbing and occasionally bizarre. He explains how the tiny gall midge reproduces in two ways: either normally from eggs as sexually reproducing flies; or without the aid of a father, i.e., via parthenogenesis, otherwise known as virgin birth. When food is abundant (midges feed primarily on mushrooms) the young grow in the mother's body feeding on her flesh. After she has been consumed they emerge and within two days their own children begin to feed off the parent. This matricide which at first glance might appear somewhat foolish is not just a disgusting freak of nature. As Gould points out, in light of evolutionary theory, the behavior is truly efficient and adaptive. As long as food is plentiful reproduction remains parthenogenetic. As food inevitably becomes scarcer the flies reproduce normally (hate to use the word normal in this context) at which point they can fly and scout out new food sources. ""The flightless parthenogenic female stays on the mushroom and feeds. When it exhausts its resources it produces winged descendants to find new mushrooms."" This still does not answer the question of why matricide? Gould explains better than I (read the essay entitled ""Why should a fly eat its mother?;"" but, basically it has to do with adaptability to environments which impose irregular catastrophic mortality (fairly common in nature,) or where food sources are hard to find but abundant when located. The best adaptability is to ""reproduce like hell while you have the ephemeral resource, for it will not last long and some of your progeny must survive to find the next one."" Whether this lesson should be applied to Man I will not hazard a guess.Gould recognizes the social and cultural influences of the scientific imagination. Theories, at their best, should free us from our prejudices, at their worst they support the biases of their creators (witness Wolcott and his misinterpretation of the Burgess Shale), illustrated also in the attempts to find parallels between individual development and evolutionary history. (Gould has another book Ontoqeny and Phyloqeny dealing with just this issue which I have not yet read, but will soon?) Gould is very skeptical of biological determinism. (At a recent conference I witnessed E.O. Wilson, author of Sociobiology The New Synthesis, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition , a proponent of biological determinism, and Gould argue these points, much to the fascination of the audience. Gould argues for biological potentiality.) Biological determinism has become popular in Gould's mind because it allows us to escape responsibility, e.g. the homeless are inevitably thus because they inherited the wrong genes; we can fob off responsibility for war to man's inherent aggressiveness rather than to blame the political structures we have created. Several essays deal with just such issues. Obviously I have not come close to doing justice to this richly diverse and fascinating collection of essays. Read the book, I guarantee you will be fascinated."
1,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8360313-nathan,3,"If there's an overarching theme in these fascinating essays it's that scientists (and science) are just as vulnerable to political and social bias as everyone else, and we should be skeptical of claims that the scientific ""facts"" support a given political or social view. Unfortunately, in my reading, the author seems concerned with this misuse of science only when it's in support of philosophical ideals that he does not share. While he presents his own view as enlightenedly multifarious, it comes across more as an argument for the other extreme, only from a defensive position. Here's an example:I do not claim that intelligence, however defined, has no genetic basis—I regard it as trivially true, uninteresting, and unimportant that it does.In a book where there is no detail too small to inspire impassioned debate, a notion suddenly becomes ""trivial, uninteresting, and unimportant,"" the moment it doesn't directly bolster the author's egalitarian social views or may come to an uncomfortable conclusion.He goes on to claim,Our job is simply to provide the best environmental situation for the realization of valued potential in all individuals.Our job? As scientists? As human beings? It's unfortunate that an otherwise astute book that cautions against being too eager to derive philosophical conclusions from mere facts contains a smattering of political statements derived from nothing at all. It's as if the author seeks to bolster his well-meaning social ideals, not by finding support for them, but by arguing the fallibility of science proper."
2,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049744-daniel-gon-alves,4,"In this collection of scientific essays, Stephen Jay Gould promises to shine a light on Darwin’s dangerous and revolutionary idea, whilst informing the reader – in a comprehensive and adequate prose – about the new advancements in the field. The writing is lucid and compelling. The subjects are varied and detailed. And while it presents the reader with data and information about the various ideas floating around in the scientific community, it never asserts anything: the reader has to make their own conclusions. After all, that might be the ultimate purpose of a good essayist. Many people acknowledge Charles Darwin as the most brilliant scientist of all time. In 1859, he proposed a theory that would soon alter the perception of life on planet Earth. Until the 19th century, nobody had a conclusive scientific answer. For all purposes, all species on Earth had been created at a single moment in time by a divine entity. And although there are some who still hold their faith in that specious premise, today it is no longer a plausible idea. In essence, the evidence for evolution is abundant. More than a hundred years later, a lot of momentous events occurred: scientist discovered genetics, and fossil evidence was unearthed from the ground. There was a lot that Darwin did not know. That did not stop him from devising the most important theory in all biology."
3,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47352429-santiago-hernandez,4,"“Ever Since Darwin” overall is a great read and is a great way to immerse yourself in the world of evolution. In this book, Dr. Stephen Jay Gould tackles various topics that fall within the realm of evolution, the history of evolution as a field of science, and even the biological arguments against racism and human nature.As stated before, this is a great book for further exposing yourself to the concept of evolution and the information surrounding it. Dr. Gould presents various cases from human evolution to the literal exploration of the evolution of life. In addition to this topic, Dr. Gould touches upon some of the history behind evolution starting with Charles Darwin himself and ending with the way natural selection was used to justify various outrages points of view.One of the largest issues, in my opinion, that this book makes an effort to fight is racism and it in no sense of the word fails. Dr. Gould uses a variety of information from the field of Biology to prove to the reader that scientifically humans are but one species and cannot be logically separated into different groups.All the way to the end, Dr. Gould’s “Ever Since Darwin” bombards the reader with information pertaining to evolution and ultimately shows her/him how far it’s come as a field. If there’s one thing I should point out, it’s that this book can prove to be quite hard to read at times with all the scientific jargon that it contains, and so I recommend that any reader should read this book (in order to get the most out of it) in a setting where they aren't pressured to read it by a certain deadline. Take the book in little by little and I’m sure that Dr. Gould’s prose will at least impart something interesting and worthwhile to your internal data bank."
4,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/822721-clare-bell,5,"Stephen J. Gould was a treasure of a science writer, who left us far too early, in 2003. Ever since I stumbled across his column in Natural History Magazine, I've been an avid Gould reader. This is his first collection of the Natural History columns, and, although not as brilliant as his later works, contains the promise that emerged in The Panda's Thumb, The Flamingo's Smile, and others. Even so, by itself, it is amazing. Gould's work has definitely shaped my view of evolution and biology. Many times I thought of sending him a copy of my fiction about how a society of sapient large cats might develop, but I waited until too late. He has delighted and enlightened me over the years, and his books have a place of honor on my ""keeper"" shelf. I re-read them constantly."
5,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510944-anima,5,"I very much enjoyed reading this collection of unique essays which explores, from a geologists’ point of view, few scientific theories that were popular about 40 years ago. All 33 essays are awesome. Essays number 6 (about 'ladder' vs 'bushes' ) and 9 (about Irish Elk) caught my attention with few things that I've never heard about. In essay number 6, ‘ Bushes and Ladders in Human Evolution’, Gould rejects the “ladder” representation of the human evolution from 'Australopithecus africanus' to 'Homo sapiens' introducing the “bush metaphor” saying that species did not “morphed” into the next one but rather “overlapped in time”-“In this paradigm, speciation – the formation of new species – occurs by branching off from the ancestral stock, while the ancestors continue on. The details of the process are fuzzy, but proponents argue that it almost always occurs in small, isolated populations … in marginal environments …”Essay number 9,’ The Misnamed, Mistreated, and Misunderstood Irish Elk’ evolves around the extinct Irish Elk known for its super-sized antlers –about 12 feet across a pair. Some scientists were supporting the idea that the antlers were increasing in size ‘ generation after generation’ and because very big antlers would have impeded eventually the Elk's overall function, the species disappeared. Trying to find out if it there is evidence for the ‘allometric’ correlation, Gould gathered specimens, did the measurements , and discovered that antlers were increasing “about two and a half times faster than the rest of the deer.” “ In spite of this apparent success, Gould remained dissatisfied. Can we really know that the giant antlers offer no selective advantage?, he asks rhetorically. Darwin …speculated that larger antlers might serve a role in sexual selection (“selected” as attractive by the female), rather than as better armament against predators or rivals. Another possibility, Gould suggests, is that they were used against rivals in “ritual combat” rather than literal combat; … In either case, we cannot dismiss the possibility that the antlers drove the size of the deer, rather than vice versa”"
6,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"Solid introduction to Gould's perspective on evolution and other issues in modern science. The essays were written in the late 1970s, but they still feel current-- I especially enjoyed his meditations on the Irish Elk, the role of size in evolutionary development, and the shakeup caused by the discovery of plate tectonics in the late 1960s. Towards the end of the book he gets a little hung up on his politics-- as an enlightened highly liberal humanist, he has little time or sympathy for scientists who distort the facts to match their conservative/racist/classist/sexist ideologies. That whole series of essays is praiseworthy and impossible to disagree with, but in the age of Obama, it feels a little bit dated and strident. And after reading ten essays where Gould assails the impact of conservative politics on science, even the most liberal reader has got to wonder: in what ways did Gould's own liberal bent bias his results?"
7,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659760-john-miller,5,"a lot... makes science very enjoyable and readable without dumbing it down one bit, but just by eliminating jargon. puts science in its social context, and ties it in with other fields of life and learning. also compares general phenomenon in evolution as a system to other types of systems.. .. .Must read one of his books!"
8,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92136859-dany,4,"""In the conventional model of scientific ""progress,"" we begin in superstitious ignorance and move toward final truth by the successive accumulation of facts. In this smug perspective, the history of science contains little more than anecdotal interest–for it can only chronical past errors and credit the bricklayer for discerning glimpses of final truth. It is as transparent as an old-fashioned melodrama: truth (as we perceive it today) is the only arbiter and the world of past scientists is divided into good guys who were right and bad guys who were wrong."""
9,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6903379-reid,4,"What can I say? Pretty fascinating in parts, it seems dated and alive at the same time. I'm familiar with some of the basics, which probably prevented me from being enthralled, but he is definitely a very good essayist with a broad liberal viewpoint, which I appreciated. I definitely want to read more of his books, I should have read them long ago.Some personal highlights:Was strange when he mentioned that plate tectonics was a fairly new theory, within the last 10 years of his writing, in '75 and '76, because although I learned about continental drift, it seemed like no time had passed when I learned of tectonics in school as well. At the time I had no idea it was a new theory.I knew Darwin was not nearly the first to theorize about evolution, but he was about the only one that didn't rely on an ultimate supernatural force for the mechanism - more than half of the reason he was revolutionary was because of his ""uncompromising philosophical materialism."" I guess I take that for granted. Which is why I also got a big laugh out of Gould's opening sentence of Chapter 10: ""Since man created God in his own image..."" I said the same thing in my freshman college class of the politics of underdevelopment. For some reason God came up and I offered an opposing view, saying the very same thing as Gould. It was a conversation stopper.Most fascinating in a sci fi way was his chapter on size, growth, and the increasing ratio of volume to surface size, and then takes you through the absurdities of some sci fi movies, like the giant ant movie Them and the tiny human movie, what, The Incredible Shrinking Man, and how many of the actions would be impossible. For example, with a human the size of an ant, s/he could not overcome surface adhesion forces, so could never remove an article of clothing; or how the smallest drop of water from a ""shower"" would likely kill you. Related to evolution, he mentions that a human half our size couldn't wield a weapon with enough force to take down a large animal, since kinetic forces shrink with size as well. His main point being that size is a major aspect of evolution, and there are limitations and advantages with most developments of size, one way or the other. Another example is how insects with exoskeletons (and lobsters and crabs) can afford to molt because the surface adhesion forces are greater than gravity's force on them, keeping the creatures in their shape, whereas if we were to molt, gravity would turn us into puddles of goo.Something, by name, I hadn't known - the concept of neoteny (""holding youth"") - how human evolution has included the retardation or slowing down of ""maturation"" in the womb, as compared to other primates. Our brain may grow larger due to retaining rapid fetal growth rates, whereas those rates decrease sooner for other primates. Of course, our ""soft spot"" doesn't fuse until well after birth, and the ends of our digits and long bones are still cartilaginous at birth - that's why baby fingers are so rubbery. One other difference is that other primates ""begin"" with 5 aligned toes, but later the great toes rotate outward to oppose the other toes - luckily that doesn't happen with us, otherwise we'd be walking like orangutans. Perhaps some of the list he includes isn't neoteny, but just basic different evolution? I don't know. Apparently there have been some professional disagreements with some other parts of this book, but nothing earth shattering for most readers. Some of them are mentioned on his Wiki article.Another pretty fascinating chapter is on ""life history strategies"" - how some species, like some cicadas and bamboo have evolved to survive their predators by only reproducing in huge numbers in long primary-numbered years, such as 17 years for some cicadas, and 120 years (!)(ok, doesn't need to be primary) for a certain bamboo! The survival advantage being that no predator or their offspring could possibly align their production numbers to gorge on and wipeout that many offspring at such an ""unpredictable"" timeframe. (Bamboo and cicadas are apparently very very tasty to a lot of animals!)This is probably his most basic and ""beginner"" book, and as such, it's a pretty good intro to one of the best popular science writers to walk the earth. I should mention, too, he's known for criticizing bad science and biased thinking, and he'll often point out our arrogance, folly, and racism, and how even in science the privileged often defend the existing social arrangements. The essays in this book are wide ranging - you're bound to appreciate many of them."
10,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,2,"This book explores various topics related to evolution. Darwin pretty much nailed it, and his discoveries are still the foundation of modern biology. However, much has happened since Darwin, and that's what this book discusses. Some of the articles were fairly interesting, like the one about Darwin's friendship with the captain of the H.M.S. Beagle, and how size of body structures influence its shape.I could have done without his politics at the end. He favorably quotes socialists and feminists, such as Friedrich Engles' claim that evolution is all about labor, Ashley Montagu's claim that women are superior to men due to neoteny, and Simone de Beauvoir's claim that human beings have no essence. He complains that some of the early biologists were racist and sexist (big shock, so was everyone else back then). As if the claim that women are biologically superior to men is somehow not sexist. He only seems to like abusing science for political ends if they agree with his views.He detests any claims of biological determinism. His reasoning is that determinists have been wrong in the past, and this can be used to justify prejudice. But here's the thing. This is science. People are wrong all the time in science. It's a self-correcting system. We learn from our mistakes and move on. Just because a claim is unpleasant or abused by bigots does not mean we should refuse to study it, for the simple reason that not understanding nature does not make nature go away. If science is abused by political ideologues, that is the fault of the ideologues, not of the scientists for asking questions about nature.He acknowledges this: ""Of course, no view should be rejected because we dislike its implications. Truth, as we understand it, must be the primary criterion. But the claims of determinists have always turned out to be prejudiced speculation, not ascertained fact."" In other words, we shouldn't bother researching it at all because these claims are just always wrong, period. His only evidence is a couple of anecdotes. But even if he's right that every deterministic hypothesis ever made, ever, has proven false, it was still useful to research it because we learn just as much from disproven hypotheses as proven ones. Disproving hypotheses is not considered a failure in science.He claims that ""the hallmark of humanity is not only in our mental capacity but also our mental flexibility. We have made our world and we can change it."" This is true, and yet that does not mean there can't also be nature that tilts people in certain directions. People can be genetically predisposed, inclined to behave in certain ways, and still choose not to behave in those ways. Sometimes they should choose to go against their nature (e.g. if they're sociopathic) and sometimes they shouldn't (e.g. if they're homosexual). Knowing our genetic predispositions ahead of time allows us to change ourselves and our world for the better.He asks, ""why are we so intrigued by hypotheses about innate disposition? Why do we wish to fob off responsibility for our violence and sexism upon our genes?"" Because that's what biology does. It researches nature. It's about understanding ourselves, not ""fobbing off responsibility."" If there is a biological component to violence, it would be useful to know that. The whole point of biology is to learn about our nature so we can manipulate it to improve our quality of life, and yet he seems to believe that it's all about throwing up our hands and giving up because it's just in our nature.I guess what bugs him is that, in addition to teaching us what we can change, science can also teach us what we can't change, and this is uncomfortable news. For example, we can't fly. We just can't. No amount of ""mental flexibility"" will change that. But by knowing that we can't fly no matter what, we won't waste our time and energy on it. Instead, we can use science in ways we can change. We can discover the laws of aerodynamics, so even though we can't fly, we can build machines that can. Understanding what is in our nature and beyond our control is paradoxically liberating and can lead to wonderful changes.Anyway, those are just a few things at the end that seemed boneheaded. As I said, the rest of the book is quite reasonable and fairly interesting."
11,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51838782-lucas,4,Gould is pithy. His understanding is deep enough that he can actually describe evolution to the reader. Not every scientist can move beyond teaching and the constraints of the university. Gould always seemed unbound. He is more similar to Darwin and his coworkers than most students have a right to expect. Reveling in blessed work is enjoyable.
12,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13009180-leslie-ann,5,"As a trained biologist, I should be ashamed of waiting this long to read Gould's essays, but better late than never. I appreciated Gould's interpretation of Darwin, his stress on considering the influence of societal and political prejudices on science, and his use of literary and sports metaphors in his prose.Some memorable quotes:I am a strong advocate of the general argument that ""truth"" as preached by scientists often turns out to be no more than prejudice inspired by prevailing social and political beliefs.[A]t its most exciting, [science] reformulates our view of the world by imposing powerful theories against the ancient, anthropomorphic prejudices that we call intuition.Why do we wish to fob off responsibility for our violence and sexism upon our genes? The hallmark of humanity is not only our mental capacity but also our mental flexibility. We have made our world and we can change it.The expression of any trait represents a complex interaction of heredity and environment. Our job is simply to provide the best environmental situation for the realization of valued potential in all individuals.We live with several unpleasant biological truths, death being the most undeniable and ineluctable. If genetic determinism is true, we will learn to live with it as well. But I reiterate my statement that no evidence exists to support it, that the crude versions of past centuries have been conclusively disproved, and that its continued popularity is a function of social prejudice among those who benefit most from the status quo."
13,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8418772-victoria,5,"""But a man does not attain the status of Galileo merely because he is persecuted; he must also be right."" Gould's excellent prose and combined essays warn of hubris. Research and conclusions can be tainted by ideology. He reminds us to be aware of our biases and assumptions when crafting studies and interpreting data. Also, a reminder that we are part of the animal kingdom. This collection of essays is well worth your time.""The hallmark of humanity is not only our mental capacity but also our mental flexibility. We have made our world and we can change it."""
14,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/167115-ken-bishop,5,"Stephen Jay Gould is my favorite writer in any branch of science. He writes beautifully (loves words) and can explain anthropology to the layperson. Gould is one of the best people to correctly explain Darwin. The majority of writers who try to explain evolution, don't have a clue what they are talking about. If you are interested in this topic read all of his books. Sadly he is no longer with us, but his books live on."

16,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30490019-susan,5,"What I found most valuable about this book was Gould's careful (and sometimes irritated) explanations of evolution, what it does and doesn't do. I realized that even people who deny evolution should read it so that they at least understand what the evolution is that they reject, because common assumptions people make about evolution are not right at all."

What is amazing about his writing style is his knowledge of popular culture and how he integrates it into his writing! I found myself stopping and really thinking and reflecting about what he just said! Brilliant man! Can’t wait to read his Wonderful Life book soon!

19,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189852-nathan-box,3,"As always, this is not a book report. Rather, it is an opportunity to discuss some ideas that stuck with me while reading “Ever Since Darwin” by Stephan Jay Gould.”The Debate Should Be OverDuring the 2012 Republican Party Primary run, a debate was held where the nominees were asked to raise their hands if they believed in the theory of evolution. Most of the candidates raised their hands. As I watched, I was baffled that this is still a debate. Sure, we have learned much since Darwin first established the theory. If anything, what we learned has moved us closer, not further away from this truth. So, why the debate? Simply, religion. Evolution flies in the face of intelligent design. There are those who believe evolution might be a tool used by God, but there are vast swaths of believers who profess to biblical truth; the world was created in 7 days, man was made in the image of God, and we may have lived while dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Evolution pokes holes in the story of creation. This keeps it from being widely accepted.Legacy of Debate One of my favorite quotes from this book is the following:""As the new Darwinian orthodoxy swept through Europe, its most brilliant opponent, the aging embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer, remarked with bitter irony that every triumphant theory passes through three stages: first it is dismissed as untrue; then it is rejected as contrary to religion; finally, it is accepted as dogma and each scientist claims that he long appreciated its truth."" -Stephen Jay GouldThe theory of evolution unleashed debate across the world. Like any good theory, it was debated in the scientific community, tested, peer-reviewed, and then accepted. To this day, it is debated on the grounds of philosophy, religion, sociology, and still within the hallowed halls of academia. No theory has had such a profound impact on humankind. Beyond the debate itself, the way in which we’ve conducted ourselves while in the midst of debate has revealed much about ourselves. In my opinion, this theory and the theory of global climate change have caused something dangerous in our culture to rise, a war against intellectualism. In this war, facts don’t matter, and opinions win the day. A civil society built on the legacy of debate cannot prosper if there is no clear winner.Evolution MisusedMankind has a way of misusing new findings. Evolution was and is no different. Think of Hitler. Think of all those conversations about a superior race. Think of eugenics. Think of the harm we’ve done to each other because we didn’t fully understand a theory. When I think of the greatest invention of my lifetime, the internet, I think of the profound good connecting the entire world together can do. I also think of the myriad of ways in which it has been used to hurt people. Reflecting on evolution and where we currently find ourselves, I can’t help but think this may be the natural order of human discovery: theory, misuse, course correction. If that is the case, I hope we are soon arriving at a point in human history where the greatest inventions of our time are used for their most noble of intentions.Human NatureEvolution has much to say about human nature. It can begin to explain the way we are. It can begin to answer some of our most profound questions. How did we get here? How did the world begin? Where are we going next? How we choose to use this information is up to us. It can inform or cripple. It can answer or sow seeds of deceit. It can close gaps or deliver us to questions that can never be answered. My hope is, as with all things, that we will use it for good and to enlighten ourselves. Anything less would be a disservice to the pioneering man who first brought such an idea forward.Be good to each other,-Nathan"
20,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32563817-douglas,4,"Science has long been the hole in my education, but thanks to Stephen Jay Gould, I believe I have found a medium to at least partially fill it. This essay collection, though not uniformly excellent (as it cannot help but be, the essays being written as they are on a wide variety of topics and at different times), is fascinating and educational nonetheless. It is productive, I think, to contrast this with another well-regarded science book written at the same time but with which I was much less impressed: ""Cosmos"" by Carl Sagan. If the latter book is rather more famous, I found that it has not aged well. It is primarily concerned with conveying how amazing the stars are, but it does so over a decade before the launching of the Hubble Space Telescope, and I tired of Sagan's tone of amazement towards everything.Though I have no doubt that a biologist would find the ""what"" of much of the science to be outdated - I was surprised to see continental drift written about as a very recent development - the ""how"" is fresh and interesting. By this I mean that pretty well all of the essays I most enjoyed were those that related to method: what counts as evidence, what evidence is strong, which is weak, why are some theories accepted and not others, etc. The specifics of what exactly is being examined mattered little, as I found myself excitedly telling my girlfriend about the cyclical variations in the populations of cicadas.Still, for my next foray into Gould's work (and there will be a next), I think I will probably skip ahead a few years to get something from at least the 1990's, science advancing as rapidly as it does. But Gould writes with such clear, vigorous prose and has the range of interests and learning that I prize in a writer that I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone. Orwell, Hitchens, Sowell, and Woolf will have to make room for another member in my pantheon of favourite essayists.4/5 "
21,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11363783-angela,3,"Unlike some of the reviewers sharing the rating I have given this book, my problem is not Gould's alleged liberal humanistic standpoint. I would say that I personally share that, and his occasional flash of understanding that scientists are hampered in their thinking by social structures is very welcome to sociologists. However here Gould too often himself remains less critically analytical than he should, and still too easily retreats to commitment to the ""just so story"". Sometimes he seems to be bringing on critical analysis as a pawn to allow him to retreat to his own commitment. As is usually the case with evolutionary theory and Darwin especially, trying to build a science on the text of one man is always is danger of being snared by quasi-religious attitudes, and one sees it here even in Gould's tentative writing."
22,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37163866-kiryl-bushwackacowski,4,"Excellent book by an engaging and knowledgeable author. The part touching on sociobiology and contemporary debates raging in this area is interesting not least because Gould gives us the tools to evaluate and debunk ideas where the scientific method isn't the primary driver but merely an afterthought or a rattly scaffold upon which individuals mount their arguments.

He focuses on big topics and uses fascinating examples to illustrate his points. Gould is certainly one of the great science communicators of our time. Some of the essays are notably out of date, but this gives us insight into how far we have come and what some of the controversies in biology have (and still) exist. Most chapters are ~6-7 pages long so it is a great book to read in short bursts or to have on hand when you need to fill some town time."

I think this was because several essays were on subjects that lacked, for me, enough rootedness in the concrete - 'Science in Society', 'The Science and Politics of Human Nature', 'Size and Shape'. In the essays on Darwin himself and Evolution I felt on surer and easier ground.I'll be trying 'The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox' next."

When he turned to the subject of humans, my interest waned. Gould rightly placed a strong emphasis on debunking pseudoscientific explanations of human difference and presents an agreeably enlightened take on human genetics and evolution, but it feels like a drag."

37,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48206648-william-bibliomane,5,"This is the first volume of Gould's essays, reprinted from Natural History magazine in the days before the publication became little more than a shell of its former glory. Gould was, to my mind, a polymath. These essays may have slightly dated by now -- I read them nearly twenty-five years ago -- but this teacher's command of the language and skill in rational argument should make him required reading whether he's current or not. Good writing -- great writing -- should never go out of fashion. Just thinking about this book makes me feel as though I should read it again. Highly recommended. "
38,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866535-dave,4,"Unlike many of those who discuss the subject today, Stephen Jay Gould had a very positive and non-defensive approach to discussing evolution. “Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History” is Gould’s first book and is a collection of essays which Gould wrote between 1974 and 1977 for “Natural History Magazine”. These are organized into 8 sections which cover everything from the basics of Darwin’s theory through applications of that theory to the evolution of humans, through the history of life on Earth and the view and role of science in society. All in all there are 33 essays included on a diversity of sub-topics involving the theory of evolution, though certainly some points are repeated as one would expect when dealing with individual essays on a related subject.Stephen Jay Gould’s writing is easy to read, and these essays are targeted to people interested in science, but you don’t have to be a scientist to understand them by any means. Gould also makes the reading more entertaining by including interesting bits of trivia, such as covering who was the naturalist aboard the Beagle, correcting many bits of misinformation regarding Darwin and his theory, and discussing why Darwin waited so long before publishing. Unlike many more recent books (this book was originally published in 1977), Gould avoids getting drawn into the name calling which goes on between creationists and Darwinists. Gould’s enthusiasm for the subject comes through in his writing, and his passing in 2002 from cancer was a great loss to science, as well as to the public discussion of science to which he offered a thoughtful and insightful voice. That is not to say that Gould was never the focus of controversy, as he forced evolutionary biologists to rethink some of their ideas due to his ability to view things from a different angle. Some have claimed that his theories, such as punctuated equilibrium which he developed with Niles Eldredge, were never more than what was already contained in the theory of evolution, but I still see the echoes of his approach in many recent articles about evolution.I have heard some people claim that Gould later decided that “Ever Since Darwin” was his worst book, though I have never been able to verify this claim. It wouldn’t surprise me if that were true, as many authors cringe when looking back on their earliest works. That being said, I think the essays in this book still offer a wonderful place for those who are interested in the subject to get a good understanding of the subject and the theory. Of course, given that it was published in 1977 there is so much more that has been discovered that this should not be the only resource that one uses, especially if you want to understand the current state of the theory. "
39,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802988-john,3,"Stephen Jay Gould was a Paleontologist and scientific ""philosopher""/thinker from Queens (!!!!) who taught at Harvard and also worked for the American Museum of Natural History. This book is a collection of his monthly essays/writings for ""Natural History Magazine"" through the 1970's. In it, Mr Gould outlines the social history of the Natural Sciences from Darwin up to the present (1979). When I say, ""Social History"" I am referring to the Scientists themselves. Stephen Jay Gould is a tireless champion of Darwinian ""theory"" and a formidable opponent to any scientist or philosopher who has tried to oppose the Theory of Evolution or Natural Selection. To do so, he has used Natural History magazine (a publication of the Museum) as his ""bully pulpit"".What is remarkable about this book, is how complete a record it is of the entire history of Natural Science (literally, ""Ever Since Darwin""). Mr Gould has specifically written these articles for the layman (not the scientist) and does not assume any prior knowledge in the Natural Sciences. He starts by explaining Darwin's theories in three easy sentences, proceeds (in progressive chapters) to give you the entire history of Natural Science from it's nay-sayers to it's newest controversies. His is a mind which can teach complex issues to the would-be interested without talking down to those who take the time to read his arguments. It's a fantastic overview of the History of Natural Science from a man who spent his life studying, championing, and teaching Natural History."
40,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10134473-siria,5,"Gould's collection of essays is a must-read for both aspiring scientists and the public at large who wish to deepen their understanding of evolution and dispel pernicious misconceptions that have plagued the field since its inception in 1859 with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species. Each essay discusses an aspect of biology or evolution in the social context, or, how society (and often leading scholars in the field) have incorrectly perceived the concepts laid out in Darwin's work. The final chapter focuses on Gould's criticisms of biological determinism and the negative social impacts such a bias can engender: racism, sexism, etc. Although some essays do feel ""dated,"" particularly those covering the then-recent theory of plate tectonics, they still provide critical insight on how scientific theories are accepted or rejected in light of social biases to uphold the status quo. What makes Gould's perspective fascinating, aside from his eloquent writing style and evident mastery of his field, is his devout objectivism and insight into why even disproved theories are rational, scientific, and appropriate for the time. To dismiss the merit of Gould's work for it's datedness is as shortsighted as dismissing Darwin's work for not describing a mechanism to drive natural selection.I look forward to reading more of Mr. Gould's work and will strongly recommend it to my peers."
41,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8401086-shucheta,4,"I just love the way Gould's mind works. He is always questioning Orthodoxy, he is not blind to be fact that the way our brains process ""pure facts and data"" are highly colored by our world view and our beliefs. Science, is after all, a human activity. Gould makes a brilliant case for this contention in his essay about plate tectonics and continental drift. Gould shows that same data can be, and has been used to support two completely opposing claims of static continents and continental drifts, depending on which theory was widely accepted at the time of interpretation. This understanding makes Gould a true skeptic. I started reading this book to understand the whole ""Pluralism Vs. Adaptionism"" debate of evolution, since Gould has been one of the most vocal advocates of Pluralism. This book, however, only briefly touches the subject- in only two essays and the epilogue. Gould criticizes sociobiology because of its deterministic approach and states that a gene centric approach (adaptionism) is going too far but doesn't really provide much evidence for the latter claim. There's a lot o ""I hope"", ""I suspect"" and ""I believe""s. So the whole debate still feels like a non-debate to me. Perhaps Gould elaborates in his later books. But I can understand why Gould started questioning adaptionism, because it has become orthodox, and Gould knows that orthodoxy is anything but unshakable. "
42,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028300-glen-engel-cox,3,"Jill had been trying to get me to read Gould for over a year. She subscribes to Natural History and so had a fresh dose every month to tackle me with. And I’m not sure of my reluctance. Jill would say that it’s because I’m reluctant to do anything that she wants me to do–I’m not ready to admit that (I certainly hope that that’s not true!). I think it may have been that I didn’t want to add Natural History to my voluminous stack of stuff yet to read– cleverly forgetting, if I had ever truly realized it, that Gould’s column was collected, and continuously being collected, in a series of volumes, of which this one is the first. Maybe I just wanted to start from the beginning.It’s a good thing that Jill had introduced me to some later Gould, because this, while genuinely entertaining, and definately intellectually stimulating, is a rougher mix. Gould has grown as a writer (and probably as a scientist) since originally starting his column.This isn’t a book to try to read at one sitting (I think it’s been at my bedside for the last year) because it is thick and meaty. While Gould attempts to write at a level that a layman can understand, he doesn’t simplify things. It’s a tough slog through some of these essays, but always worth the effort. I’ve got the next volume by the bedside now, and I look forward to growing with Gould."

You will find the major themes, important histories from diaries and unfinished manuscripts, incredible obscure factoids, most tenacious debates of the last centuries and extraordinary real life examples of evolutionary theory meeting each other in a kaleidoscope of addictive writing style."
44,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8444056-todd-stark,5,"This was Gould's first published collection of his magazine columns, for essays written between 1973–1977 and it illustrates why he was justly considered a masterful essayist. He is telling us a lot about biology but he is doing it in a way that also tells us a lot about how science is done. In his memorable examples and vivid descriptions he reveals the central role of imagination in science, along with the historical and cultural shaping of our imagination. Gould's own philosophical biases are sometimes evident in his essays, as they were even more in his later book ""Mismeasure of Man,"" but in this collection throughout he is very realistic about both the strengths and limits in our scientific understanding of living things. There's a certain measured skepticism here of our grand attempts at storytelling, all the while telling his own stories to illustrate, and always retaining a deep admiration for the things nature reveals to us when we look closely, carefully, and thoughtfully. This is Gould at his best I think, a splendid example of popular science writing that is both educational and deeply reflective and sets high expectations for its readers rather than talking down to them. "
45,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1131766-abe-something,4,"I learned quite a bit reading this book. Given some of the info is outdated, some of it theoretical, and some of it is of little value to me - the beauty of this collection is the voice. Stephen Jay Gould is the Carl Sagan of Natural History. Do people call him that? They should if they aren't. I was familiar with Gould on account my taking some Anthropology 101's in undergrad about 10 years ago. I had always kept him on my list of ""accessible, fun academics I'd like to spend some more time reading in the future"". Check that box.Ever Since Darwin is a series of essay's Gould wrote for a Natural History magazine. They're collected here and organized by Gould under related subject headers.I am crazy about the theory of ""predator satiation"" a concept that, along with a handful of other ideas, has inspired me to draw a series of mini-comics sharing Gould's work with my fellow public transportation users. There are probably more relevant works to read in the realm of Natural History (I just happened to find this in a box on the sidewalk), or even more highly recommended works by Gould - but if you see a copy around read a few essays. "
46,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"All of Stephen Jay Gould's admirable traits as a splendid scientist, fine historian of science and gifted writer are prominently on display in this elegant collection of essays; the first of many he published from his celebrated essay column ""This View Of Life"", which was published for over twenty five years in Natural History, the popular journal of the American Museum of Natural History. Gould brilliantly illustrates the explanatory power of Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection, discusses some of the most fascinating discoveries from a fresh, more mathematically rigorous, approach to paleontology to which he, himself, contributed, and ruminates on the sociology of science in one exceptional essay after another. He does this in engaging, often lyrical, prose, in which he draws analogies from literature, film and baseball to make his cogent points. Anyone who enjoys great writing, especially on science, won't be disappointed with this tome nor the rest in Gould's essay collection series."
47,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7873778-jerry,3,"Written in the 70's, ""Ever Since Darwin"" is very dated, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking to broaden their understanding of evolution. However, it does provide a great insight into the mind of one of the most vocal proponents in the field - the late Stephen Gould. The most interesting is Gould's discussion of the spread of misinformation about evolution in the media. Gould talks about being angry when Punctuated Equilibrium (Gould's hypothesis that evolution happens in quick spurts of change, followed by long periods of stasis, rather than the gradual change predicted by Darwin) was hailed in newspaper headlines as the downfall of evolution. Gould's hypothesis was later abducted by religious fundamentalists who misquoted Gould's criticism of Darwinian evolution in an effort to replace science with religious fundamentalism in public schools. Ironically, Creationists and Intelligent Design proponents continue to misquote Gould to this day."
48,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882315-kevin-carlo-artiaga,5,"This book has rather been cruelly separated from me by a friend who had vowed to read it as quickly as possible and has then proceeded to ignore it for half a year. The science in it is just a bit outdated (plate tectonics was still a new thing at that time! hah!), but that in itself is interesting as it shows how biology has grown through the years. I like the fact that it explores both the subject of the science of biology as well as the scientists who on whose shoulders we are currently standing on: what drives them, their hopes and prejudices. The book has, for example, an interesting essay about Charles Darwin as the Beagle Captain's reluctant companion and how it might have influenced his writings.I am, however, more interested about the essays about the strange and wonderful living world, which I believe every person should have deeper understanding of, and this is a wonderful book which will give them just that. "
49,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373703-adrian-colesberry,5,"The greatest modern voice for the neo-Darwinian synthesis. He and a colleague, whose name I forget, re-purposed Kipling's term ""just-so stories"" to describe evolutionarily plausible but unprovable explanations for things. An amazing critical thinker, Gould realized that if you didn't establish some way of critiquing evolutionary explanations, they would become the equivalent of folk explanations, overpredicting to the point that they could never be disproven. Once evolutionary explanations became non-disprovable, it stops being a science and starts being a belief, like believing in god. So he spent a lifetime not just doing his own research but in popularizing disciplined neo-Darwinian critical thinking in this series of essays in Natural History magazine or Nature magazine, I forget. Most of my understanding of the neo-Darwinian synthesis comes from reading Gould. "
50,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,4,"When it comes to popular writings on Evolution, the two names I most often hear are Dawkins and Gould. While I've read several books from Dawkins, this is my first one from Gould. This one is in the essay format which it seems is the norm for Gould's books. Overall the essays vary in quality but for the most part they're good, although some are a little dated (which happens with any science books published 35-40 years ago). My favorite ones were the first section over Darwin and a section which looks at odd organisms. In this later section, you get some interesting essays such as one over the Irish Elk and my favorite essay about the lampsilis mussel, which makes itself look like a swimming fish in order to get attacked by larger fish, then it shoots spores into the larger fish. This book makes me want to read more of his works. "
51,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,5,"This was a fantastic survey of Darwin's theory of ""descent with modification"". I learned many fascinating tidbits, from the perhaps serendipitous occurrence of Darwin securing a spot on the Beagle's voyage--and not as the ships naturalist--to why he never explicitly used the term 'evolution' in his theory, as well as other important clarifications to supplement his theory in the prevailing biosocial ideas of the mid-19th century. Gould writes with impeccable wit and has a great objective sense to anticipate the criticisms of his own perspective, and to reply with convincing persuasion. He is a pleasure to read, and makes one hungry to follow this with his other ""Reflections"" essays published as columns in Natural History Magazine. Five stars."
52,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8721244-megan,5,"Not an essay goes by that I don't deeply regret finding Gould's work after his death. His writings are tremendous, thoughtful, and accessible. It's thanks to his work that I chose a career in science. This collection hits all his great themes. The best essays, however, are those on the philosophy of science: what it means, how it's biased, and how it still does disservice to the unfairly stereotyped. Even an earth scientist like me is given much to think about, especially about how I can better serve the public through integrity and shrewd analysis. Great for professionals, students, and thoughtful people of every kind."
53,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"This was the first collection of Gould���s articles from Natural History magazine. All the essays have some connection with the theory of evolution, either historically or as exemplifications. I read the book for the first time when it was relatively recent; today, of course, after thirty-five years, the science is somewhat dated, particularly with regard to human evolution. The essays are still fun to read, though, and many of his points are still quite relevant, especially about the misuse of science for political purposes��� it didn���t begin with the Bush administration, the Reagan administration, or even the Third Reich."
54,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015045-nola-redd,4,"An excellent collection of individual essays that fit well together. I tended to read the book by sections (of which there are eight), and each section worked well together and felt unified, rather than simply lumped together. Although the science is quite obviously dated, the history it reveals, combined with the thought processes, are very interesting. I do not pretend to be extremely knowledgeable on the subject, since my scientific bent is more inclined toward physics and astronomy than biology and genetics, but, aside from a few annoying assumptions, Gould did a great job of breaking things down for the lay person."
55,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766243-steve,4,"This book is a bit dated and some of the essays drag on a bit more than I would deem necessary, but it approaches evolutionary theory from many different angles and definitely got me thinking. I would recommend it to any of you interested in learning more about how evolutionary theory applies directly to many facets of the natural world. It's nice, too, because it is easy to skip over or skim through articles of lesser interest to you without taking away from the enjoyment or understanding of the other articles. "
56,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446806-mike-davis,4,"Gould is best known as an advocate for atheism, but those leanings are not readily apparent here. The book is a series of short essays on various aspects of evolutionary theory as seen from a 1977 perspective and as such is of historical interest. Additionally, most of what Gould says is still mainstream opinion and hasn't changed in nearly 40 years. His approach to evolution is best summed up by the last sentence in the book: ""I will rejoice in the multifariousness of nature and leave the chimera of certainty to politicians and preachers."""
57,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48354-matt,3,"Probably shouldn't have bothered with this one, since virtually every topic in this collection of essays is dealt with better and in more detail in his later works. Still, enjoyable for pointing out why you shouldn't give a dwarf a hammer, why we don't have ants the size of cars, and for containing the thunderously awesome quote ""A man does not attain the status of Galileo merely because he is persecuted; he must also be right."""

I was looking at Gould's critique of sociobiology. Gould, although one of my intellectual heroes, likes to ride the middle ground and not completely upset either side of the debate.This book is great, but I gave it three stars due to the biology-geekiness of most of the chapters."
59,0393308189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30879861-jon,4,I've read several of Stephen Jay Gould's essay collections and enjoyed them all. This is not one of my favorites simply because of the essay subjects but I still found it highly enjoyable. I think he had a gift for taking complex subjects and making them easy for the reader to understand. I highly recommend his books!
