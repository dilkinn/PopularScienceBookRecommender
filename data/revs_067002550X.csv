0,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7842767-steve-gold,2,"This is the fascinating story of a Toronto neurologist psychiatrist who travels the world fawning over sorcerers and con artists. Doidge front loads the book with his strongest cases of neuroplasticity, to lure you in, but each successive chapter retreats further from reason and evidence, until you're learning about a wizard who can heal nearly any mental or physical ailment you can name by shining LED lights at you. I think Doidge means well, and I am down with bleeding-edge science. The trick is to carefully qualify each therapy and be crystal clear about the limits of what we know. Instead, Doidge spends considerable energy dressing up the most far-fetched anecdotes to make them easier to swallow. Sometimes he seems to be trying to convince himself as much as you. There are a few significant red flags. Doidge waxes on and on about acupuncture meridian points, explaining that they haven't changed for thousands of years (a textbook argument from antiquity). I kept waiting for the paragraph qualifying that the weight of evidence shows that it doesn't matter where you stick acupuncture needles, or even *if* you stick them. It's nothing but a placebo. Doidge either isn't familiar with the research, or he's constructed one hell of a blindspot for himself. I'm guessing the latter. He also buries in the end notes his belief that autism and vaccines have a causal relationship. From a doctor engaging in public education, this is inexcusable. Every warm word he has for woo woo makes him less credible in my mind, which is a shame because he's a clear writer and his subjects have interesting stories, both personal and scientific. In the end, I don't know quite what to make of this book. It might inspire further reading, but I can't take it seriously on its own merits. "
1,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"To review this book, I have to tell you about my grandmother.When I bought my house, I was thirty years old and single - with little apparent prospect of that changing (not that I hadn't tried to get married, but all the women I'd asked to marry me - some of whom I even knew - had refused). However, my grandmother, my little Italian Nonna, was living with my parents, ten minutes walk away. It was, as the marketing men say, a no brainer: I asked her to move in with me.May I say that there is no more cushy or comfortable life, for a thirtysomething single male, than having your Italian grandmother living with you. Washing, cooking, cleaning, dusting, ironing, sewing - it was all done. Just so you don't get too jealous of the tempting, mouth watering delights that must have been served up to me each night, I must say that the one area in which Nonna was not all Italian was cooking: she was terrible. Well, maybe that's slightly too strong a word: her risotto and lasagne were good, but out of her two dish comfort zone, things tended to get, well, slabby: I still remember with a slight shudder the thick slices of deep fried polenta, quivering like vulcanised yellow rubber, that she served up at least once a week. But in all other respects, it was a wonderfully cushy life - and it meant I really got to know my Nonna (particularly as she had only recently moved to England).It was a glorious interlude, and one that lasted four years. But then, I got married (I sprang the proposal on my wife so completely out of the blue that she didn't have time to dodge). Nonna moved out. Wife moved in.Nonna went back to my parents, taking over many of the housekeeping duties there, while always, whatever the weather, taking a daily constitutional through the park.Then she had a stroke. A little one. Some weakness in her left arm, a limp, soon recovered from, and half an aspirin daily.It didn't work. The second stroke was a major one. Hospital, beeping machines, then relief. She would live. It was the left side again, but this time, worse. No movement in her left leg or arm, face pulled down on that side - at least, being the left side, there was no language loss. But she couldn't walk.Out of danger, they moved Nonna from the general hospital to Finchley Memorial Hospital, which was then devoted to recuperation and physiotherapy. And the physios set about her: exercise, effort, every day for five, six weeks.By the end of that time, there was a little improvement, but not that much, and we assembled to meet the doctor to hear what the plan was for her continuing treatment.There wasn't one. They'd done all they could. The first six weeks after stroke were crucial - after that window, there wouldn't be any further improvement. Nonna didn't speak English. The doctor told us to tell Nonna she would never walk again. As he got up to leave, he told us to set about arranging moving her into a nursing home. And that was it.For a year, Nonna sat in the lounge in the nursing home, watching television she didn't understand, and I'd visit her each day and talk to her - the despairing small talk of family and friends and weather that substituted for hope. According to the doctors, there wasn't any.I think it was anger, the slowly nurtured anger at helplessness and fate and God, that did it. The doctors might not want to do anything, but anything was better than this waiting room of death (the staff were lovely and caring, but that is what the place was).So what if the doctors said they wouldn't do anything. We would. We found a physiotherapist who spoke Italian, and paid for her to visit Nonna and work with her. And, you know, there was something - some small improvement. Nonna began to be able to move her left hand, and then her arm.And then the cavalry arrived, in the small, squashy shape of our first child, Theo - Nonna's great grandson.Nonna loved Theo. She brightened, she cooed, she came alive when we brought him to see her. And, when I held him, dangling, just out of reach as the physio worked on her standing and posture, Nonna pushed herself up, unthinking, focused on him and not on what she could not do, and she began, she began to stand.Nonna was going to be the first resident of the nursing home to walk out of there on her own two feet, rather than being carried out in a box.I still remember her chuckling laugh as she reached out to chaff Theo's cheek, standing and not even realising it, and wishing we had started this so much earlier.Then Nonna had a third stroke. She was reduced to a pair of wandering eyes, rolling without control, in a shell of flesh without any movement at all. She didn't walk out of the nursing home. Six months later, she went out in the box.I wish I'd read this book then, before all this happened. But it hadn't been written. Back then, the six weeks window was all there was. The brain was a hard-wired thinking machine: break it, and it stayed broke.This is the mistake of metaphor. We've learned to understand the body and the mind through our inventions: clocks and hydraulics, circuits and computers. Mechanical, fixed things. But the brain is alive; it's not caught by these metaphors. And what we see in this remarkable book is the dawning realisation among researchers and doctors that brain and body, mind and effort are all intimately, and directly, connected. Unlike an electronic circuit, the brain can find new connections, fresh ways of doing things, particularly when reinforcing the new connections with physical learning.It's an insight that some people seem uncomfortable with. A quite remarkable (in all the wrong ways) review, by Jonathan Ree, of The Brain's Way of Healing in The Guardian concludes thus: The publicity tells us that The Brain’s Way of Healing will provide new hope for millions of unlucky sufferers. Hope is a tricky commodity however, and while some of us may find it heartening, for others it could be another turn of the fatal screw. The neuroplastic revolution is part of a contemporary stampede towards the moralisation of medicine: patients are encouraged to blame themselves for their sufferings, and to think that their chances of recovery depend not on random tricks of fate, or the luck or good judgment of their doctors, but on their own willpower and moral fibre. Sick people need to be cared for, but they also have a right to be left in peace.This is the judgement that condemned Nonna after six weeks; this is the end of hope and the acceptance of the TV lounge; this is morally stupid and intellectually offensive. Why should hope and effort be placed in opposition to care and medicine? Only in the judgement of the reviewer. For myself, I wish this book had been written then. Maybe Nonna would still have left the nursing home in a box, but the stay would have been a battle, and not a defeat.Hope emerged last from Pandora's box. After all else is gone, hope remains."
2,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439410-darcia-helle,3,"The information Doidge provides on the brain's ability to heal itself, and thereby the body, is both fascinating and compelling. This flies in the face of our current mainstream view of the damage from brain injuries and certain chronic illnesses being permanent, with no hope of recovery. Our brains are far more resilient than science has, so far, understood.That being said, I have some problems with the overall structure and content. The important nuggets of information often get lost within repetitive information and long-winded stories. Consequently, I'm not sure this book will go over well with readers looking for a more science-based read. The book opens with a case study of a man with Parkinson's disease. This is quite a lengthy section, as we follow this one man throughout his life, his disease, his determination to heal himself, his setbacks, and his healing. We're given a lot of personal information, far more than necessary for me. This section has the feel of a memoir or biography, more so than a book on brain science.There is also a lengthy section on Moshe Feldenkrais. While interesting, this feels far more like a history lesson. We follow him from Nazi-occupied Paris. We learn about his work with Irene Joliot-Curie, the famous Madame Curie's daughter. We learn about Feldenkrais's work, while also learning about how the State of Israel was formed. All of this feels like it belongs in a different book. Finally, while I appreciate Doidge's enthusiasm, I'm troubled by the fact that each case cited here had near miraculous results. Were there any patients who simply did not do well, or even as well, with the treatments discussed? I do think there is important information to gain here on the brain's healing ability, making this book worth reading.*I was given a copy of this book by Penguin Group via Netgalley in exchange for my honest review.*"
3,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"From this book you learn of amazing new developments in neurology. The brain is plastic. What this means in simple terms is that we can do things to change it. Plastic means mold-able. It was previously thought that the brain directed the body, but now we learn that the body too changes the brain. Neurons that before have been classified as dead and useless are not dead. This has huge implications for treatment of:-stroke-Parkinson's disease-Alzheimer's-chronic pain-multiple sclerosis-traumatic brain injuries-osteoarthritis-premature infants-autism-dyslexia-ADD and ADHDYou follow specific people with the above health problems. Each is detailed and specific. Through these examples you lean of today’s cutting edge techniques. These people have what seem to be incurable, absolutely hopeless problems. Any adult of some age will be made uncomfortable following these individuals, regardless of the fact that their progress is utterly amazing. It isn't hard to imagine that such could happen to yourself. It is nice that the book focuses upon the most hopeful advances in our imminent future at the end of the book. It leaves you hopeful rather than depressed. Seriously, it is important to read this book so you know of alternative methods that are being developed. The methods are holistic. Treatments shy away from medicines when possible. It is interesting to see how ancient Eastern treatments are being woven into new treatments and are validated by testing. The techniques are clearly described, BUT one gets to a point where so much is thrown at you that you need to reread and absorb before you go on. I found myself following the text and even if I ""understood"", I would ask myself how exactly is that possible? The results are so astounding you step back and have a hard time believing. Even if it all makes sense. The section at the end on music therapy and the ""electronic ear device"" became diffuse in my head. Doctors’ names are clearly stated. Also where they work. More information is said to be available at the author's home page: http://www.normandoidge.com/ I plan on seeking further information. The audiobook is wonderfully narrated by George Newbern. Slowly and clearly. Even the appendices are read. They are also available as PDFs with the audiobook. However it is hard in an audiobook to backtrack to a particular chapter. Often it will be said, ""as presented in chapter X."" Going back to that is not easy. For this reason alone, I recommend the paper book. There are some absolutely wonderful things ahead to be further investigated. If you run into any of the above problems do check out this book. The next problem is finding someone who can help you. That could be difficult. This is cutting-edge technology."
4,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27267892-tim-murray,2,"This book was more disappointing than I think I can possibly convey. The Brain That Changes Itself was one of my favourite books and I have recommended it to all my friends, so I was very excited about reading the sequel. In this book Norman Doidge basically does the same as the first book, he gives examples of people with very serious illnesses who have had amazing cures. However for this book he has abandoned the scientific and fully embraced the pseudoscientific. I am certainly not an expert on anything to do with the human body but I started to get skeptical once he basically wrote that 'sunlight is good so lasers must be better'. He thens proceeds to give a list of things that low level skin laser treatment can heal and it reads exactly like the worst pseudoscientific garbage. Essentially he says it is a miracle cure for everything from depression to cancer. I was still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt so I read as many medical papers on laser treatment as I could find and they all bore out my suspicions. Laser treatment has little, if any benefit over a placebo. This then followed for every single example for the rest of the book, with the worst example being the exercises that can improve eyesight. From my research, this has been debunked for decades and can be actually damaging to your eyes! Using one miraculous cure as an example of how well a treatment works is certainly not a good scientific method.In a word, avoid."
5,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"It's not that long ago that the idea of neuroplasticity was seen as fringe fantasy, though it is now widely accepted (though like climate change, it has its sceptics).In his second book on the subject, Doidge covers several techniques that are being used to change neural pathways to manage pain, recover lost movement, reduce symptoms of Parkinson's and other conditions. One of his main messages is that the body and the mind (brain) can't be seen as separate, the two work together in infinite feedback loops (my image, not his). He wants to reach a wide audience, which no doubt accounts for the great weight of case studies over theory. If you want the theory, you have to dig for it, and follow through in the journal literature if you want more. For our book club, the balance was pretty well right, given our diverse backgrounds. Between us we were familiar with the power of focused meditation, visualisation, mindful exercise, music therapy and Feldenkrais awareness through movement techniques. None of us knew of the tongue stimulation techniques used by one practice in the US, which seems to have been very successful for those with the commitment to persist with exercises. I learned from that chapter that neck injury can affect the brain; and that repeated injury can mean you lose what you recovered and have to start rehab again. Doidge has helped me understand the dysfunctional loops of chronic pain following neck injury (I've had multiples) and I've begun to combine several of the techniques he discusses to help me manage muscle cramps, pain and improve my sleep. I've been going to Feldenkrais classes for several years; know enough to be able to focus on specific muscle groups and work on them. I now combine it with music (Mozart is recommended) and visualisation as I go to bed, and for the last two weeks I've slept better than I have for a long time. It's having other benefits as well, as I get better at managing my brain activity. Hooray! .Thank you Norman Doidge, and thank you book group for another fascinating discussion."
6,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3574699-jennifer-lane,4,"The Plastic BrainWhen I expressed interest in understanding more about the neurobiology of mental health, a psychologist friend recommended The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science. When I looked up that book, I found this more recent book by the same author, so started with this first.Did you know scientists didn't fully appreciate the plasticity of the brain until 2000? That wasn't so long ago, and we are on a steep learning curve to understand how the brain can grow and change like any other organ.I didn't have a chance to read the entire book, but the chapters I did read were fascinating:In Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself, physician Michael Moskowitz suffered from debilitating chronic pain. If you've ever had chronic pain, you know how hopeless and irritable you feel. But instead of resting and bemoaning his pain, he found a way to stop it. He learned about the brain areas that light up when damaged neurons send false alarms (as with chronic pain). Knowing ""neurons that fire together, wire together"", with chronic pain the cells in the pain system begin to fire more easily, and the pain maps enlarge their receptive field due to the damaged neurons. The more often Moskowitz felt twinges of neck pain, the more easily his brain's neurons recognized it, and the more intense it got. The name for this process is wind-up pain, because the more the receptors in the pain system fire, the more sensitive they become.Moskowitz also knew that ""neurons that fire apart wire apart"". Could he start to weaken links that had formed in his pain maps? What if, when he was in pain, he could try to override the natural tendency to retreat, lie down, rest, stop thinking, and nurse himself? The brain needed a counter-stimulation.He decided to rewire his brain by visualizing the involved brain areas shrinking every time he felt pain. By six weeks, his pain was severely diminished, and by one year, it was gone. Kewl.A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms demonstrates the magical effects of exercise on the brain. John Pepper is a South African man who reversed Parkinson's Disease through walking. There are also chapters on treating ADHD with music, blindness with eye exercises, and multiple sclerosis with a device that stimulates the tongue and therefore the brain.The writing style is engaging. Quite an interesting read!"
7,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"The Brain’s Way of Healing is the sequel to Doidge’s earlier introduction to the science of neuroplasticity, The Brain That Changes Itself. While that book took a more general look at the subject, this book hones in on the specific ways that harnessing the brain’s ability to rewire itself can result in remarkable recoveries from stroke and other traumatic brain injury, and halt or slow the progression of diseases like Parkinson’s and MS. This is some of the most exciting science of the twenty-first century, and Doidge does an amazing job of making it accessible to the average reader without dumbing it down. If you own a brain, you need to read this book.–Kate Scottfrom The Best Books We Read In September 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/10/03/riot-r..."
8,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9190123-leo,1,"Anecdotal and ignorant of scientific method. I found it hard to credit anything Doidge wrote after his random prattling about the action of laser light inside cells. This is not Oliver Sacks style ""here is an interesting case and this is what it might tell us about how things might work"" or ""here are some new developments being trialled"" it is a string of ""Bob had a brain problem, by application of X he got better!"" type stories where X varies from exercise to mindfulness to lasers.Quackery for those desperate to believe in miracle cures. Sad, because the area of brain plasticity is very interesting while cherry picked anecdotes in isolation are not."
9,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart,5,"A while ago I read and reviewed this author´s first book “The brain that changes itself” and found it fascinating. I deem the present book to be even more so.First we learn of the case of the psychiatrist/pain specialist Michael Moskowitz, who after a horrific accident, had chronic pain for 13 years, He got rid of the pain by visualizing that the areas of his brain producing it are shrinking, after discovering that two brain areas process both visual information and pain. The assumption is that these areas cannot process pain and visualize at the same time. He teaches his patients to use the same method to dissolve their chronic pain.In fact, though, I do not see that these cases prove anything, since it is known that all visualization can work, even visualization that has nothing to do with pain. It would have been interesting if the author could also have explained to us how visualization in general works.Other scientists have found that patients can “shrink” their body image to rewire their brains. When patients with chronic hand pain looked through binoculars at their hands and thus magnified them, pain was increased; when they looked through the wrong end of the binoculars so their hands looked smaller, pain decreased.A Parkinson´s patient, John Pepper, learnt how to reverse his major symptoms and walk normally by a system he devised to exercise conscious control over his walking. He formed a Parkinson´s support group and taught hundreds of other such patients to drop their shuffling gait and move more freely and effectively. After mastering walking he began to take conscious control over his tremor.A chapter on rewiring the brain with light tells us how sunlight heals babies with jaundice. Florence Nightingale exposed her patients to as much sun as possible and thereby ensured their healing.Fred Kahn was healed of a rotator cuff injury by laser treatment (as I myself was), and began using low-intensity laser treatments to heal horrific wounds, diabetic ulcers, burns, psoriasis, black, gangrenous limbs, etc. etc. ; also rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, some psychiatric disorders, nerve injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can be healed in this way.We are told how LED lights, in the red and infrared range, which have laser-like properties, were used on eight areas of the head of a woman with disabling TBI symptoms. She couldn´t concentrate or sleep, became easily exhausted, couldn´t complete tasks and had lost her ability to speak two foreign languages. After her first treatment she slept 18 hours and began improving significantly.A Boston group has found laser treatment helpful in TBI. “Laser acupuncture” was used by placing light on acupuncture points. Lasers harmlessly and painlessly pass light energy into meridians. In China lasers are used to treat paralysis in stroke patients, resulting in significant improvements.The case of Gabrielle is described; following removal of a life-threatening brain tumour she had trouble swallowing and eating, was constantly nauseous, had balance problems and difficulty walking. People could hardly hear her speak; she used the wrong words, like “fork” instead of “knife”, and couldn´t multi-task; she had lost her short-term memory, couldn´t recognize objects and could see only what was directly in front of her; she was hypersensitive to all sounds, which seemed unbearably loud; she was chronically exhausted.Fred Kahn rewired Gabrielle´s brain with light by means of his laser treatments, and she was healed.Lasers were used successfully by Kahn and others to heal other brain problems, together with cardiovascular problems.Light therapy is also being used to improve damaged connections between neurons in Alzheimer´s.There is a great chapter on the work of Moshe Feldenkrais with healing serious brain problems through mental awareness of movement.These various healers came to their discoveries through working on and mastering their own severe health problems.A baby girl missing part of her brain, a third of her cerebellum, who could neither sit up nor crawl, and whose parents were told the best they could hope for was “profound retardation” was healed by Feldenkrais´s special techniques. He pronounced that the girl would dance at her wedding. She now has two graduate degrees from major universities, is a voracious reader, and did indeed dance at her wedding.There´s a chapter entitled “A Blind Man Learns to See” about a man called Webber who lost his sight owing to uveitis, an autoimmune disease. He was healed by doing exercises recommended by Feldenkrais which were similar to four ancient Buddhist exercises and also to Bates´ techniques.Webber needed help from Feldenkrais to be cured, but the four basic techniques which helped were as follows:1)	Meditate on the colour blue-black for a few hours a day.2)	Move the eyes up, down, left and right, and around in circles, as well as on diagonals.3)	Blink frequently.4)	Sun your eyes. Sit with eyes closed in the morning or late afternoon and let the warmth and light of the sun penetrate through the eye tissues ten to twenty minutes a day.Deep relaxation of the eyes is essential.We learn about an amazing device called the PoNS that healed a singer called Ron who could no longer sing because of MS, had trouble swallowing and suffered from unrelenting exhaustion. PoNS stands for Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator. You put the device in your mouth where it painlessly stimulates the tongue and its sensory receptors “with waves of gentle signals”. After thirty years of steadily worsening symptoms Ron´s improvement was rapid and vast. All his MS symptoms improved.There are 48 different kinds of sensory receptors on the tongue and these receptors pass electrical signals to nerve fibres, then on to the brain.The PoNS device sits on the front two-thirds of the tongue. After 400-600 milliseconds brain waves are stabilized and all parts of the brain start to react, firing together. The tongue stimulation activates the whole brain. While using the device the patient at the same time does an appropriate exercise. A person with difficulty walking should try to walk, then run, on a treadmill when using the PoNS. The device resets the brain.We are provided with case histories of persons with both Parkinson´s and MS who were healed by the PoNS, together with persons severely brain injured in car accidents.We hear about Tomatis´s Electronic Ear, which helped struggling singers who were not hearing high frequencies well. Once they could hear properly, they could sing properly. Tomatis trained the brain by stimulating the ear. We are given the case history of a boy born prematurely who had severe developmental problems and who was heled by using the Electronic Ear. This listening therapy is also effective against autism.It is said that the core feature of autism is an inability “to empathize and apprehend the existence of other minds”. This is not true, however. A more precise explanation is as follows: “Battered by sound, these children remain in fight-or flight and cannot turn on the social engagement system”.This is not only an amazing, enlightening book informing us of many not generally known ways of healing all sorts of severe brain problems, but the author writes in an engaging manner, including many personal details and descriptions of the various therapists and their healed clients, so we feel we know them personally.Though this is obviously a scientific book comprising innumerable technical details, I found it to be easy to read. I would say that it is the most informative, useful and enlightening book I have read for at least a decade, and I have read many such books. I would wish that all those with brain injuries and problems could have access to one or more of the exciting treatments mentioned."

This was a great book, fascinating, learning many different ways that the brain can heal itself.A great resource book.

After hearing several of his interviews and being fascinated by their content I bought Norman Doidge's latest book. Only a few pages in I lost faith with him. Peddling false hope with dubious science and worse, encouraging irrational fears that will cause actual harm to people. So disappointing."
13,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25800231-michele,1,"The preface promises miracles... but there sure isn't a lot of primary literature cited. >_< so disappointed this seems to be a bunch of pseudoscience... I can't bring myself to read it fully after skimming the references. Naturopaths? Osteopaths? Chiropractors? Seriously?? If this book wasn't claiming to be scientifically sound, I'd be way less annoyed. Quite frankly, it's misleading people to believe a lot of these therapies are medically and scientifically sound. Doidge's first book, The Brain that Changes Itself, inspired me to study neuroscience! I'm saddened this book appears to be quackery. I might revisit it later and fact-check it chapter-by-chapter, but I definitely read enough to get a good whiff of baloney. "
14,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9988478-pam-thomas,5,"Absolutely loved the book, its about the way the brain recovers and embarks on a journey of discovery, how a brain can recover with light and awaken damaged neural circuits, how it can turn off when pain is in the body releasing endorphin's to quell pain and the role of neurons and pain through research. a very indepth and fascinating and educational book."
15,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6695185-am-y,5,"Definitely worth a read. I didn't manage to finish the last few chapters but the first few I read were very interesting and illuminating. The first case study involves the author following a man with Parkinson's and detailing his recovery process. We learn about ""laser light healing"" - a form of treatment which basically involves applying a low-level laser or light-emitting diode to the surface of the body in order to stimulate the body's cells to heal faster. The science behind this is based on the fact that the human body contains light-receptive cells throughout (and not just in our eyes, as most of us might think) - even in internal organs which never see the light of day. Below you can read more about these light-sensing cells in the human body:- https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar...- https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/h...The author details research findings by other scientists and researchers showing that when these cells are exposed to light, they are ""triggered"" into starting the healing process, thereby bringing about rapid healing. Experiments on mice showed that the control group which had not received the same targeted light exposure healed much slower, and less healing took place (measured by the size of the injury site).The author describes how several people have had success with laser light therapy, which simulates the effect of sunlight on cells by focusing a beam directly onto the subject's injury area. If the injury is on an internal organ or other internal part of the body, surgery may be required in order to allow the beam to be shone directly onto the organ itself and not just the outer (epidermal) skin covering it.Laser light therapy was effective in helping reverse cognitive decline/damage in at least 2 individuals which the book showcased. The implications of this method as a form of healing are immense, especially in diseases such as Parkinson's for which there is no known cure. I will pick this book up again in the future to see what the remaining chapters discuss."
16,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,4,"Boy, when they say ""remarkable"" they mean remarkable. I was astounded by these recovery stories based on therapies I'd never heard of before. The book is a fascinating read, and I ended up just buying it as a reference when I got near the end of it. I found a lot of information that had potential applications for myself or my loved ones. I've been hearing references to neuroplasticity for about a year now, and this is the first book I've read about it. It does get rather in-depth in spots, alternating between technical details and anecdotal examples. Science is not my strongest subject, but I was still able to follow. I have two complaints. The first one is that he kept referencing his other book The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science, which I plan to eventually read, but I didn't need to be reminded of so often. The second complaint is the animal testing that was spoken of with absolutely no empathy or apology. There has to be a better way to test a therapy than dropping a magnet on a mouse's head to simulate a brain injury, or severing a rat's spinal cord, or sewing a monkey's fingers together. That mouse one particularly, on top of being cruel, didn't even seem like it would guarantee any accuracy. I should clarify that the author wrote about this testing but wasn't the one actually performing any of these tests himself. I just didn't appreciate that it was presented so prosaically.Still a good book though, and highly recommended."
17,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,2,"I previously read The Brain that Changes Itself, and liked the writing. That book was exciting because it was presenting the “intellectual revolution” of adult brain plasticity, and the first studies utilizing this new principle were emerging. Doige likes to get personal with his stories, often spending extended periods of time with those he writes about, thus giving his books a compassionate and human feeling. This new book is a follow up in the same vein, investigating the newest and most exciting applications of adult neuroplasticity. The stories are all interesting (although in my opinion would have been far more interesting at roughly half the length) but there are a few central problems that keep this book from being one I would recommend.1.	He never even discusses the idea of a base rate. In order to evaluate any of the treatments he writes about, we need to know the expected rate of people in that population to spontaneously recover. 2.	Very little discussion of contrary evidence to his miraculous claims. In a couple of chapters he briefly discusses a criticism from a mainstream physician, only to dismiss it out of hand. Not at all a balanced book. I would describe this book as more self-help, or religion, than science. Like self-help and religion, I’m sure it’s brought hope to many people, so that’s a positive. It’s also pretty interesting, the section on laser therapy was especially intriguing as it was the one I knew the least about. But it’s dangerous in many ways to masquerade as a science book if you’re not going to follow the scientific method. I understand and agree with Doidge that mainstream science is subject to flaws and biases, but I completely disagree with him that that means we should instead put our faith in miraculous anecdotes.

A Michelin Guide to this hopeful new trove of knowledge and insight.
Boston Globe
Doidge explains the processes of the brain and body in a clear and understandable way, even to those of us who previously couldn’t distinguish a hippocampus from a hippopotamus. He tells of patients who hobble into labs and medical offices on canes and leave without them after their first visit. His enthusiasm for these recoveries is no less than that of a faith healer who has just brought sight to the blind … For someone who suffers — or knows someone who suffers — from an injury or illness related to the brain, both this book as well as Doidge’s previous will provide information — and perhaps hope — that the brain can heal itself.
Seattle Times
A dazzling collection of stories about neuroplasticity and the ever-changing brain … cutting-edge treatments that use the body's senses to access, and improve, neurological functioning. In friendly vignettes reminiscent of Oliver Sacks’ case studies, Doidge chronicles the heroic efforts of patients with a wide variety of apparently intractable ailments, from chronic pain to multiple sclerosis … Doidge truly takes a holistic approach to his subjects, getting to know them and their doctors and sharing every detail with his readers … Each of Doidge’s examples suggests tangible treatment ideas for patients who may have thought they were out of options. Doidge’s penchant for considering unconventional approaches to healing offers hope for all.
Boston Globe
Exhilarating science … In an era of ever-increasing medicalisation of the human mind, and the medication of it, the appeal of neuroplasticity outlined by Doidge is addictive. It is inspiring, page-turning stuff.

While never dumbing down the science, he’s positively elegant in his crystalline explanations of brain science for a lay audience.Marcia KAye, Toronto StarA vivid, robust and optimistic read … an essential addition to our growing understanding of the mind-brain-body connection. Doidge argues quite convincingly that when the brain is damaged or incompletely formed, whether from stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, autism, ADHD or a host of other conditions, it's entirely possible to ‘rewire’ the circuits by training a different part of the brain to take over the task … Doidge has an uncanny knack for addressing questions just as they arise in the reader's mind … An award-winning literary writer and journalist as well as a psychiatrist, Doidge has achieved a fine blend here between scientific substance and literary style. While never dumbing down the science, he's positively elegant in his crystalline explanations of brain science for a lay audience.

Reviewers hailed Norman Doidge’s 2007 The Brain That Changes Itself as a book that showed its author’s rare talent to explain science to the rest of us: “You don't have to be a brain surgeon to read it — just a person with a curious mind.” Now the physician who was then paired with Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould returns with a captivating new tome about neuroplasticity, the brain’s astonishing capacity to repair itself after injury or illness. Dr Doidge’s clear descriptions of exciting breakthrough brain research will give readers a heartening new sense of the dynamism of the body we live with daily.Barnes and NobleDoidge is the master of explaining how the brain’s plasticity can be harnessed to improve the symptoms of brain-related disorders, ranging from stroke to autism.

Doidge is persuasive and curious as a writer, and rigorous as a thinker, though what he writes about is at the edge of our current understanding of mind and body.Tim Adams, The Observer[Doidge] writes in an urgent, enthusiastic voice … He couples anecdote with science: describing patients and scientists with respect and warmth, explaining complex neuroscientific theories clearly and in great detail.

Doidge describes a whole array of mostly side edffect-free ways for the brain to experience profound healing. It took me awhile to get through this 500-page work, just because it is so full of amazing new things to think about and absorb. But now that I have finished it, I think I need to read it again. Highly recommended for anybody interested in the workings of the brain, as well as anybody suffering from Parkinson's, traumatic brain injury, symptoms of autism, and any number of other kinds of brain-related injury, disease or dysfunction. Ten stars. "

Some treatments rely on the mind/body alone, others use technology such as lasers and neuromodulation stimulators. Together such approaches represent a few of the inspiring first fruits of our current golden age of neuroscience."
25,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,4,"Deeply fascinating and important information shared in this book. I hesitate to give five stars though because sometimes the promises of healing with the therapies described really sound too good to be true particularly the chapter on light and laser therapy which makes it sound like a cure-all. Most of these therapies will probably not harm a person physically, but I am greatly concerned about the financial havoc which could be wrought. The possibilities are exciting though in what people are learning about the brain."

Some of Norman Doidge case studies seem a little flaky at first but he back everything up with science - good science! I was interested to see a fairly large section on Moshe Feldenkrais, Awareness Through Movement.

This book is a must read for anyone who recognises they are aging and wants to at least keep their brain young, anyone who is a parent or anyone who works with children with any type of learning disability affecting the brain. There is so much more hope for halting/slowing progression of degenerative diseases or for improvement of various disorders of the brain than there was even a decade ago and yet we rarely hear of it in the mainstream. Why? Because the treatments do not involve drugs and thus are not beneficial to big pharma. Of course travel and consultation fees with the few experts are probably prohibitive for many people for many of the treatments, but some such as walking cost nothing and may work so must be worth a try. Over time many of the other options may become more widespread as they are more accepted and more people are trained in their use. Here's hoping for a brighter future where children with brain disorders don't have to be drugged to concentrate at school so much and where those of us aging can at least keep our brains sharp while the body fails."

What a breath of fresh air to see a writer unafraid to delve into the fringes of medical science and explore the latest discoveries that ""science writers"" scoff at. After all, if we are to evolve we cannot limit ourselves to the box of already-discovered medicine, we need to broaden our scope and open our minds. Cosider the fact that pretty much every kind of medicine we practice was once ""pseudoscience"" and didn't have studies to back it up. Doidge is open-minded to new forms of treatment and is intelligent enough to be able to see the benefits of being daring in the quest to find healing. Celebrating the brain as the miracle organ it is he shows us how we can find ways to help ourselves when medicine shrugs us off. I have read and reread his book and bought copies for friends and family. I have bought lights and looked into studying Feldenkrais.

He presents a number of case studies of patients who have seen remissions in their serious brain injuries. These includes using things like brain stimulation through the tongue, 'cold' laser saturation of the body and holistic movement therapies like that developed by Feldenkrais.

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
32,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

46,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
47,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
48,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
49,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
50,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."

This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "

What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."

In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""

Doidge spends chapter after chapter sharing examples of neuroplasticity in action, without ever really seemingly making a point. His constant attacks on the medical establishment for not embracing it earlier come across as needlessly conspiratorial. Interesting enough but I'm more interested to see what develops in this area in the future rather than reading through a compilation of case-studies."

""Thus, when the brain has been damaged, it may, in some situations, be able to do the same task using different coalitions of neurons"" (106) . . .

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
62,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

76,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
77,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "

This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs.

In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
92,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

106,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
107,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
108,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
109,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
110,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."
111,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6306492-amy,4,"I read this book directly after finishing the Brain that Changes Itself. The first book made me feel hope for the future of medicine. This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "
112,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232279-katya,5,"Really amazing! In his book Norman Doidge outlines several remarkable achievements in the research of the neuroplasticity of brain. What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."

136,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
137,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
138,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
139,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
140,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."
141,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6306492-amy,4,"I read this book directly after finishing the Brain that Changes Itself. The first book made me feel hope for the future of medicine. This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "
142,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232279-katya,5,"Really amazing! In his book Norman Doidge outlines several remarkable achievements in the research of the neuroplasticity of brain. What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."
143,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26301671-stan-dueck,3,"A pretty good followup to the ""The Brain that Changes Itself"".I liked this from the preface (page xix) about the language of medicine: ""Medicine became a 'battle' against disease...medicine fights 'the war against cancer'...This 'armamentarium,' as physicians call their bag of therapeutic tricks, honors invasive high-tech treatments as more scientifically serious than noninvasive ones...But the metaphor creates problems too, and the very idea that it is possible to 'conquer' nature is a fond, naive hope. In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""

Doidge spends chapter after chapter sharing examples of neuroplasticity in action, without ever really seemingly making a point. His constant attacks on the medical establishment for not embracing it earlier come across as needlessly conspiratorial. Interesting enough but I'm more interested to see what develops in this area in the future rather than reading through a compilation of case-studies."

166,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
167,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
168,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
169,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
170,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."
171,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6306492-amy,4,"I read this book directly after finishing the Brain that Changes Itself. The first book made me feel hope for the future of medicine. This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "
172,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232279-katya,5,"Really amazing! In his book Norman Doidge outlines several remarkable achievements in the research of the neuroplasticity of brain. What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."
173,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26301671-stan-dueck,3,"A pretty good followup to the ""The Brain that Changes Itself"".I liked this from the preface (page xix) about the language of medicine: ""Medicine became a 'battle' against disease...medicine fights 'the war against cancer'...This 'armamentarium,' as physicians call their bag of therapeutic tricks, honors invasive high-tech treatments as more scientifically serious than noninvasive ones...But the metaphor creates problems too, and the very idea that it is possible to 'conquer' nature is a fond, naive hope. In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""
174,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"This is the second book by Norman Doidge I've read. Very informative. The author did a superb job for laying out and summarizing recent progress of medical science regarding human brain and treatment for brain malfunctions. The author's attitude towards the treatment of several medical conditions described in this book is honest, mater-of-fact, with no exaggeration or misleading. The stories are usually uplifting, excellent for someone who is looking for inspiration in life. Highly recommended!"
175,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34081016-brodie-stewart,2,"Eh.Despite being almost 400 pages long, I felt like there wasn't a lot of actual substance in the book. Doidge spends chapter after chapter sharing examples of neuroplasticity in action, without ever really seemingly making a point. His constant attacks on the medical establishment for not embracing it earlier come across as needlessly conspiratorial. Interesting enough but I'm more interested to see what develops in this area in the future rather than reading through a compilation of case-studies."
176,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787430-jo,5,"Utterly fascinating! I downloaded the audiobook from my public library and so enjoyed listening to the science and stories illustrating discoveries about neuroplasticity in recent decades. The challenges overcome by creative clinicians and patients alike in conditions ranging from Parkinson's, MS, and traumatic brain injury to chronic pain, ADD, autism and sensory disorders are astounding and moving. This is progress."

As always, Norman Doidge is an elegant writer. The way in which he recounts other's stories will grip you. I become so mesmoried by the stories he tells I sometimes forget I'm reading a non-fiction book! Nonetheless, this book is extremely informative and is a must read."
180,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6965537-james,4,"I think that seeing the healing brain at work is fascinating: chronic pain, Parkinson's, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, autism, attention deficits, sensory processing disorder, TBI, and anxiety. For additional information, go to Chapter 3: The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing: How and Why it Works. ""Thus, when the brain has been damaged, it may, in some situations, be able to do the same task using different coalitions of neurons"" (106) . . . ""as learning occurs, new connections are formed between neurons"" (107).  ""When musicians jam, their dominant brain waves begin to entrain with one another"" (346); chanting as well as Mozart's music are similarly useful for grooving brain waves. "
181,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15643997-jason-scott,2,"Audiobook.I love it for given the counter to ""the neurons that fire together, wire together"" with ""the neurons that fire apart, wire apart"". I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."

Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."

I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
198,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
199,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
200,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."
201,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6306492-amy,4,"I read this book directly after finishing the Brain that Changes Itself. The first book made me feel hope for the future of medicine. This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "
202,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232279-katya,5,"Really amazing! In his book Norman Doidge outlines several remarkable achievements in the research of the neuroplasticity of brain. What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."
203,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26301671-stan-dueck,3,"A pretty good followup to the ""The Brain that Changes Itself"".I liked this from the preface (page xix) about the language of medicine: ""Medicine became a 'battle' against disease...medicine fights 'the war against cancer'...This 'armamentarium,' as physicians call their bag of therapeutic tricks, honors invasive high-tech treatments as more scientifically serious than noninvasive ones...But the metaphor creates problems too, and the very idea that it is possible to 'conquer' nature is a fond, naive hope. In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""
204,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"This is the second book by Norman Doidge I've read. Very informative. The author did a superb job for laying out and summarizing recent progress of medical science regarding human brain and treatment for brain malfunctions. The author's attitude towards the treatment of several medical conditions described in this book is honest, mater-of-fact, with no exaggeration or misleading. The stories are usually uplifting, excellent for someone who is looking for inspiration in life. Highly recommended!"

Doidge spends chapter after chapter sharing examples of neuroplasticity in action, without ever really seemingly making a point. His constant attacks on the medical establishment for not embracing it earlier come across as needlessly conspiratorial. Interesting enough but I'm more interested to see what develops in this area in the future rather than reading through a compilation of case-studies."

I downloaded the audiobook from my public library and so enjoyed listening to the science and stories illustrating discoveries about neuroplasticity in recent decades. The challenges overcome by creative clinicians and patients alike in conditions ranging from Parkinson's, MS, and traumatic brain injury to chronic pain, ADD, autism and sensory disorders are astounding and moving. This is progress."

As always, Norman Doidge is an elegant writer. The way in which he recounts other's stories will grip you. I become so mesmoried by the stories he tells I sometimes forget I'm reading a non-fiction book! Nonetheless, this book is extremely informative and is a must read."

For additional information, go to Chapter 3: The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing: How and Why it Works. ""Thus, when the brain has been damaged, it may, in some situations, be able to do the same task using different coalitions of neurons"" (106) . . . ""as learning occurs, new connections are formed between neurons"" (107).  ""When musicians jam, their dominant brain waves begin to entrain with one another"" (346); chanting as well as Mozart's music are similarly useful for grooving brain waves. "
211,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15643997-jason-scott,2,"Audiobook.I love it for given the counter to ""the neurons that fire together, wire together"" with ""the neurons that fire apart, wire apart"". I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
212,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
229,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
230,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."

This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation. Only time will tell whether the techniques discussed in the book will ever become mainstream. "

What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."

In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""

Doidge spends chapter after chapter sharing examples of neuroplasticity in action, without ever really seemingly making a point.

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
242,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

256,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
257,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "

This book, in contrast, made me feel upset that the techniques discussed in the book are not more widely available, even though some have been around for a while. Googling many of these alternative methods tells one very quickly that they are much too expensive for the average person and that insurance will not be covering them. It made me wonder whether Doidge is incorrect in some of the assertions he makes or whether the powers that be do not want to deal with the expense of bringing the ideas to the masses. I also wondered if he could be exaggerating or possibly only representing one side of things. This thought disappointed me because what I enjoyed so much about the first book was it's solid scientific foundation.

What would happen if the patient stopped being a passive figure to whom things are done, and became an active part of the cure process? What would happen if we stopped relying solely on chemical remedies and tried to train our brain instead, as if it were a broken limb we are rehabilitating? The answer - no matter how fantastic it is - is that the body often would start healing itself. The author offers descriptions of fantastic devices (from cold lasers to PoNS) and the methods amplifying the brain’s ability to heal itself (such as, for example the methods of Feldenkrais and Dr. Tomatis ). Indeed there is nothing our brain is not capable of doing, provided we do not sit on our behinds waiting to be cured, but use our most precious and powerful organ - brain - to turn us into better selves."

In this metaphor, the patient's body is less an ally than the battlefield, and the patient is rendered passive, a helpless bystander, as he watches the confrontation that will determine his fate between the two great antagonists, the doctor and the disease."""

I'm heartened by the premise that mental pathways in your brain can be actively changed. That was one of the reasons I enjoyed The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness was because of it's model that you have to get your brain out of the ruts that have been built up through conscious monitoring.Unfortunately this is one of those books that has a premise and seeks anecdotes and new discoveries that support it's premise. In the afterward to How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence Michael Pollan gives a warning about the initial reports of new treatments and ties it to the placebo effect.I already buy in to the premise that the mind is malleable and we can choose how we think and with the correct tools can change our patterns. I enjoyed the beginning that talked about chronic inflammation and chronic pain. I kind of wish that had been the entire focus of the book and I was disappointed when it moved into new subjects. The sections on Parkinsons and light therapy were good but the audiobook expired from the library after that and I don't think I'll pick it up again.One interesting thing I want to learn more about is the Feldenkrais pain management technique. This is probably the 4th neuroscience book in a row I've read and the most disappointing. I jumped back to finish ""How to Change Your Mind"" after this and it was such a more balanced book.“Moskowitz defined chronic pain as “learned pain.” Chronic pain not only indicates illness; it is itself an illness. The body’s alarm system is stuck in the “on” position, because the person has been unable to remedy the cause of an acute pain, and the central nervous system has become damaged.” “Reduce the effort whenever possible. The use of force is the opposite of awareness; learning does not take place when we are straining. The principle should not be no pain, no gain. Rather, it should be if strain, no gain. Feldenkrais thought the use of willpower (of which he obviously had plenty) was not helpful in developing awareness.” “So many modern diseases, including heart disease, depression, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and all the autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), occur in part because our body’s immune systems produce excess chronic inflammation. In chronic inflammation, the immune system stays on too long and may even begin to attack the body’s own tissues, as though they were outside invaders. The causes of chronic inflammation are many, including diet and, of course, the countless chemical toxins that become embedded in the body. Chronically inflamed bodies produce chemicals, called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to pain and inflammation.” “To my mind, every emergency room should have a low-intensity laser for people with stroke or head trauma. This therapy would be especially important for head injuries, because there is no effective drug therapy for traumatic brain injury. Uri Oron has also shown that low-intensity laser light can reduce scar formation in animals that have had heart attacks; perhaps lasers should be used in emergency rooms for cardiac” “As he analyzed the areas that fire in chronic pain, he observed that many of those areas also process thoughts, sensations, images, memories, movements, emotions, and beliefs—when they are not processing pain. That observation explained why, when we are in pain, we can’t concentrate or think well; why we have sensory problems and often can’t tolerate certain sounds or light; why we can’t move more gracefully; and why we can’t control our emotions very well and become irritable and have emotional outbursts. The areas that regulate these activities have been hijacked to process the pain signal.” “Wall and Melzack showed how a chronic injury not only makes the cells in the pain system fire more easily but can also cause our pain maps to enlarge their “receptive field” (the area of the body’s surface that they map for), so that we begin to feel pain over a larger area of our body’s surface. This was happening to Moskowitz, whose neck pain was spreading to both sides of his neck. Wall and Melzack also showed that as maps enlarge, pain signals in one map can “spill” into adjacent pain maps. Then we may develop referred pain, when we are hurt in one body part but feel the pain in another, some distance away.” “Serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter, is known to be low in some depressions; studies show that normal sunlight causes the body to release serotonin, which is one reason people living far from the equator feel rejuvenated and in a good mood on sunny holidays. Laser light also releases serotonin, as well as other important brain chemicals, such as endorphins, which lower pain, and acetylcholine, which is essential for learning—and which might help an injured brain relearn mental abilities that have been lost.""Read by one of my fav narrators, George Newbern."
272,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah,3,I wanted to see what the medical field had to say about this book. As I guessed: crickets. This book is on the wonky side with dozens of miraculous recoveries but little discussion on the details. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that it opens the door for noninvasive techniques to approach body issues. Obviously our current medical system of slicing and doping has not been perfected. I think there is room for both methods.

286,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310752-thomas-holbrook,4,"	Neuroplasticity is one of the leading edges of understanding how the body heals. Using movement, sound, light, environmental changes to create new “neuro-pathways” (developing new ways for the brain to function) that are healing sounds like science fiction and “too good to be true,” but the research is solid and the outcomes are amazing. I bought this book hoping it would have more information pertaining to how to apply these methods to the “common” mental ailments (depression and anxiety) and that information is to be found by reading the titles noted in the extensive bibliography. There was anecdotal information of how these methods address these, along with many others, issues but the majority of this work is given, as the title indicates, stories of how neuroplasticity is changing how we are thinking about healing.	Dr. Doidge, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, has traveled extensively in researching how the new discoveries in neuroplasticity are helping people once feared irrevocably impaired due to injury, disease, birth defect, etc. Many of the stories he cites are extensive to the point of my feeling he was over-stating his case. Each of the eight chapters focuses on a different method found to be effective in creating new neuropathways. Chapter One addresses the ability and power of unlearning (not re-educating) what one does and how one perceives certain aspects of disease and illness, specifically those traits dealing with chronic pain. Chapter Two highlights the benefits of exercise as it strengthens more muscles than those found below the neck. Chapter Three gives background and some research as to the “how” and “why” Neuroplastic treatment works. Chapter Four, the chapter I found to be most fascinating, deals with how light heals. The content regarding “cold” lasers was enough to give me goosebumps. Chapter Five is a biography of Moshe Feldendrais, a physicist turned Kineticist whose understanding of how the brain is connected to movement has, literally, brought people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches without invasive interventions. Chapter Six expands Feldenkrais’ developments and pairs it with Mindfulness and other “awareness” training of the brain. Chapter Seven explores how the brain “resets” itself with stories of those who have succeeded in reversing symptoms of progressive disease or catastrophic injury of the brain. The final chapter, Eight, delves into the power of sound in healing the brain.	As a therapist, the stories related in this book are encouraging and exciting. To read of resolution to dysfunctions and injuries once thought to be so severe that the best that one could hope for is acceptance and learning coping skills to address the deficiencies caused by those instances is cause for further research and a glimpse of hope. I kept reminding myself, when the stories were sounding too good to be real, particularly learning they had been wrought using only light, sound, movement, etc., that the idea that bread mold could heal infection once sounded just as incredible.As a theologian, reading a book written by a scientist citing solid science to discuss how the body can do more than we have come to think possible, puts me in mind of the Psalmist when he wrote, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. . . . I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps 139).” Perhaps our remembering that all we “know” is all there is will keep us all searching for further true things."
287,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I do have to emphasize that I enjoyed it for its exploration of FRONTIERS in neuroplasticity as a subarea of neuroscience. Many other reviewers are angry that the book seems to promise bonafide cures for a host of common (and some uncommon ailments). I'm not reading this book looking for a cure; I'm watching a new scientific field developing, and I find the unfolding of new knowledge fascinating. It's the meta-level reading rather than the fact finding that intrigues me. I feel as though ""the jury is still out"" because large-scale randomized studies still need to be conducted. Doidge doesn't present the results of large data sets. He presents case studies that invite larger study. (Some chapters do actually mention the launching of such studies at present.) We live in an era where neuroplasticity is extremely young. The word itself appeared in the 1970s and didn't show up more broadly in print until the 21st Century. What scientists know about the brain's malleability is a wobbly toddler just learning to walk. The book for me points more towards possibility more than it affirms absolute fact. Accepting the ""frontier"" part of the subtitle made this an interesting read. Here are short summaries of the chapters:Ch. 1 ""Physician Hurt, Then Heal Thyself: Michael Moskowitz Discovers that Chronic Pain Can Be Unlearned.""Doidge gives a fascinating account of how pain is actually located in the brain, and how people can work with their body concept and pain perception in ways that addresses chronic pain. Ch. 2 ""A Man Walks Off His Parkinsonian Symptoms: How Exercise Help Fend Off Degenerative Disorders and Can Defer Dementia.""By using his frontal cortex to retrain himself on how to walk, John Pepper (a banker / computer programmer) relearns how to walk, despite his PD.Ch. 3 ""The Stages of Neuroplastic Healing""This is a very small chapter that provides key concepts and an overview for subsequent chapters. Ch. 4 ""Rewiring the Brain with Light: Using Light to Reawaken Dormant Neural Circuit.""The use of lasers can help overcome a variety of physical ailments, including problems with the brain. Ch. 5 ""Moshe Feldenkrais: Physicist, Black Belt, and Healer: Healing Serious Brain Problems Through Mental Awareness of Movement"" By using micromovements and energy theory, Feldenkrais, a physicist-turned-Judo-instructor, heals himself and then heals others. Ch. 6 ""A Blind Man Learns to See."" David Webber becomes legally blind due to disease and complications of treatments. He learns about various eye exercises and even hand and body exercises that help him rebuild his vision through cognitive restructuring. Ch. 7 ""A Device that Resets the Brain."" A research lab at UW-Madison has used a device called PoNS that sends electrical current on the tongue. Read about four participants with a variety of ailments--TBI, MS, PD--who regained functions. Ch. 8 ""A Bridge of Sound."" Paul Madaule extends the healing properties of technically manipulated sounds as first used by his physician-turned-mentor Alfred Tomitas. The methods of reorganizing the subcortial brain through a device called the Electronic Ear helped patients with developmental delays, social disorders, depression, autism and ADHD. The chapter explains a little bit about the power of Gregorian chants, Mozart and other types of music to heal the mind, body and spirit. "
288,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161667-gina,5,"In his new book, Norman Doidge describes the role of brain plasticity in healing. This paradigm is helping us recognize how improvement from symptoms of all kinds is not only possible, but explainable, as well as reproducible.Doidge artfully draws us in with people's stories, including the experiences of Dr. Michael Moskowitz, a chronic pain specialist who figured out a way to cure his own increasingly debilitating chronic pain after 13 years (chapter 1). He has also successfully taught the technique to some of his patients. In chapter 2, Doidge walks with John Pepper, a World War II survivor with Parkinson's disease who devised a program that enabled him to recover lost mobility and other functions. Pepper uses his approach not only to keep many of his symptoms at bay decades after diagnosis, he has also taught it to others with Parkinson's, who have also improved. More amazing stories and treatment approaches follow in each chapter and the case studies highlight this new paradigm. The research starts to explain the ever-elusive, until now, ""why.""In easy-to-read connecting language Doidge gives us a framework for understanding what is happening during these transformations. He, and the studies he cites throughout, take us beyond our current understanding of the brain.Doidge presents 4 stages of neuro-plastic healing, which gives us new ways of understanding how recovery occurs. Neuro-stimulation (1) is commonly needed and can occur through attention to internal processes (such as mindful attention to sensations and movement, and intentional focusing of the mind on specific tasks) as well as through external input (such as from sound, light, and vibration). The energy provided by neuro-stimulation enables the brain to repair communication pathways and regain its innate capacity to regulate or ""modulate"" itself. The modulated brain (2) regains its ability to cycle, alternating from periods of activity to periods of rest and repair. Modulation allows the brain to relax, rest and heal (3). A rested brain is able to learn and rewire (4). Learning new skills allows a person to restore old functions or develop new ones and is a process referred to as neuro-differentiation.Extremely interesting knowledge!"
289,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47112281-shaina-skaletski,4," The Brain’s way of Healing, by Norman Doidge informs the reader of remarkable discoveries and recoveries in the study and practice of neuroplasticity. The book talks about modern situations where people heal themselves using their mind on a subconscious level. Doidge also speaks to the reader on how they could potentially help themselves out with the given information. In example, the first chapter tells of a man who severely dislocated his leg resulting in a true ten out of ten of the pain scale. After using drugs and injections, the man did research on the connections of the nervous system and found a way to make block off the sensation of pain caused by his brain. Information is then given on how this was done and the different parts and functions of the brain. I really enjoyed this book because it focuses on a topic that I have a lot of interest, which is the brain and the body-brain correlation. I also enjoyed how information was given at the end of each story to explain how and why the scenario was possible. Something I didn't like was that the stories of experiences were very long and dragged out with information that didn't necessarily have to do with neuroplasticity. I think anyone that, like myself, is interested in the brain and how it relates to everyday issues would really enjoy this book. "
290,067002550X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,2,"This book starts out well enough, but as the chapters go on, the author seems to rely on anecdotes rather than evidence. By the end it devolves into outright hagiographies of Moshe Feldenkrais and Alfred Tomatis, complete with listings of miracles. Based on the strength of Doidge's first book, ""The Brain That Changes Itself"", which I've seen cited in much other popular science writing, I was inclined to believe Doidge even when some of his assertions began to seem a bit outlandish and the footnotes started becoming sparse. After being swept away for a bit by the wonder of it all, the worshipful tone has me starting to hear quacking noises, which led me to look up Tomatis's results in outside sources. The ""science"" of the Tomatis method made me reevaluate all the evidence presented in the book, which turned out to be very shaky in several parts.Doidge is an engaging writer, but apparently his background in psychiatry leaves him ill-equiped to evaluate medical evidence outside of his field. I remember enjoying his first book, but now I feel I need to go back and double-check his footnotes as I may have been taken in then as well."

In this book you will be introduced to many avenues of science and healing that you were probably not aware of. I have had plenty of reading material added to my list inspired from this book. As always, Norman Doidge is an elegant writer. The way in which he recounts other's stories will grip you. I become so mesmoried by the stories he tells I sometimes forget I'm reading a non-fiction book! Nonetheless, this book is extremely informative and is a must read."
