0,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,2,"Descriptive but not very practical--The main and only thesis of the book is: emotional intelligence is important. That's it. Goleman spends over 13 hours in this audiobook to pretty much buttress the thesis with evidence from various sources including psychology, medicine, and educational programs.The content is interesting at times but overall, the message got repetitive and I was looking for any useful information to put to use in my daily life from the book to no avail. Unfortunately the book is very much descriptive and normative, but not very useful or practical. He describes what emotional intelligence is and makes a strong case for its importance over IQ, but fails to make it relevant to daily life.Also, the content is not as groundbreaking as it used to be due to the recent proliferation of studies, research, and books on the subject (which could be precisely because of this book, but I plead insufficient knowledge on this matter).So overall, I thought it was too long and not very practical, but there were still some interesting facts.

1,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089478-jim,5,"This visionary book by Daniel Goleman is one of the most important in my collection. I see it as a seminal contribution to understanding the human condition, and a roadmap of practical steps for living better, both within ourselves and with those around us.I begin by recommending the excellent review by Lars - a clear, well-written summary of the major points in the book.Here I will focus on 3 topics from the book: 1) the evolution of brain mechanisms for emotional and rational behavior; 2) how these mechanisms can be hijacked in modern life, both accidentally and intentionally; and 3) the critical need for properly balancing emotion and rational thought in ourselves and our society. The latter challenge has given rise to extremely important research and training endeavors, and I believe these will become even more important in the foreseeable future. I see these endeavors as promising and significant career paths for those who pursue them.For more information on the brain systems discussed below, McGill University has an excellent web site, with helpful graphics, background and discussion at three levels of complexity, starting with the basics. The links below are to this site.Brain evolutionTo understand Goleman’s message, it is important to consider the human brain as an evolutionary sequence. We can think of it as a layer cake, assembled one layer at a time. The important point is that each layer in the sequence was originally the 'executive' in a functioning brain, with no obvious need for a higher layer. We can think about this sequence by considering a frog, a ‘primitive’ mammal such as a mouse, and a human.The most obvious difference among these three brains is the relative amount of cerebral (neo)cortex. The frog has essentially none - just a small bulge called ‘cerebrum’. The major portion of this ‘reptilian brain’ closely resembles the brainstem in humans, where vital body functions such as heart rate and respiration are controlled, plus a cerebellum for fine motor control. The mouse has a relatively well-developed limbic system (discussed below) and a respectable neocortex. But the human brain is completely dominated by the massively overgrown neocortex, which must be intricately lobed and folded to fit within the skull.So what does all that neocortex do in humans? Put simply, it thinks. It makes associations, provides context, and makes decisions to guide behavior in a complex world. Most other parts of the brain carry out simple sensory processing or stereotyped motor programs, or convey information from periphery to cortex or vice versa. Cortex takes crudely processed inputs (mostly from the thalamus) and identifies salient features (speech, faces, odors). By analyzing these features, it provides a rich context for making informed decisions and choosing appropriate actions.Well, don’t frogs need a lot of cortex to process information and make adaptive decisions? Actually, they don’t. They have gotten along just fine without it for many millions of years. The tradeoff is that they can only perform a limited analysis of sensory inputs, and produce a limited and stereotyped array of behaviors. Mice, with a significant amount of cortex, can perform more sophisticated processing and behaviors, and can show some behavioral adaptation (learning). Now here is the really important part. Humans did not lose or replace the amphibian or ‘primitive’ mammalian brain. Basically, they just added really elaborate processing layers (neocortex) on top of them. All of that cortical hardware has to work through lower centers that are, for the most part, quite similar to those found in other vertebrates.A neurologist colleague elegantly summarized this concept for the medical students I was teaching, in a review session for our neuroanatomy lab exam. He pointed to a structure in the human brainstem that assists in fine-tuning motor control (inferior olive). He said, “this structure evolved to help a frog catch a fly by jumping accurately toward the target. We have to use it to do things like play piano and tap-dance. It takes a lot of cortical machinery to get that kind of performance from those cells.”It isn’t quite that simple (of course), but the analogy is a very good one. And this key concept is at the core of Goleman’s magnificent book.Good amygdala, bad amygdalaWith this evolutionary framework in place, we can consider the relative role of the limbic system (‘emotional brain’), which first emerged in early mammals. One of its key components, the amygdala, is a sort of emotional activation zone for the brain. One of its critical functions is to serve as an early-warning system for danger, such as approaching predators, and trigger very rapid fight-or-flight (sympathetic) responses. It gets direct, but crude visual and auditory inputs and processes them more quickly than neocortex. In effect, a portion of the amygdala sits and asks, ‘should I panic? should I panic?’, like an endless loop in software. These responses are, of course, extremely useful when there is real danger.The difficulty is that, in the ‘civilized’ and complex world of humans, the amygdala can generate many false alarms. Even worse, in extreme situations it can take preemptive control of behavior, and trigger blind rage, panic, or other destructive responses. In those cases, the overgrown neocortex that underlies unique human behavior is left out of the loop. And this is where the trouble starts. By analogy, neocortex is the executive who normally runs the company, but the workers can rebel and take over the production line. Examples from everyday life: I blew up; I don’t know what came over me; I just lost my head. Actually, your amygdala came over you and shut down your neocortex.Truth or consequencesBeing emotionally intelligent, in Dan Goleman’s brilliant synthesis, means that you understand the destructive potential of emotions, and actively find ways to minimize or eliminate the destruction. To do this, you must put a neocortical wisdom about emotions at the front end of your own thought process – an executive in the chain of command. The job of this executive is to find constructive ways to channel and control both your emotions and those of others. This idea is consistent with the notions of mindful meditation and the best of religious thought. In other words, it is a prescription for a long-term, sustainable vision of human existence. To me, this is the most profound element of Dan Goleman’s vision.Sounds pretty simple, right? So why is it so difficult for so many people? One big reason is that a great deal of money can be made by encouraging precisely the opposite response. Firing up the limbic system to spew out fear, outrage and hate is good for business. Movie and TV producers (and writers) may not know the difference between the limbic system and limbo, but they are experts at fueling emotional responses for profit. In stark contrast, calm, rational appeals to the better angels of our nature face a steep, uphill climb. Fear and loathing are much easier to induce, and much more marketable. Those with emotional wisdom understand that, except in the most extreme cases, fire cannot be fought with fire. But they must also understand that it is easier to start a fire and fan the flames than to put it out.Moving forwardTo me, a central challenge of our times is to find an adaptive balance between rational and emotional responses in our lives and culture. To do this, we must put the reasoning cortex in charge of our thoughts and decisions – guided but not overwhelmed by emotions. Fail to find this balance, and disaster will follow. This point is stressed by the following quote from the book:“Each day’s news comes to us rife with reports of the disintegration of civility and safety, an onslaught of mean-spirited impulse running amok. But the news simply reflects back to us on a larger scale a creeping sense of emotions out of control in our own lives and in those of the people around us. No one is insulated from this erratic tide of outburst and regret; it reaches into all of our lives in one way or another.”How can these stark realities be reconciled with the urgent need for rational policy decisions, in a world that hovers on the edge of economic and environmental disaster? Another quote:“This book is a guide to making sense of the senselessness… I have been struck by two opposing trends, one portraying a growing calamity in our shared emotional life, the other offering some hopeful remedies.”Only by building on those hopeful remedies can we take positive steps with a definite plan. This is big, important work, and visionary thinkers like Daniel Goleman are pointing the way to constructive steps that can be taken, both now and in the future."

The course was taught by a middle aged white woman from southern-Africa. She also recommend Covey's book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, but in my enthusiasm that didn't put me off from reading this, perhaps because of an exercise she conducted with us in which you think of something that you'd like to do but haven't done and then trace back the reasons why you have not done this thing until you get down to fear. This resonated with me (view spoiler)[ although I could not get this to work when I tried it on someone else! (hide spoiler)].Anyroad, thenabouts I read Emotional Intelligence in a double edition with Working with Emotional Intelligence. I lent that volume to a colleague and never got it back, I got a second copy which I lent to my Mother and I never got that back either (view spoiler)[ along with The Way of all Flesh and The Innocent Anthropologist, however since I have also permanently borrowed Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder from her I suppose there is some wider need for a truth and book reconciliation process, or communal book ownership, or maybe a tender hearted acceptance that books can never be truly owned but have a deep need instead to be free to find readers (hide spoiler)]. Finally in recent times I fell across a copy of Emotional Intelligence. The volume was in a bad way, browned and battered. More ready to prop up a wobbly table leg than to be read. The plus side of a book in this condition is that when you stand on a station platform reading in the mizzle as it pizzles down from December skies you accept this as part of the natural life cycle of a book. First treasured, finally read in all weathers and abandoned on a train.Rereading this was a curious experience. I suppose I had absorbed so much from my first reading that reading it again much of what it said seemed self-evident. Plainly my appreciation of the role of emotion in thought had changed so much I could no longer understand and value the book as I did as a first time reader, although I still enjoyed the anecdote about a drunk on a Japanese metro train(view spoiler)[ An American(view spoiler)[ sorry, but of course it almost always is, even though there are not really that many of them (hide spoiler)]who is studying martial arts, on the metro notices an obnoxious drunk coming down the carriage, he steels himself planning how to hit the drunk to disable him rapidly, just as he is ready to strike an elderly Japanese man pops up crying 'oh hello friend, sit down by me' & engages the drunk in conversation, whereupon the drunk soon bursts into tears, no violence required. There's perhaps a parable here about US foreign policy but Goleman is too modest too suggest that  (hide spoiler)] .You know how water trickles down through limestone in curious courses and cunning people in search of wisdom pour in coloured water to record how long it takes to flow out – there is something of that in rereading this book. It was first published in 1995 and while some ideas have flowed out in to the wider culture others are still percolating through- Jon Cabot Zinn and his Mindfulness programme are referred to here while we only had a flurry of related articles in the UK press and news over the last eighteen months or so, sometimes the cultural currents take very circuitous routes indeed.Alternatively I could see this book as a Matrushka. Nestled within it the next generations of popular science books, the Malcolm Gladwell one about needing to accomplish 10,000 hours of practice in a given field, Csikszentmihalyi's one on Flow, and doubtless others I didn't recognise.I would recommend it to those who were in the same position as myself some years ago, not bent backed and round shouldered, but schooled in thinking in terms of rational decision making which didn't seem adequate when looking at the surrounding office let alone the wider world, as a first primer in to the hows and implications of emotion in thought from families to workplaces. And as a corrective this is important when one happens to live in a country with elections, jury trials, and a market economy. The assumption of rationality sits alongside explicit attempts to tap into our emotional responses (view spoiler)[advertising, many news stories, films, dramas, politics (hide spoiler)]. Tuning into our emotions, Goleman argues, is the first step in avoiding being entirely driven by them.In terms of history, culture, society, all those big things and what is needed to bring abut change this book reminds me again of water percolating down through limestone. Things take their own time, where and when they emerge is not something that can be known in advance. Looking over this book again it strikes me how twenty years is barely a blink of an eye when it comes to changing fundamental mental models."
3,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,4,"After several years of looking at this seminal work on my to-read list, I am happy to have finally read it. It should be on the to-read list of educators and parents. To learn and to grow, children first need to be ready to learn and to grow. However, how and what we need to learn today can differ significantly from the requirements of our ancestors. Evolution equipped us with an early warning system, the limbic system of our brains and its marvelous filter, the amygdala. This system connects sensory perception to emotional reactions based on experiences encountered in environments where survival depended on immediate and intense responses--fight or flight. When you are hunting a woolly mammoth or being hunted by a saber-toothed tiger, careful analysis can be less helpful than a rush of adrenaline-filled momentum. Fortunately, evolution has also met more modern-day needs. The limbic core of our brains is surrounded by the neo-cortex. The front part of this add-on to human brains, which continues to grow after birth, is larger than in other animals, and highly malleable. The way this area develops is the key to emotional intelligence.The proficiency with which we identify and deal with the emotions engendered in the limbic system is the measure of how well we can avoid becoming victims of what Goleman terms 'emotional hijacking.' It would be futile to try to suppress these emotions entirely, he tells us, but success or failure in monitoring and controlling them is the yardstick of emotional intelligence.Genetics, Goleman believes, do play a part here. The very outlooks with which we are born, optimistic or pessimistic, indicate obvious propensities for high or low emotional intelligence. The incredible plasticity of our brains, though, means we are not prisoners of nature. If we consciously develop those neural pathways to the parts of our brains associated with attending to emotions, we can strengthen a 'self-aware' style of managing them that Goleman notes is so much more effective than what he calls 'engulfed' and 'accepting' styles. While recent studies have indicated the remarkable adaptability of the brain into old age, it is during childhood and adolescence, Goleman notes, where we have the largest 'windows of opportunity.' Since 'Emotional Intelligence' first came out fifteen years ago, 'emotional literacy' has earned a place in the curriculum of many schools. Reading the book strengthened my desire for a continuation of this trend. Without emotional intelligence, we are susceptible to 'flooding' where an emotional response such as anger generates more anger. Goleman's description of the biology here is fascinating. Anger is amplified as our brains release catecholamines, neurotransmitters that keep the nervous system ramped up and raring to go.When children are 'flooded,' they can not be good students. 'A child's readiness for school,' Goleman writes, 'depends on the most basic of all knowledge, how to learn.' He goes on to list important attributes of that readiness from a report by the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs: confidence, curiosity, intentionality, self-control, relatedness, capacity to communicate, and cooperativeness. 'Emotional Intelligence' is not only a manual for childhood education. Reading it really made me think about my own style of managing my own emotions. In particular, two observations by Goleman really resonated with me. One is that men, it appears, generally have a lower threshold for 'flooding' than women. If that seems counter-intuitive, it's because men often use withdrawal--stonewalling--as a way of dealing with flooding, rather than the self-expression we stereotypically associate with femininity.The second is Goleman's consideration of substance abuse as self-medication. People who are prone to addiction may actually be searching for control of depression, anxiety or rage.The importance of 'Emotional Intelligence' is apparent in the many references made to it in popular culture. It is also an accessible and entertaining book that deserves a place on the shelves of those concerned with learning and the brain. "

Reading it is like hacking your way through a dense jungle with a dull machete. It must also be noted that it is most definitely of the school of 80's/90's ""hard-wired"" thinking about the brain, and hard-sells the view that, to put it simply, mind comes from brain, and not the other way around. In other words, nature, not nurture. (For comparison, try Sharon Begley's Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain, which, oddly enough, has a preface by Goleman.) A further note: I get the distinct impression that Goleman doesn't really like people that don't ""fit in"". There is little sympathy or compassion for anyone who is a little ""different"", or not accepted by their peers, and there's a negative tone directed toward social outcasts in general, even those who happen to be children (Sample subheading from the book: ""The Making Of A Social Incompetent"").

What this book is about:The apostleship of the book is twofold, Firstly it is to convince you that EQ matters far more than IQ in achieving high levels of success and it does it perfectly through providing N+1 lengthy repetitive case studies.Second, it provides an almost accurate introduction to what EQ is, what elements contribute to a high EQ and finally what the consequences of strength and weakness in each element would bePros of the book are as follows:1. It fulfils its apostleship very well and by having it finished, (given that you might be hopeless regarding the possibility of one day becoming a highly successful figure) you will be motivated to cultivate your emotional skills.Cons of the book are as follows:1. In explaining each aspect of the EQ and results of weakness and strength in that attribute, the book is tooooooooooooo lengthy and repetitive. 2. The book is by no means practical and provides merely an overview of what can be done to obviate the weaknesses. Here are some selections of insightful parts of the book:All emotions are, in essence, to act, the instant plans for handling life that evolution has instilled in us. ---When you are under stress, you are functioning on lower, primitive part of your brain while your higher part of the brain (neocortex)which is your rational, conscious thinking mechanism, goes offline, that's why under stress people cannot think stress or even remember simple facts---At best, IQ contributes about 20 percent to the factors that determine life success which leaves 80 percent to other factors, namely, emotional intelligence, abilities such as: self-motivation, impulse control and delaying gratification, regulating one's mood etc.---We often have little or no control over when we are swept by emotion, nor over what emotion it will be.But we can have some say in how long an emotion will last.---The more we ruminate about what has made us angry, the more ""good reasons"" and self-justifications for being angry we can invent. Brooding fuels anger's flames. But seeing things differently douses those flames---Distraction is one of the most potent mood-altering devices---Being worry psychologically gives us the illusion of being in control and prepared for potential dangers (while none actually exists).---Saddness can be good: Sadness that a loss brings, closes down our interest in diversions and pleasures, fixes our attention on what has been lost, and saps our energy for starting new endeavours.---Thoughts are associated in the mind not just by content but by mood. Depressed people hence, jump from one depressing thought to another. Distraction would be a potent remedy.---Good moods while they last, enhance the ability to think flexibly and with more complexity, thus making it easier to find solutions to problems, whether intellectual or interpersonal. ---Optimism and hope, like helplessness and despair, can be learned.---You learn at your best when you have something your care about and you can get pleasure from being engaged in."
6,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/527688-tina,5,I read this book after a big break up and it really opened my eyes to how I contributed to that break up. It's extremely important to have emotional intelligence and this is a fascinating discussion behind the theory and science of EI.
7,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970762-jim,2,"There are some interesting things in the book, things that are hard to disagree with, such as emotional skills and self-knowledge are important. I think a lot of people who liked this book focused on that self-help aspect. I have no problem with that. My problems with this book stem from the wider claims Goleman makes for EQ as a mental function. Goleman bases this aspect of his theory on some whopping assumptions. The biggest one is the idea that emotional intelligence even exists. The main aspects of EQ he posits (self-awareness, social-awareness,etc.) aren't objectively measurable and there is no proof that they even correlate with one another on a neurological level, which we would see if these aspects were part of a measurable form of human intelligence. Another assumption is that there is an acceptable norm of emotional intelligence. This raises the question, what about people who don't meet the norm? Under Goleman's narrow definition, people with autism, even many on the high-functioning end of the spectrum, would not qualify as possessing a desirable EQ level, neither would the introvert who prefers books to people. It is here that I found Goleman's ideas to be particularly objectionable. There's a whiff of something truly unpleasant here. However, we know that even people with severe autism are able to learn emotional skills. Goleman makes the grand claim that, throughout history, great leaders all had high EQ levels. (As a historian, this made me cringe when I first read it.) Unless one has access to a person's psychiatric records, it is always extremely problematic to make all but the most qualified claims about the psychology of historical figures. The EQ theory has many of the same flaws as theories of IQ. Older IQ tests assumed that intelligence was easily measured and that there was a single kind of intelligence. One frequently encountered people who had low IQ scores but who functioned intelligently or had highly advanced skills in some areas but not others. We now speak of multiple intelligences, seeing them as a skills set. We might be born with a tendency to some intelligences over others, but these are shaped by enviromental factors and can be influenced through learning, rather than something neurologically innate.I'm willing to accept the idea that people are born with a range of abilities to recognize and respond to emotional interaction. I think these emotional responses are learned behaviors to a much greater degree than Goleman would allow. The problem with books like Goleman's is that it presents one side of a very contentious debate, but it might be the only book on the subject many people will read. "
8,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000095-mahmut-homsi,4,"I think the best part of the book is when he explained about the five major components of the emotional intelligence as:1. Self-awareness: Recognize and understand your own moods and motivations and their effect on others. To achieve this state, you must be able to monitor your own emotional state and identify your own emotions. Emotional Maturity in this trait shows:-Confidence-Sense of humor (can laugh at self)-Aware of your impression on others (can read the reactions of others to know how you are perceived)2. Self-Regulation: Controlling your impulses—instead of being quick to react rashly, you can reign in your emotions and think before responding. You express yourself appropriately. Emotional Maturity in this trait shows:-Conscientious and take personal responsibility for your own work/deeds.-Adaptable (and favorable) to change-When someone is complaining or is rude to you, you do not respond in kind. You respond in a manner which would not escalate the situation. (At this point, you will also realize that when someone expresses anger at you, they’re not always angry at you; they’re often just angry and want to take it out on someone.)3. Internal Motivation: Internal motivation is marked by an interest in learning. It is also self-improvement vs. a pursuit of wealth and status (as a pursuit of wealth and status is an external motivator). Emotional Maturity in this trait shows:-Initiative and the commitment to complete a task-Perseverance in the face of adversity4. Empathy: The ability to understand another person’s emotional reaction. This is only possible when one has achieved self-awareness—as one cannot understand others until they understand themselves. Emotional Maturity in this trait shows:-Perceptive of other’s emotions and taking an active interest in their concerns.-Proactive—able to anticipate someone’s needs and the appropriate reaction.-Social Situations such as office politics do not phase one who has a firm grasp of empathy.5. Social Skills: Identifying social cues to establish common ground, manage relationships and build networks. Emotional Maturity in this trait shows:-Communication: Listening and responding appropriately-Influence and Leadership: The ability to guide and inspire others-Conflict Management: The ability to diffuse difficult situations using persuasion and negotiation."

10,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71486-kristl,3,"I had to read this book for a leadership academy I was in and I found this to be a surprisingly good experience.The book introduces and explains the concept of ""emotional intelligence,"" which, since beginning to read the book, I see is so much more important than almost any other awareness one could have on a day-to-day basis personally and professionally.Don't be shocked, if, in describing the many levels of emotional intelligence or lack thereof, you immediately think of friends, family, and coworkers that fit these personality types exactly.Once you begin to understand the makings of emotion and how different temperaments react to the varying levels of emotion, problems of all sorts seem to make more sense than ever before.The book is laid out into easily-digested chapters which the readers can pick and choose through based on their interests in the subject (brain chemistry? leadership? family dynamics? improving one's emotional intelligence?).It will be a better world when emotional intelligence or ""EQ"" is regarded as much or more than intelligence in deciding the viability of leaders at all levels and in all segments of any organization."

A good deep breath goes a long way.I love the concept of emotional intelligence - very useful in dealing with others."

First, author Daniel Goleman is the real deal. He has his PhD, of course, as do many snake oil salesmen, but unlike these others, Goleman has academic street cred: he founded an institute at Yale, heads up another at Rutgers, and wrote science columns for the New York Times.At first glance, I can see that this book, though written more than 10 years ago, still packs a punch. We still live in a world, after all, of road rage and horrific, random violence. From my brief inspection, it appears that Goleman describes how the emotional mind is just as important as the rational mind. Its short, pithy chapters are full of anecdotes. But be patient: it is packed with science. This is good, in case you want to get deeper into the subject.Here's Goleman's website and blog: [http://www.danielgoleman.info/blog/].

It should be ""Why It MIGHT Matter More Than IQ (provided you're comparing people of similar age, education, background, career, aspiration, social economic status, race, ethnicity, gender, and so on and so forth).""The group that was looked at in this book was executives, and what the author found was that the thing that set these people apart from their peers and others vying for the same positions is people skills. When you're good with people (and also a good speaker), you reach leadership level positions much faster. Seems obvious, yeah? Well, this book was written in the early 1990s, and while it's been revised and updated since then, the information has been repeated so many times, it's nearly common knowledge by now. (Forgot to clarify this look at executives and their peers is only a small part of the book.)What I was interested, but sadly wasn't addressed head-on, was whether or not emotional intelligence is innate. There's a lot of talk about brain chemistry and the evolution of the brain, yet no discernible answer as to the innateness of this type of intelligence. I get the impression the author thinks it can be taught--he does call it intelligence after all--but can it though? Don't you need a certain (innate) temperament to learn it? I mean, if you don't like people, that can certainly hamper the process. Anyhow. This is a good textbook overall and an easy read as it was written for the general public. Lots of concrete, ripped-from-the-headlines scenarios are used and dissected. So for me, there was a lot of ""fluff"" (for lack of a better word) to wade through before I found something interesting.

14,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4960830-katja,4,"Emotional Intelligence produced such conflicting feelings in me that I am torn as to what to write about it. For the most part, it is well-written, intelligent and compelling. The messages are simple yet profound, and I have to agree that the importance of social and emotional skills can’t be understated. On some level I think Daniel Goleman and I think in much the same way, and even though the book is 15 years old now, on the whole it is as applicable as it ever was. *disclaimer – angry rant coming up* On the other hand, it testifies to the importance of emotional intelligence, because if I had any less, this book would be lying in pieces in my backyard. One problem is that Goleman quite often makes the correlation = causation fallacy when citing research, which drives me bonkers. Secondly – and this is what really disappointed me - at several points throughout the book, he does one of the WORST possible things a non-fiction writer can do: he catastrophises. He shamelessly talks about the degradation of society, the decrease in moral fibre, and equates rising divorce rates with lower prospects for good relationships (I absolutely cannot stand the “divorce = unhappiness, marriage = happiness” argument – have we not progressed at all since the 19th century?). He cites a study that found children in their teenage years are more moody, secretive and irritable than when they were children – and uses that to support an argument that people are getting unhappier across the lifespan (really? Because that sounds like ADOLESCENCE to me). What makes the doomsday predictions particularly embarrassing is the statistics he cites regarding rising violence and cocaine use, stating expert predictions that violent crime among the young would increase drastically in the years to come. Too bad for Goleman that this “crime boom” widely predicted in the 90s never happened, and that the cocaine bubble burst that decade – resulting in the rates of both violent crime and cocaine use in the US decreasing drastically. The simple fact is that if Daniel Goleman hadn’t been so set on his overblown doomsday scenarios, his book would have been so much better – more measured, more reasonable, and much less likely to make me throw up all over it. Truthfully, he didn’t need all the catastrophising about the crumbling fibre of society to make a point for the importance of emotional intelligence – the rest of the book does that on its own. So all I can say is: on the whole it’s a great book, which could have been much better without the over-exaggerated scare tactics - much of which have since turned out to be false (which must be embarrassing for you, Daniel Goleman, but you deserved it resorting to arguments like that). I know that most of this review is an angry rant, but I've still given it four stars because I chose to be reasonable and not let those things be deal-breakers. I really did enjoy the vast majority of this book. Really."

While I knew a decent amount of the information beforehand as a Psychology student, several points stood out to me, such as the explanation of child molesters' mindsets, the idea that abused children gain heightened emotional perceptiveness, and almost all of the brain-related information. My favorite sections appeared toward the end, when Goleman shared success stories of emotional intelligence being taught in schools. One can only imagine - unless he or she works to make it a reality - the collective benefit of bringing social and emotional lessons to every Elementary school and beyond.Highly recommended for those who want to understand not only their own emotions, but the emotions of those around them. You can check out Jim's review for more about the contents within the book."

However, that doesn't necessarily make it a worthwhile read 20 years later, particularly for those in search of practical advice. There is a significant focus on how the brain works, but learning that the key to self-awareness is ""to have an activated neocortex"" may be educational but hardly practically useful. Similarly, advice on encouraging a timid child to be less so by ""gentle pressure to be more outgoing"" doesn't really need explaining as controlling their ""overexcitable amygdala"", not least as the recommendation is based on practical observation rather than deduced from the function of the brain.And the focus on including Emotional Intelligence in education of children is welcome, but the book's recommendations are focused more at policymakers and educators than individual parents.I found the occassional useful nugget but buried away - for example, the analysis of how arguments (particularly between women and men) can degenerate into personal criticism vs. stonewalling, leading to mutual frustration.But in reality many more practical books have been written since, including many by the author himself.

Fifteen years later it still has some good things to say, but knowing how we've not only ignored Goleman's advice but actually run in the opposite direction (empathy, anyone?) it just made me sad. The book concerns itself with a key set of characteristics he calls 'emotional intelligence': abilities such as being able to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustrations; to control impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods and keep distress from swamping the ability to think; to empathize and to hope.This time around I spent the most time on the section about emotional intelligence in marriage (something I had no use for in 1995) and found Dr. John Gottman's research front and center, where it should be. And the ""learn to adapt"" theory of child rearing he outlines? I really hope that comes back into fashion one day. "

It is 20 years old, and many of the things we take for granted now might not have been at the time. This book, above anything else, feels like a massive pamphlet to tell us that emotional intelligence is critical. And it shows what happens if we don't have it (either because of brain malfunctioning or bad parenting). This day and age I think very few people still need convincing that there is such a thing as emotional intelligence; we all know that Sheldon Cooper was at the back of the queue when they were handing it out. And while we love him on our television, we probably would dislike him in real life.Unfortunately i felt that this book wasn't giving me much more than reasons of EQ's existence. But there's nothing really to help you out. Nothing to suggest how to grow it if you feel you're missing a part of it. Nothing to aid you in dealing with low EQ people. Nothing practical in other words, i found it highly theoretical."

It, um, hasn't aged well?Honestly, while I felt like this made a lot of good points about self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skill, I felt like Goleman attributed a bit too much of society's problems to a lack of emotional intelligence instead of on systematic issues such as racism, prejudice and discrimination. For example, he makes the argument that people experiencing poverty and people who are imprisoned can learn to better themselves by improving their emotional intelligence (or if they had more emotional intelligence they wouldn't be in that situation in the first place), which was a gross over-simplification and also put the onus of a person's fate entirely on them instead of putting any on a broken system/a system design to keep people of color (and specifically Black people) down.Additionally, I was underwhelmed and exhausted by the heteronormativity of his arguments and points.So straight.So white.So tiring.So dated."
30,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17709230-winston-jen,5,"Before embarking on his gargantuan research project (which includes several meta-analyses and decades of research, galloped along by recent advances in brain imaging technology) Daniel Goleman writes a compelling and convincing case, eschewing jargon and esoteric terminology for a more humanistic and compassionate argument. He was not overreacting when he saw American society looming towards a cliff of violence, signs of which included school shootings. All over the world, children are doing worse on matters of emotional literacy and acumen. This, combined with a natural tendency towards aggression in some children, puts them at risk of precipitating the next Columbine massacre. More and more children exhibit signs of depression, secrecy, isolation, delinquency, drug use and violent tendencies.The book does begins with a look at the amygdala (which is the seat of basic emotions and instinct), hypothalamus (which controls involuntary movements and produces hormones) and the neocortex, which is most developed in humans and allows us to reason deeply and profoundly, to the extent of having thoughts and feelings about our thoughts and feelings.A gruesome and tragic emotional hijacking sets the stage for the importance of research into identifying and solving problems wrought by mismanaged impulses. After all, the word ""emotion"" comes from the Greek word meaning ""to move."" Our emotions have an almost ironclad hold on us.While IQ was traditionally thought of as the crucial and all-encompassing ingredient of success, Project Spectrum has turned this finding on its head, with its research into multiple intelligences including leadership and social awareness. This can be observed in children in elementary school and is a better predictor of future success than IQ. For instance, a young girl who knows how to pair her classmates into best friend groupings and identify their favourite toys has the talents for negotiation and peaceful conflict resolution. The foundational pillars of empathy can be seen at work.Mastering a musical instrument or honing one's natural gift for tennis or any other sport depends, more than anything else, on a child's desire to excel. Parents who push their own selfish aspirations onto their offspring will only foster bitterness, frustration and resentment in their children. The marshmallow restraint test, conducted on young children and followed-up decades later in life, proved an excellent predictor of self-control (which also happens to be one of the key components of learning HOW to learn).Conversely, child rapists and sociopaths have no connections or concern for others, and as such, become glib liars and are adept at making up horrific justifications for their ghoulish and barbaric deeds. These emotional cavemen seem to be impervious to psychotherapy at present.Dedicating oneself to charity work was shown to be an excellent remedy for anxiety and stress, but was also one of the least utilised options that was used by participants in studies. SEL classes offer hope to change this for the better in the future, and countries such as Singapore have already begun such programs. As anxiety and stress (disproportionate pressure and worry) can lead to an early death, there is a strong incentive for even adults to change their behaviour. A decade before Barbara Ehrenreich revealed the defeatism and victim-blaming that Norman Vincent Peale-style positive thinking can engender. Realism, compassion and companionship are far more crucial. Simply having someone with you who is willing to help shoulder one's burdens can even reduce repeat heart attacks and extend the lives of cancer patients.Relationships at work and in love are more similar than we might think, and something as simple as listening, repeating the other party's concerns, and taking breaks when necessary can prevent minor spats from exploding into divorce, termination of employment, or worse. And, as one could expect, parents who arbitrarily and randomly punish their children encourage their kids to emulate such behaviour (which can be seen even in young toddlers), become bullies, and link punishment to getting caught rather than hurting others. This emulation-instinct is so powerful that it can and will override a toddler's natural empathy, which, under normal circumstances, prevent them from continuing to clobber a child who is already hurt and whimpering.Counterintuitively, playing games such as ""Purdy"", where children re-enacted a school shooting (the perpetrator was named Purdy) can help them deal with trauma by exerting imagined control over a gruesome situation. Some Holocaust survivors were also observed to have recovered, at least in part, from the ever-present images of the terror and atrocities they experienced and witnessed. Therapy can give the individual control over their fears and traumas to the degree that they will never be held captive to them again.The book concludes with a hopeful look at the future and the possible fruits of research into brain plasticity and the promises of new technology. I wish Goleman and his research crew all the best in their endeavours."

The traditional belief is that higher IQ taller one’s success, I was one the person to be in hold of such belief, but the fact is higher IQ people flounder and the people with moderate IQ fare. The reason is? Emotional Intelligence. This is a book that enlightens us that more than IQ EQ is important and that which determines our success and failure.The cover of the book fairly plane, I must say it is not attractive, but I am happy that it is not having a gaudy outlook. After the dedication and the index; prelude is with a caption ‘Aristotle’s challenge’. It starts with a phrase from Aristotle ‘’ Anyone can become angry- that is easy. But to be angry with the right person to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—this is not easy’’Emotions—to move.He takes us to the anatomy of the emotional brain and tells us why emotions are important. Just imagine a human without emotions, like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory! Even this fictional character underwent an emotional meltdown at his Nobel speech. Sometimes these emotions can be crippling they can grapple us in their grip smothering us. Without any further ado, what is emotional intelligence? Intelligence related to our emotions? Or is it the way to handle our emotions? Or is it to manage others' emotions? It is, in fact, all of the above. In the pg. 43 of this book the author states Emotional intelligence is spread over 5 domains: Knowing one’s emotions—self-awareness, managing emotions, motivating oneself, recognizing emotions of others, and handling relationships. The more we are adept in all the domains the higher will be our success. But imagine this, I’m not trying to make it polemic, but apart from being successful a person who has all the 5 qualities will be the most liked person, isn’t it?This is a very dense book and to cover all the parts makes an own book of review, hence keeping it short I will conclude with something which I felt great about in this book.Worry: When we worry our thoughts revolve around the thought and this worry can trigger anxiety leaving us perspiring, rapid heartbeat, tremors and so on this, in turn, makes our worries worse. The first step of allaying this cycle of worry and anxiety is catching our emotions as soon as we can and then to practice relaxation methods.Depression: This is not about depression which is so severe which warrants medication, but moderate depression like subclinical depression- this lives with us thrives with our thoughts, we ruminate a lot on the subject which is causing depression. Two strategies are particularly effective in the battle- one is to learn to challenge the thoughts at the centre of rumination- to question their validity and think of more positive alternatives. The other is purposefully scheduling pleasant, distracting events.So the book is not solely about them, but a motley of other emotional aberrations and impacts on daily life. The above two topics were concluded in 2-3 pgs., I just posted it as I am connected with it; you can read this at any part of the day, I suggest to read it in the morning before you start your day so that you can exercise some points given in it.For one of the masterpieces I have ever read, I would love to rate It 4.5 of 5."
32,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/963280-janet,4,"I caught the ""emotional intelligence"" conversation early on with reading this seminal work by Daniel Goleman, and followed his work and then Boysatkis' work on Resonant Leadership. All of these books make the case that IQ is not as important as EQ. As the books and research progress (At Work, Primal leadership, Resonant Leadership), distinctions of what are key EQ skills are are shared. An extra step for me in my own self development of EQ was to learn how to listen to my heart versus staying in my head. After a brief introduction exploring the general issues of intelligence and the power of emotions, Goleman looks at new discoveries in brain anatomy and architecture, particularly as it pertains to what happens when emotions `take over'. The second, and longest, section of the book looks at the nature of Emotional Intelligence. This is being able to understand oneself as well as others, being able to control emotions (or not), and drawing on Aristotle's phrase from the Nicomachean Ethics, being able to have the right degree of emotion at the right time for the right reason for the right duration. Goleman's third section incorporates the general ideas of Emotional Intelligence into the broader context of living, stating that one's emotional intelligence is in fact a more critical factor than pure computational intelligence at being `successful' in many important parts of life - from personal relationships to professional relationships, self-satisfaction and self-growth, emotions often hold sway over traditional `intelligence'. The fourth section examines developmental issues, leading to the final section exploring what happens when such development goes wrong"

The root of extreme retaliation is often our misjudgement of innocuous gestures as hostile, contrary to host's intentions.This emotional outburst is the primordial first reflex before any rational critical thinking gets opportune moment to intervene with calmness. Hate crimes, domestic violence, assualt, muggings, rape and homicides are rising in juveniles as school fail to teach how to handle stress and rejections as mandatory part of curriculum. Maths and science cannot compensate for Emotional imbecility. We are soon going to see a spate of such crimes as vile adolescents are maturing to brute adults! Remember Nirbhaya'case ( India), school gun shooting and George Floyd's murder in USA, all due to emotional ineptitude !Watching photographs brimming with love, anger, frustration, depression,surprise, disgust and fear helps children to ape them and recognise such pattern in others- this brings out sympathy. This helps us to understand other's viewpoint, helping us to pause longer and muse better before yelling any reproach or assault.Such encounters should begin early in school, continue throughout adolescence and must be age specific. This ensures rational thinking is allowed to manifest subduing any violent reflexes.Character and self discipline both to avoid ills in life and tread path of virtuousness are both the cause and effect of having mature 'emotional intelligence'."

I was especially touched at the prospect of hope for people who have experienced trauma. Developing competancy in the art of managing feelings can lead to more positive relationships in life. Looking out for people who are struggling and offering real friendship can also be a positive catalyst for change. This was fun to read alongside The Five Love Languages for Children as I felt there was some overlap.

This is more about the theory of why we have our various emotional outbursts and less of a handbook like Harriet Lerner provides, but it really runs the whole gamet of clinical psychology, from child psychology to psychopathology. There's a few different sections, and some nice basic definitions in the appendix.  I don't agree with every theory Dr. Goleman posits, but he does talk about how to build emotional resilience and how a lot of our factors contribute to our emotional and social well being. I also really enjoyed the section on school programs that teach these skills, and remember learning some of these things when I was trained to do sexual assault intervention and training. If you haven't read a million books on these things, this is a good general book. If you have, I think there's still something to be learned. Bonus: I'm not really one to go on about school pride, but the University of Pittsburgh and its researchers were mentioned quite a few times :) "

41,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1259216-joy-h,4,"RE: _Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQ_ by Daniel Goleman (first published 1995) Added 6/5/11.I recently came across some old notes of mine which indicated that I had listened to an audio-tape of this book. My notes said:============================================""I think we all can be impatient at times (often with good reason), but it's how we handle that emotion which really matters. On the audiotape entitled: ""Emotional Intelligence"", the author advises that it's good to be aware of the emotions we are feeling and to understand what's causing them. Once we've figured that out, the next thing is to decide the best course of action. If we don't do this, our emotions may ""hijack"" our intellect and take over, causing us to do things we will regret later. I think that the term ""hijack"" is an excellent way to describe what happens when we lose our temper.The audiobook advises 3 stages:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~RED: Stop when we feel a strong emotion.YELLOW: Take time to calm down, and figure it out intellectually as stated above.GREEN: Go ahead, taking the best course of action.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It takes practice to do this, but it's part of emotional intelligence. Interesting stuff, no? It's also interesting to note that anger is a secondary emotion. It's brought about by a primary emotion such as feeling hurt or feeling jealous. At least, this is how I understood it from the audiotape. I've heard this type of analysis before and I think it rings true. As you can probably tell, I love this sort of thing.

42,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110237-andreea,5,"Daniel Goleman’s book is my definition of a great read. Before reading it I thought emotional intelligence was mostly about empathy, but what I actually learned is that you first need to understand your own feelings and reactions. I am not a fan of self-help books so I really enjoyed the combination of scientific explanations, experiments, social impact studies and real life examples the author provided.Our emotional circuits have been shaped during years of evolution, but it can happen that an emotional reaction is no longer suitable for the current context. The book starts by explaining the role of the amygdala in emotional responses and why emotional hijacking happens in an extreme situation. During our lifetime we can train our emotions, but it requires patience and discipline.My favourite topic from the book was emotional literacy. A lot of our emotional learning is done through childhood. Although we are born with specific traits of character, considered negative, we can be trained to change them. Bad results at school can be an outcome of a difficult emotional situations. Recognising a distressing situation or the actual feelings that impede you to perform at your best is the first step in soothing yourself. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs started as experiments, but have been taking off as stand-alone courses. They are meant to overcome the lack of emotional learning. Children are taught to recognise emotions (both their own and the ones of their peers), handle stressful situations and creatively solve daily conflicts. What I will probably always remember from the book is “The Marshmallow Test”, because during my childhood my grandmother was always making me take it."
43,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,2,"Carol Dweck cites this book frequently in her own book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success because it illustrates her thesis that success doesn't arise from talent or intellect but from the emotional qualities of patience and diligence. That's pretty much the point of this book, but there's more. It opens with an example of a straight A high school student whose teacher didn't write him a letter of recommendation for college, so he assaulted the teacher. All those A's won't do him a bit of good now. Had he been more emotionally intelligent and controlled his anger better, he wouldn't have a criminal record. The book goes on to explain emotional intelligence, describing how it helps in life, and even showing how kids can be trained in emotional intelligence if they're not getting it from their parents. There's also a chapter on the biology of emotions, but the discussion is highly technical and from an evolutionary perspective, so I skipped it. For the first half of the book, I was completely enthused. I especially liked how he broke down emotions into four basic ones: pleasure, fear, anger, and sadness. Even he says it's an over-simplification, but having that simplicity in the complex world of my own emotions was a fresh perspective I appreciated. But in the middle of the book, I gave up. The book has self-help elements, but it's more scholarship and argument, and I was just getting depressed over how emotionally unintelligent I've been. It was a best-seller, though, which proves that many, many people liked it. As for me, I prefer the emotional regulation system developed by Marsha Linehan."

You have to invest a lot of time in managing yourself and managing those with authority over you. The hardest thing to avoid within a large company is the conflict between colleagues, superiors and teams. First of all crazy things should be left home and personal things should be left before you enter the structure . I see a lot of employees complaining about their superiors bad management . You don’t have to. There are a lot of dysfunctional organisations but not only because managers are mislabeled. Like Peter Thiel said in his Zero to one book: If “Signalling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work you should quit”, however you will not find a better management situation elsewhere if you don’t master emotional intelligence skills. A smart employee should lead his superiors instead of complaining , the same thing he should do with his colleagues. A smart employee should have the capacity to control and be aware of the situation he is in charge and handle problems appropriately. This concept is defined as emotional intelligence and this book is describing all key points necessary to achieve both personal and professional success. Reputation may be the cornerstone of power but emotional intelligence is a critical part of leadership."

To understand why, I started reading several books on the subject: this book was one of many. I’m so glad I read Emotional Intelligence because it tied together a lot of what I’d learned in other books.So what exactly is emotional intelligence? Emotional intelligence is when our rational mind (neocortex) and our emotional mind (amygdala) interact well. There is harmony between head and heart. There is more to success than just high IQ, emotional intelligence is also needed. This book starts with a high-level overview of the brain: how it developed and how the different areas interact with each other. Next, Coleman explains what is physically happening in the body when we are experiencing different emotions. Having self-awareness, being in the moment, not judging ourselves is key to becoming emotionally intelligent. I really enjoyed reading this book, and I learned a lot. I learned how emotional intelligence affects our personal and professional life, how it plays a role in self-motivation, and how it helps us be persist in the face of frustration There’s one chapter dedicated to the workplace and how lack of emotional intelligence can hurt the team, productivity, and the company. Overall, a good book, and I highly recommend."
46,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892848-ednatee,5,"Every person must be able to understand and master his emotions if they are to succeed in life. Personal relationships suffer if they are leftunattended and ignored. Emotions can enrich our life as well as cause deprivation. During the Victorian era, emotions were suppressed, and not often shown. Being emotional was a sign of weakness, impolite or even unwelcomed. People strove mightily to cover or contain their emotions. Not knowing how to express them properly, they chose not to express emotions openly.Even well-adjusted people can have emotional turmoil but emotions areto be considered as much as or physical well being. Emotions are an integral part of our psychological orientation; putting the blue in the sky and song in the heart, so to speak. Emotions encompass a full range of human experience;pain and suffering, loneliness and melancholy, fear and anger, as well as joy and happiness.Every personality experiences a full range of emotions. Rather than fear and hide them . We should seek to understand and respect them."
47,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1235793-reid,4,"This may well be one of the most important books to emerge from the new psychological thinking, which doesn't seem to think of us as illnesses to be cured so much as potentials to be realized. The states of being to which these new theories point us are those of joy, satisfaction, happiness, and maturity. Goleman makes a convincing case that we have been given models of emotional behavior which are at best neglectful of what is needed, and at worst destructive. There is also a prescriptive aspect to the book, which allows us to educate a new generation to be more emotionally intelligent, as well as retrain ourselves. A psychologist as well as a journalist, Goleman is not in the business of developing pie-in-the-sky, unproven methods, but of reporting the most recent research and deriving from it the ways in which we might proceed. As such, it is a trustworthy guide to our emotional futures. Merely seeing the patterns in our own behavior is enlightening and can lead to the beginnings of change. Highly recommended."

People would be more compassionate, empathetic, and sensible. People would wonder less about others' behavior. People would be more aware of themselves, there feelings, their actions.This book beautifully describes biological reasons behind the origin of feelings and why our actions are so much influenced by our emotions. This book could be a first step towards self awareness. This book unfolds various secrets the evolutionary process of nature has kept in our brain.This book lets us know why emotional intelligence matters more than the IQ. If every parent reads this book, he/she can improve his/her relationship with his/her daughter. He/she can improve offspring's life by feeding them the hot soup of emotional intelligence. And I must recommend this book for every to be parent human being.This doesn't mean this is a child parent book. This book is for each and every one out there. I strongly recommend it. Read it as soon as possible to open up a different view to your life."

53,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77134847-vlad-ardelean,4,"This is one of those books out of which I won't be able to recall anything specific. Still I'm glad I read it.Stuff that I still remember from the book:It is semi-academic. Psychology today is weird. I go to this discipline curious to know how people work, and I find out all kinds of stuff about people with serious problems: suicidal impulses, drug addictions, violent, self-destructing, molested children, bullies, peopleneho can't name their feelings, and people who can't distinguish between fear and hunger. Wth psychology? Am I the only one who cares more about how the rest of us, without any serious condition work?...I mean I am not saying people with problems are not important, but those wothout them are simply far more numerous, and I personally am more curious about them. Am I the only one kind of sick of hearing about suicides when even approaching a psychologist? :p jkjk, it's not that bad, but it is an awkward aspect of psychology.Medicine has anatomy - there I think doctors learn about how the body works/should work. I want something similar for psychology.Ok, enough with the negative aspects. It's really not that bad :)Onto the positive side, I learned that:Between 0 and 3 years old, children learn a lot of emotional responses, and they will tend to keep them. Spend time with your small children and teach them that all is fine and that they can do it! They'll probably lead a very good life. Don't be violent with your children, you're increasing the chance they'll end up in prison.Other than that, ""advice"" I remember is:* Learn to delay gratification* Learn to stop and think about what the best reaction is, don't just ""go with the flow""* Learn how to calm yourself down* Learn how to name the feelings you go through* Try to be aware of yourself and what you're experiencing* Try to understand the state that other people go through* Any feeling is OK to have, but not all actions are ok to takeI don't know who to recommend this book to. Now that I just read it and forgot everything in it, not sure who would gain more from this. I guess anyone should read it, but probably it's not good for teens or younger children, because of the academic tone."
54,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,3,"This was about a very interesting subject, very thorough in taking in a wide range of aspects of 'emotional intelligence' (empathy, optimism/pessimism, being in touch with one's feelings, communication etc.) and attempting to explore the possible impact of these on folks lives. The author certainly brings together a lot of good research, and attempts to make these accessible to a wider audience. I certainly found several points very interesting indeed.However, the writing style did irritate me. Perhaps I have read too many other books in a similar format, perchance there is a certain manner of writing popular science non-fiction (esp. in terms of American authors?) but every chapter/section was '..first do an anecdote to back up the point the author is making and to make this more human interest, then throw in a bit of genuine science including the research that actually is the key matter, then cherry pick an example to back up the point..' and it got rather formulaic and repetitive. I also felt the book suffered a little from the bias that the likes of Malcolm Gladwell are guilty of so often, an unscientific reliance on discussing extreme examples that don't/shouldn't actually prove anything. For a book which should have said ""Emotional Intelligence is very important, as well as 'conventional' intelligence"", too often it seemed to imply that the former was more important and (to make the author's point) all you need. I'd rather have both, but if not.. I'd probably rather be right than be liked :-)"
55,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42440228-supriya-raghavendra,5,"Wish I had read something like this before stepping into my 20's! This book is a primer covering the whole range of human emotions, examined through various lenses such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, psychology and at times philosophy. The book also talks about interpersonal dynamics and recommends ways to navigate and regulate not only one's own but also other's emotional states effectively. Interesting to note contradictions such as how negative emotions like anger, melancholy, etc are seductive and draw people to it despite their inherent destructive tendencies. Personally, I've been charmed by melancholy for far too long and I understand why. I suppose, sometimes, one would indulge excessively in negative emotions with ""self awareness"", unable to escape their charm despite the found rationality in reading this book. :P Such is it's persuasive power. Finally, the book makes a compelling case for positivity as the norm to bounce back to no matter what be the predicament, by stating the long term medical costs of losing control over one's emotional states as in the case of anxiety, depression, rage, etc. The book is easy to read and makes for a casual self-helpish-yet-sciency kinda read. Useful to lead a happy-ish life!"
56,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,2,"Far too long and very repetitive.This book is for someone who has no idea what emotional intelligence is and knows nothing about the topic. However, this is no self help type of writing by any means, so if reader expects some guidance, one maybe disappointed. Author gives us an overview  on the topic of emotional intelligence through examples and studies. I was familiar with many of those studies and unfortunately have to mention that frequently author was heavily biased in his interpretations (to give one example-Dr. Ornish study which had a main goal to look into the influence of plant based diet on cardiovascular events and author interpreted it as improvement related to EI ). To author's benefit, he does mention that there are no well deleloped tests to measure EI, hence one has to be carefully when interpreting scientific data. There were some interesting observations made and generally I do agree with his thesis that people with well developed emotional intelligence have higher chance to achieve so called ""success"", at least in the western meaning of this word. Is it good or bad - depends what goals in life we have. Warning: misanthropic introverts with high IQ may feel somewhat depressed after reading this book."
57,055380491X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42782354-guilherme-zeitounlian,5,"Great book.It starts describing the physiology and the structure of the brain.Then it goes on to talk about- what is emotional intelligence, - why it is important, - some useful applications (as in medicine or the workplace), - emotional intelligence in childhood and trauma, and- programs that teach emotional literacy to children.The book is very thorough and, at the same time, objective.Some hallmarks of emotional intelligence include being able to- recognize and name the emotions you are feeling,- recognize and empathize with the emotions other people are feeling,- self motivate, delay gratification, and manage your moods, and- resolve conflicts and disputes in creative and assertive ways.There are programs that aim to teach emotional literacy to children (and adults as well). Psychotherapy may also help.Emotional intelligence is fundamental to living a better life. Reading this book is important, especially as a motivator to engage in the practices that help to be emotionally more intelligent.

We can lament over how millenials are entitled to being the emotional f*cks that we are or we can pull up our collective socks and do something about it.The book is well written, though perhaps a bit America oriented, but the crux is transferable to any society, they are all equally f*cked. The book, besides elaborating on what the problem is, lists out suggestions for practicing and spreading emotional intelligence in children and adults, in schools and workplace, for parents and friends.In my opinion this topic, not necessarily this book, should be a mandatory practice for young couples .. broken peeps can't raise emotionally healthy kids .. gotta start young .. you cant unf*ck their minds when there is no mind left !Lets bake this right :-)"

Since I am spending the Thanksgiving Holiday at home with the kids, it's a low stress situation where everyone more or less is in the same camp. Gen X, Millenials, Gen Y. So much easier with no Boomers of the tRumpist persuasion (yeah that kind of Boomer). Life is too short to have to defend yourself at the holidays. Peace to all on this great day for feasting with family and friends!
