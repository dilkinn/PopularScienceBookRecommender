0,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"Another goodreads.com reviewer made a comment about this book being safe for those types that believe in big G to read, that it wouldn't offend. I think that reviewer may have read a different version of this book. Sagan casually lobs out atheism grenades to dismantle a whole slew of arguments in favor of whatever you'd like to call that omniscient, omnipotent, prime mover in the sky but he does it so politely and without necessarily pointing out that he is pulling apart entire proofs with just a few words. As much as I like the two arch-atheists who blurb the back of this book (Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris) Sagan's demeanor is what is missing in the fight between the believers and the 'new-Atheists', he's as effective as any of the current so-called Four Horsemen but he has a style that is less combative than at least 3/4's of them and slides doubts into his arguments that I imagine settling into someone's mind and then maybe a few months or a year or whenever later will ignite a few thoughts, like maybe when they are unable to fall asleep one night and their mind is just rifling through miscellaneous clutter scattered here and there in the cortex and that little doubt meme Sagan slipped in so innocently will spark something. This book is a series of nine lectures about 'natural-religion', or religion that can be proved through observation. They were given in 1985 as part of the Gifford Lectures. The Gifford Lectures are apparently a pretty big deal and a who's who of intellectuals have been invited to give them over the years, and the basic topic is always natural-religion, which is a pretty open ended topic for one to talk about. Sagan begins by placing the Earth and it's inhabitants in a cosmic picture, he makes us realize how small we really are in the picture of the entire cosmos and he then gives a quick history of science lecture that shows how gradually the Aristotelean heliocentric view of the cosmos was decentered and from there begins talking about the painful process of having old cherished beliefs destroyed by new knowledge and the importance of putting our most cherished and emotionally held beliefs and doctrines to the most skeptical questioning. The lectures are all great. Sagan's excitement and love for what he is discussing comes through in the book and it's inspiring to read someone who seems so genuinely interested in imparting what he finds awesome to others. And he talks about all of the things in this book without ever breaking into jargon, burying the read (or listener, since these are lectures) with scientific details or in seeming to ever talk down the reader. Originally I thought I'd make this one of my rambling half-confessional half-diatribe reviews, but I think I'll just stick with what I have so far. I don't really like recommending books to people, but this one I will. Sagan does a great job making the world we live in seem great, wondrous, beautiful and full of mystery just as it is without having to resort to or add any myths or superstitious nonsense. "
1,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/652373-jay,5,"Where should I begin? A little over two years ago I watched the entire Cosmos television series on Netflix and - despite the fact I've always been scientifically literate and tried to live my day to day life with a healthy dose of skepticism, logic and reason - this television series rocked me to my core. I am not exaggerating when I tell people Carl Sagan changed my life. Never before had I experienced such depth of personal character and scientific knowledge. Never before had I witnessed such a candid presentation of the potential perils facing the future of the human species coupled with the level of hope, optimism and wonder often found only within the heart and mind of a child... all of this presented through the lens of human growth and scientific achievement throughout history.What does all this have to do with this book? The Varieties of Scientific Experience was my first book from Carl Sagan immediately following my exposure to his Cosmos Television series and I was thrilled to find that Sagan remains true to his reputation regardless of medium. I have yet to find anyone else who can present scientific fact in such an engaging way or anyone who can challenge superstition and religious dogma with such grace, patience or genuine compassion.If you are looking for a book willing to tackle the big questions in life - Why are we here, where did we come from and what is our purpose? - with logic and reason wrapped inside a generous slice of humility then look no further. When venturing through territory where Sagan is well versed he is direct and informative. When stepping into areas where he does not have a definitive answer he is skeptical yet humble.What an amazing human being Carl Sagan was and what an enjoyable testament to his life and his work this book is."

Believe in something that runs counter to mountains of existing, quantifiable evidence and you are religious. One of the most preposterous tenants of western theology is that everything exists for the benefit of man. The prevalent fundamentalist philosophy is one of anthropocentric smallness and irrefutability, a philosophy that only works if truths are somehow distorted or ignored. Carl Sagan, himself well versed in scripture, plows through these ideological conundrums to reveal a universal order many times more vast and awe-inspiring than anything the pulpit propagandists would like you to believe. Sagan's contention here is simple - if something as important as religion cannot withstand rational scrutiny, then it has no more validity than Greek mythology or Mayan astrology.""If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would he prefer his votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves."" ~C.S. (pg 31)"

4,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205823-erik,5,"This is the first book of Carl Sagan's that I've read, and I think it's probably the perfect bridge for me between my science books and the books on religion (or atheism) that I've read. I have seen Cosmos and found it remarkably ahead of its time, and the same is true for what Carl had lectured on at the Gifford Lectures, from which this book is transcribed. Always ahead of his time, and always showing amazing grasp of the topic at hand, the book is both funny and astonishing. Even though much of what he has said I've heard before (I'd even go so far as to say that more recent critics of religion, such as Dawkins and Hitchens, have simply rehashed Carl's original ideas) - the way Carl has with words is something you have to read firsthand. He phrases things in a way that, even though they are ideas not new to me, he gave me another way of thinking about them. And that's one of the things I love the most about science.I almost took a star off because the end chapter focuses a bit too much on our self-immolation at the hands of nuclear weapons (due to the paranoia of Cold War Soviet aggression) but I felt that it serves to keep the book rooted in a point of history that is both important and still quite relevant. Therefore, 5 stars.Highly recommend this book for fellow atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, and doubters. Even those who are already believers might find it enjoyable, despite being a challenge to their faith."
5,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/984092-katherine-parker,5,"Carl Sagan rules the Universe, kind of literally. I wish I were as smart as CS.Eric got me this book for Christmas, and I read it straight through, even the Q&A transcripts in the back. If you are interested in spirituality but don't believe in the Big Daddy in the Sky, if our mere existence (not to mention manatees, ferns, toads, the molten core of the earth, and billions and billions of stars) makes you sorta awestruck when you pause to think about it, this book will not fail to delight. I was happy to read that one of my main beefs with monotheistic religion (namely, that most people's view of God is too small - a micromanager who is watching over every aspect of your life, arranging it specially for you) was brought up by CS, who agrees with me. He also makes a beautiful argument that one of the best ways to search for/know/glorify God is to try to understand the natural world, the universe, and the laws that govern its operation. Even if you do believe in the esteemed JC as Your Personal Savior, you should still read this book. No matter who you are, this book will enlarge your idea of how amazing the universe is, shrink your sense about your own importance in it, and maybe spur you to see every moment of consciousness, every animal, plant, drop of water on this planet, as infinitely precious and worthy of esteem and care."
6,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book is a collection of the lectures Sagan gave during his Gifford Lectures appointment in Glasglow. Although he gave the lectures in 1985, they needed very little updating (done with minimal footnotes) upon their publication in 2006. I think the only thing I noticed that is irrelevant now is Sagan's musings about whether or not the universe is forever expanding, and the implications of a universe that expands and contracts (a footnote helpfully reveals that evidence now shows a rapidly expanding universe).I've noticed many reviews on Goodreads refer to Sagan as an atheist, which isn't correct (he's been quoted elsewhere that an atheist would have to know a lot more than Sagan does), but I can see how it's easy to come away from the book with that idea - his agnostic stance isn't really demonstrated until the Q&A transcript at the end of the lectures, where he points out that you can't prove something without evidence, but that a lack of evidence is not proof that something doesn't exist. There's a little bit of an overlap between this and Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark, but I think this is the better book; as I noted in my review of The Demon-Haunted World, the latter part of that book seems like a tangent that doesn't quite fit with the first part. The lectures in this collection, on the other hand, all go together very well and transition into each other nicely. On the other hand, The Demon-Haunted World demonstrates more of the balance between Sagan's wonder and skepticism. The lectures come off as being more on the skeptic side."
7,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312704-laura,5,"Well, I do wish everyone would read this book. I know that those with minds that are closed - whether known or not or willingly or not - would still not respond to the arguments that Sagan makes, but it might make a difference for those who are willing to take inquiry seriously. Sagan was a genius, but it was his ability to communicate to the masses that made him historical. Throughout his lectures, he evokes the wisdom of others --From the intro: ""he insisted with Bertrand Russell that 'what is wanted is not the will to believe, but the desire to find out, which is the exact opposite.'""On miracles, he quotes Hume and then Thomas Paine: ""Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?""On the function of religion, he quotes Pierre-Simon (post-Newtonian scientist and partisan of the French Revolution): ""Far from us be the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.""And finally, in his own words, the final paragraph: ""I think if we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed. I think this search does not lead to a complacent satisfaction that we know the answer, not an arrogant sense that the answer is before us and we need do only one more experiment to find it out. It goes with a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.""Then he goes on to school some common folk in the Q&A (the common folk being those smart enough to brave asking questions - those smarter than me)."
8,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43662790-cat-lennon,5,"This is quite possibly my favorite book of all time, at least up until this point. While, of course, almost every page could stand to be expanded upon, this book is a wonderful introduction to the orientation of humanity in the universe and the search for God through the eyes of a scientist- or somebody armed with only scientific truths. It put into words some of the elements of astronomy that caused cognitive dissonance for me when I took my ASTR 101 class in college as a very educated Catholic (in apologetics, no less). The same basic truths revealed in this book caused me to question the years and years of study of (albeit basic) theology and philosophy that I had used to convince myself of truths that now seem so logically incestuous, complex, and comparatively trivial/meaningless that I don't understand how I ever could have thought I was headed in the right direction. Many of the ideas in this book reinforced my initial thoughts on those little dogmatic quirks.Carl thinks skepticism is the best route in the face of uncompelling or nonexistent evidence, while remaining open to new evidence and appreciating the immense beauty found in even just the natural wonders of physics and astronomy, and humanity as well- evolved as we are. This book does not cover everything. There is still so much to be explored, but if you are religious, it will demand that you look at your existence from a completely different perspective. You may find yourself questioning the little dogmatic quirks of your religion, or the concept of religion overall. I highly recommend it. Oh, and the first paragraph of the acknowledgements made me tear up, but I tend to be overly sentimental. The world lost a great man in 1996."
9,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines,5,"Imagine that at some long ago point in human history, a human first looked at her hand, and knew for certain that that hand was her very own. And from there she would look at things, think about how things worked, and put things together in order to survive and ultimately to thrive.Now imagine some distant point in the future. Where will we be? It’s impossible to say but the possibilities, if made simple enough, are clear. We will either be alive and thriving, or we will not be anywhere at all.The Varieties of Scientific Experience is a realistic attempt to define where humanity is on the path between that past moment of realization and those two possible futures. Sagan gives this assessment in the most selfless of terms that humans can avail themselves of, which is the scientific method. Everything he puts forth is qualified in terms of its level of understanding and nothing is put forth that does not have Sagan’s beliefs as supported by physical and real evidence. It is simply the very best that humans can do to define ourselves, and to define everything around us.As for our actual location on that path, readers are left to decide for themselves. There are no certainties expressed by Sagan. The books thickness alone is enough convey the fact that arm-twisting, complicated mythos, or assertions of opinions based on lengthy stories are not included. And again, the selflessness of science (as well as our very survival) demands that we as individuals make this evaluation for ourselves. Our future depends upon it."
10,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/665262-dustin,5,"Carl Sagan was one of the best at taking an exceptionally complex issue, often fraught with emotional and intuitional baggage, and rendering it into language that anyone can easily understand. He was also extremely generous in allowing that in any discussion of science or religion, no one, not even he, has all the answers, or maybe ever will.This book is a transcript of a series of lectures he gave at Glasgow University, dealing with natural religion, which basically deals with the intersection of real science and religion (as opposed to the pseudo-scientific quackery often paraded on tv as ""science."") Also included are transcripts of Q&A sessions that were held after each lecture.A must read. I won't even bother to try to summarize any of his ideas or findings, as there is no way I could do any of them justice."
11,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/753809-mike,4,"Sagan quietly states in the middle of a sobering paragraph that ""God is the sum of all natural laws in the universe."" Yes, Sagan challenges the faithful to provide evidence acceptable to him (which is nothing less than a phenomenon observed and replicated by many), and his demand is contrary to the law of faith. However, Sagan's challenge motivates me to undertake careful inventory of my own knowledge, both secular and religious, to substantiate my personal beliefs. In the near future, I hope to answer in the affirmative the following question: ""can I defend my faith as well as Sagan does in undermining it?"" "

While each lecture is self contained, the come together as a whole - each obliquely addressing questions about man's place in the universe, basic science, the relationship of rational inquiry to religion, and the implications of belief in extraterrestrial life.Here, Sagan is presented in his typical form. He is at once witty, understandable, profound, and compassionate. Of particular interest is the transcript of the various Q&A sessions which accompanied the lectures. Sagan displays great charm and humanity in his handling of those who attempt to attack his ideas. It's truly incredible to observe the confident humility of one of science's greatest minds."

I particularly liked the section in the back where he's transcribed the post-lecture questions and well-fielded answers. You'll be entirely entertained and interested, guaranteed.The book is not solely about God, it's also about (other) extraterrestrial intelligence and many other interrelated fields. Also, Sagan's not one tenth so vehement an atheist as Dawkins, and potential readers afraid of learning the truth about God can rest easy sitting down with this one."
14,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22269025-robin-friedman,4,"Carl Sagan's Search For GodI was moved to read Carl Sagan's ""The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God"" (2006) after reading the classic study for which it is named: ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (1902) by the American philosopher and psychologist, William James. As was James's book, Sagan's book consists of the text of Gifford lectures, Sagan lectured in 1985, James in 1901 -- 1902. The Gifford lectures were established in Scotland in 1888 to ""promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term -- in other words, the knowledge of God."" Many distinguished thinkers have delivered the Gifford lectures over the years.Carl Sagan (1934 -- 1996) was an American astronomer who became famous for his efforts in presenting science to a wide lay audience. In spite of the title of his book, which was given not by Sagan but by his editor, Ann Druyan, Sagan's lectures include no mention of James and little consideration of James's approach to religion in the ""Varieties"". Sagan's book is fascinating nonetheless. But I find it tempting to think of ways in which his approach might be complemented by that of James.Sagan approaches religion from his background as a scientist. He takes complex scientific ideas and explains them learnedly and eloquently. He covers matters such as the origin of the universe and of the planets, the age of the universe, geological time, the origin of life, the likelihood of finding life on other planets in other galaxies, UFO's, and much else. The book is punchy and provocative without becoming overbearing.Sagan argues that mankind's source of knowledge of the world comes through science. He argues that the view of the world presented in the Bible, with its creator God active in human affairs, cannot stand the light of scientific scrutiny. He is a skeptic in matters of religion and revelation and he argues that the better course for people is to withhold judgment on matters that they do not know or understand until sufficient reliable evidence is available on which to draw a conclusion. He describes, broadly, in his book how modern science gradually has destroyed the sense of a teleological (purpose-driven) human-centered universe, created and directed by a God with a divine plan, and replaced it instead with universal scientific laws of physics and chemistry. As have many thinkers before him, Sagan examines many of the traditional proofs for the existence of God and finds them wanting. He gives particular emphasis in this book to the argument from design and to the cosmological argument. In his concluding chapter, Sagan comes close to equating the religious search -- in the subtitle of the book -- with the search for scientific knowledge. He concludes (p.221) ""I think this search does not lead to a complacent satisfaction that we know the answer, not an arrogant sense that the answer is before us and we need do only on more experiment to find it out. It goes with a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us."" From this book, Sagan's philosophical heroes, whom he mentions many times, appear to be Spinoza and Albert Einstein, excellent company indeed.I want to make a brief comparison of Sagan's approach with that of William James and to suggest that the two approaches largely bypass each other because they are directed to different questions. Sagan considers religion from the standpoint of scientific knowledge. James, in contrast, took as the theme of his ""Varieties"" the ""exploration of religious themes and religious impulses."" James defines the scope of his study as ""the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude so far as they apprehend themselves to relation to whatever they may consider the divine."" Thus, James explored the phenomena and the experiences of religious life without making any commitment to the cause of or the ""objectivity"" of these experiences, without commitment to revelation or particular religious dogma, and without challenging the teachings of science. James tried to consider what it was of value that people found in the religious quest and in religious experience. He tried to do so, for the most part, by leaving science free to explore and expand our understanding of the world and of physical law -- as this was understood in James's day and as it has expanded dramatically in our own.Sagan's account is stimulating, and it reminded me of how much science has indeed changed our outlook on life -- including our religious outlook. I found it liberating. But I found it offered only a partial understanding of the religious search, it purports to describe in the subtitle, and of the religious life. I think religion needs to be approached by, in the words of many religious teachers, ""looking within"". Such a search need not require the contravention of the teachings of science, the postulating of revelation or of divine entities, or the deprecating of the value of the scientific endeavor. It is a search for meaning and self-understanding. I think this approach goes further even than the approach James took in his ""Varieties"", but his text suggests it to me. In this sense, I think that Sagan has only studied part of his broad issue. There is room both for his scientific approach and for the complementary approach of William James, who in his Gifford Lectures delivered the still-landmark study of the Varieties of Religious Experience.Robin Friedman"

i think if we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed. i think this search does not lead to a complacent satisfaction that we know the answer, not an arrogant sense that the answer is before us and we need do only one more experiment to find it out. it goes with a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.

16,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132194-ryan,4,"It is so refreshing to finally finish a book. Since my life as an adult has begun (post-college), finishing a book is an increasingly rare event. I currently am on a science kick to such a degree that I have found myself wondering if I ought to go back to school and get an undergraduate degree in biology. Why? Just for fun. Anyway, this book is a book of recorded lectures that Sagan gave in Britain--something called the Gifford Lectures, which are probably prestigious. Anyway, they concern science and religion, and, really, for Carl, how religion just doesn't stand up to any sort of scrutiny. One major theme of the book is that no one should ever believe a proposition unless there be evidence to support that proposition. I think this is a basic, fair piece of advice to follow.  When he's not discussing the debate between science and religion, he is discussing what we have learned in the realm of astrophysics, and he does an excellent job.  Since Sagan has died, I don't think anyone has picked up the mantle for champion of science. Dawkins has tried, but he is rather insolent and argumentative. Although I personally like Dawkins a lot, I don't think his personality suits him to be the champion of science that is needed. "

I love his optimism and open-mindedness, as well as his refusal to accept unsupported beliefs just because they might make us feel better. Today's popularizers of science and skepticism (Richard Dawkins, et al) are saying a lot of the same things, but Sagan had a gift for tempering uncompromising skepticism with an empathy for believers that didn't require them to feel like chumps. He personified the free and responsible search for truth and meaning. I wish he were still with us today."

Easy to read, very thoughtful, and quite entertaining. In a nutshell, Sagan does not come out and say ""there is no god."" Instead, he simply says that there is no physical evidence for the existence of a god. "
21,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,5,"[Although I finished this book about a month ago, I decided to let its message sink in before this review. After all, I've added this book on my read list since Dec 2008. To spoil this review: I loved it.]The Varieties of Scientific Experience is a book about science viewed as ""everything about the world not supplied by revelation"". Many books have been written on this topic, that is, of science as the complement or even supplement of religion, from the most playful (Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman, etc.) to the most solemn (Nature and the Greeks and Science and Humanism by Erwin Schrödinger, Physics and Philosophy by Werner Heisenberg, etc.) going through everything in between (The Grand Design et al. by Stephen Hawking], The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil etc.). Carl Sagan's approach, constructed two decades after his death from his Gifford Lectures (1985), is a wonderful, reasonable, in places scientific take on the topic.The book covers much ground around the idea of natural theology, that a scientific god is the only god that can be shown and demonstrated, and thus believed. Sagan does not try to dissuade from traditional religion, but admits he is skeptical of it and goes far in contrasting the two forms of belief. For him, reality can provide a revelation that is not only deep, but also observable and can be demonstrated to others; the instrument of correct observation is science. This sets science at odds with the way people perceive traditional religion, influenced by personal epiphanies and enforced by custom, social ties, and even ingestion of behavior-changing molecules. Sagan is persuasive without being too argumentative and despite a high-level view that leaves much room for discussion. What strikes throughout the book is the wonderful language, both in the polished lectures and in the Q&A (so live) sessions. It's the language of a scientists, eloquent yet deeply anchored to evidence, showing the character of the speaker yet representing the minds of many, slashing through yet modest, to the point yet tragi-comic when needed. Here is an example, in which Sagan discusses a new molecule, yet to be invented, that would lead to religious experience just as beer leads to temporary intoxication:""Let's say there's a molecule that produces a religious experience, whatever the religious experience is. How does that come about? Virtually every time someone takes that molecule, he or she has a religious experience. Does that not suggest that there is a natural molecule that the body produces whose function it is to produce religious experiences, at least on occasion? What could that molecule be like? Let's give it a name, since nobody's discovered it yet, and of course it may not exist--a good one would be ""throphiline,"" but that has been preempted for an antiasthma drug. And I think ""theotoxin"" would be biasing the issue too strongly. So let's call it ""theophorin"", a material that makes you feel religious.""Before I introduce the spoiler, let me make this clear: I loved this book! I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of one's own scientific and religious beliefs. ***** This part contains spoilers*****(view spoiler)[The book is comprised of nine chapters and a selection of the Q&A session that followed the lectures. The chapters follow in loose order the theme of the book, but can be read independently. The first chapter introduces the antithesis science/religion as believable by contrasting the universe we know about today with the universe described by the Judeo/Christian/Muslim religions. Chapter two argues for our constant biasing of things that are grander than us, especially towards deciding that those things must not only have a role, but also depend on and revolve around us; the anecdote about Newton being fooled into this line of thought is used as an argument that ""we can all be fooled"". The chapter again contrasts the real universe (as observed scientifically, until 1985) with our traditional beliefs. Chapter three moves from astronomy to chemistry and biology, and continues the contrasts, this time between the theory of evolution of Darwin and the pseudo-science of myth. Chapter four discusses our role as investigators of the universe; the anecdote is here about the Drake equation, which shows that, taking an optimist's view, non-human investigators may exist. Chapter five is an attack, fists raised and head-on, on a variety of semi-religious myths (this complements well the similar take in Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman); in short, Sagan tells us how to reason against trifle without losing ground or being ridiculous. Chapter six presents a view on religion from astronomical heights, where the author contrasts a scientific god (of Einstein and Spinoza) with the traditional gods. Chapter eight is based on the borders of scientific knowledge at that time and, as such, is not as clear as the other parts of the lectures. However, this chapter does have a lasting contribution, as it introduces ""theophorin"" as the material or molecule that could give people an instant of religious feeling (the actual words were presented earlier). Chapters nine and ten discuss the main challenges of today (nukes) and tomorrow (leaving a dying planet before it's too late), respectively. (hide spoiler)] "
22,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/650142-alex,5,"I enjoyed the survey of Sagan's thought presented in Varieties thoroughly. As ever, Sagan gently and compellingly presents his poetically scientific view of the universe. While there were no surprises here — no message that can't be found elaborated upon in Sagan's other works — I found this book unique for two reasons.First, Sagan's audience is made up of at least as many theologians as scientists. The book collects his Gifford lectures, whose premise is to discuss ""natural theology"" — the ways in which we might apply observation and rational thought to discerning the presence of God. Sagan's message is accordingly tailored, focusing on areas where science and religion have historically overlapped (or not) in times past, and their potential roles in the future. On such tricky ground, I am continually bowled over by Sagan's grace: he is the rhetorical opposite of someone like Richard Dawkins, exhibiting calm, poise, and kindness even when his argument is drawn torturously through semantic and stonewalling arguments. While I doubt he has any respect for an unfounded belief, he unfailingly displays respect and compassion for the human beings that produce them.And that's the second uniqueness I found here: the interplay with the audience. The last third of the book consists of transcripts of the question and answer sessions that followed each lecture. It's during these exchanges that the audience (primarily believers) probe Sagan's point of view, even (not surprisingly, really) deconstructing the premise of the Gifford lectures themselves. While edtior Ann Druyan (Sagan's widow) admits the transcripts are only partial, what remains are for me rare and precious examples of graceful scientific passion in the person of Sagan, and inspiring prototypes for the civil and rational exchange of ideas between people of vastly different ideologies.In short, fans of Sagan probably won't find any earthshattering revelations here. Instead, Varieties yields a welcome echo, more than a decade after his death, of Sagan's discerning mind, his illuminating explicative talent, and his hopeful spirit."
23,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16133372-ziqi,5,"Containing entrancing prose with beautifully formatted pictures, the book is comprised of a series of lectures Sagan gave at the University of Glasgow in the eighties, but reads like a continuous work (hats off to Ann Druyan's editing), and contains some Q and A's in the back. I read this a couple of months back, and the conversational passages Sagan penned still resonate in the back of my mind. This book, much like his others, begin with the classic Sagan treatment--pulling you back, back, back into your proper place in the universe. This is achieved through the various pictures from the Hubble space telescope, along with insightful dialogue hinting at our own insignificant nature in the vast cosmos. Sagan then jumps into conversations revolving around the future of space exploration, delves headlong into speculations concerning extraterrestrial life (Drake's equation and von Daniken), leading to complications in belief, in faith. Religion and science (and the battles between the two) are prevalent themes throughout the book. But instead of espousing one and degrading the other, Sagan weighs them with equal hands and treats the issue with an open mind. This, of course, as the title hints, is the meat of the book--leading the reader to question the existence of an omniscient, omnipotent being. My favorite quote: ""Many religions have attempted to make statues of their gods very large, and the idea, I suppose, is to make us feel small. But if that's their purpose, they can keep their paltry icons. We need only look up if we wish to feel small. It's after an exercise such as this that many people conclude that religious sensibility is inevitable."" (from pg.28)Through the open discussion and his own wit, Sagan's book transcends the traditional aporia surrounding science and religion, and lays the foundation for a clearer, more directed discussion leading you to make your own hypotheses. I wholly recommend this book, for enlightened conversations will undoubtedly ensue. "
24,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24046532-anik-islam,5,"""The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God"" is a compilation of Prof. Sagan's talks at the Gifford Lectures in 1985. During the whole time I was reading the book, it almost felt as if Sagan was speaking in person, as if he were painting an image with his beautiful use of words and phrasing. He takes the readers through a journey starting from the vast corners of the universe to molecular level and the building blocks of life. The best part of it all is how he combines astronomy, evolutionary biology, theology, anthropology, history, religion, social science, politics and the future of humanity into one big picture, leaving the readers to contemplate, reevaluate, question and search for answers every step of the way. Its amazing how he took on complex issues, ones that are often accompanied by emotional and institutionalized bias, and broke them down while maintaining logical consistency, providing numerous scientifically coherent evidences and at times addressing them with compassion. Its a great show of humility and eagerness to learn, when a man of his stature of intelligence and knowledge admits that even he doesn't possess all the answers when it comes to topics of science or religion. The book consists of transcripts of 9 lectures, followed by the transcripts of Q/A sessions. You will have to read the book yourself to experience, appreciate and ponder on this masterpiece of sheer awesomeness. This is my first book by Sagan and I am very much glad that I started with it. "
25,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2200054-kylene,5,"I was drawn to this book because I had read William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience years ago. And the title indeed was based on James' title, each book being a series of lectures given as the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion at the University of Edinburgh. Carl Sagan never really spells out what he believes about God. This is something everyone must discover for himself. Sagan gives us a set of tools for baloney detection which will work for every subject we come across. He speaks of science in ways a complete illiterate (me) in the subject can understand and become excited about. So, after reading the book, I found myself with answers to everything I had so long wondered about, with a new awareness that life is fleeting. Yet life itself is a thing of wonder and awe. The things there are to learn about our species and our universe are truly endless; everything Carl Sagan wrote being a good place to start. Perhaps this book especially feels like he's talking with us because these were lectures. But I get this feeling from his other books as well, and although there have been advances and discoveries since he wrote them, his style and approach awakens an excitement for his subject. There are also transcripts of questions and answer sessions that took place after each lecture. Many thoughts from many intelligent thinkers, and Sagan's warmth and humor shining through. I would recommend this book to everyone! "
26,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93635-jason-etc,5,"This is easily the best exploration of the relationship between science and religion I've ever read and, given the pedigree of the explorer and his current state (dead), likely a very difficult one to top. Now, one fairly common refrain that I've seen from people less enamored with the content is that he appears dismissive toward the concept of religion. I understand the beef, but I think Mr. Sagan is less dismissive of belief than with the way it's sold. He picks apart the arguments for the existence of god(s) because they purport proof based on the written word, reported miracles, causal correlations between devine intervention and, say, the odd earthquake, and other bits of supposed evidence. What he does NOT pick apart is faith in something that can be labeled 'g'\'G'od. In fact, he explicitly states: “...the fact that I do not see evidence of such a God's existence does not mean that I then derive from that fact that I know that God does not exist. That's quite a different remark. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Neither is it evidence of presence.”That's as effective a statement supporting a pragmatic approach to belief as I can imagine. Believe whatever you like, cultivate your faith in whatever way that makes this life less burdensome, but remember that such a 'truth' is yours alone and not readily transferable to anyone else. "
27,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825885-mazola1,5,"In 1985, Carl Sagan gave the Gifford Lectures on Natural Theology in Scotland. His wife, Ann Druyan, found the transcripts, together with Sagan's notes for a book he had hoped to write with her about a synthesis of the spiritual perspectives they had derived from the revelations of science. Druyan, noting that William James turned his own Gifford lectures into his famous and influential book, The Varieties of Religious Experience, collected and edited Sagan's Gifford lectures, and titled the book, The Varieties of Scientific Experience.The result is a delightful book. Even with the passage of over two decades, Sagan's thoughts do not seem dated. The lectures range the psssibility of life on other planets, the risk of nuclear annihilitation, intelligent design, and why people believe in God. Sagan is amazingly lucid and entertaining, with insights into deep subjects put in simple and vivid language. The lectures demonstrate why he is probably the best selling science author who ever lived. He truly has the knack of making what could be arcane and dull subjects come alive and shine. "
28,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,4,"Vonnegut summarized this book far better than I ever could when he said:""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being. I miss him so.""As do I.The Varieties of Scientific Experience is largely a transcription of Professor Sagan's (and he truly deserves that title) 1985 Gifford Lectures, which may sound, to the uninitiated, rather dry and uninteresting. However, as I read this book I found myself wholly engrossed, as if he was speaking directly to me. Not only are his arguments, theories and points for consideration as relevant and evocative today as twenty-five years ago, but Sagan also, in his inimitable way, once again succeeds in relating higher scientific and theological concepts in a way that is both eloquent and accessible to the common person.Intelligent, insightful and poignant, Varieties is both an entertaining and thought-provoking read. I would recommend it to anyone who, in our increasingly enlightened age, struggles with how to reconcile prevailing religious beliefs, or the desire for spirituality, with what we know to be logical or true through science."
29,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4509059-danni,5,"the following quote best represents this excellent read:""... What we need is a honing of the skills of explanation, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another's belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils [our] species.""this book encompasses a series of lectures given in 1985 - its messages are still relevant and is full of awesome musings to inspire present and future Sagan fans alike."

All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely.

31,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
38,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."

40,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

41,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

43,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "

Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

58,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
59,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"
60,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"This is an easy-to-read summary of Carl Sagan's science and beliefs by Sagan himself, appearing as a transcript of nine lectures he gave in 1985. All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
61,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
68,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."

70,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

71,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

73,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "
76,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38104-chad,4,"Carl Sagan was a truly amazing man, and this relatively brief and accessible collection of talks he presented when he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures back in 1985 is only one of many reasons why. Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

88,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
89,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"

All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
91,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make?

Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future.

We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read. I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
98,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."

100,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

101,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

103,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "
106,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38104-chad,4,"Carl Sagan was a truly amazing man, and this relatively brief and accessible collection of talks he presented when he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures back in 1985 is only one of many reasons why. Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

It is a very good book with some great quotes taken from other authors or philosophers & information about the infancy of our species, our planet & our solar system.

Just so many thoughts and ideas and science packed into this book.

118,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
119,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"

All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
121,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

We matter and we are matter - [ ] Drake equation - [ ] The largest uncertainty is the life time of a technical civilization - [ ] ‘We have imposed human values on the universe. . . if humans succeed in destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, a case can be made, that all the other animals are smarter than humans.- [ ] He takes a dig at human intelligence and reminds us of the folly of nuclear weapons - [ ] The answer to the Drake Equation ranges from we are the only civilization in the galaxy to the possibility of millions of other planets were there is life. If there is life nearby it could be cosmically close, a few hundred light years - [ ] What is certain is that if we are contacted by another civilization they are certainly fair more advanced than us. They will likely have technology and knowledge that we are unaware of. But if they wish to communicate with us then they will have to use what is to them, rudimentary technology. They would speak to us and we would listen, similar to how we interact with history, the great thinkers speak to us from the past and we listen- [ ] He goes on to dismiss ancient aliens and UFO sightings.

The laws of nature exist everywhere in the universe. The laws of nature are surely a power greater than ourselves. In a sense the laws of nature are a form of god- [ ] Christianity, Islam, Jewdism, have much more in common than any trivial differences - [ ] The world is vast yet we have a vast number is different religions and beliefs, they all represent their part of the world- [ ] He goes on to skeptically interrogate religions - [ ] He breaks down all of the arguments for god and concludes that none of them provide enough evidence to support the idea of a supreme being. He needs evidence. I admire his commitment but it’s a bit of a buzz kill. I don’t have his commitment to skepticism and the idea of there being no god terrifies me. For Sagan the truth was more important than fear. He wanted to know, not believe - [ ] It’s possible that the Buddhists believe that there god is so perfect that there is no need for that god to exist - [ ] Honestly I tune out during talk of refuting/disproving god.

I am gonna reread this section!!!- [ ] Powerful people that use religion/heaven to suppress others are the opposite of what he stands for. Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make? We made the wrong ones- [ ] He was talking about technology before the internet or smart phones, he never had an email. He would have been blown away- [ ] Great section about human survival and our extinction, classic Sagan- [ ] He compares what is happening now to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Does not reference climate change much, this is focused on nuclear weapons - [ ] He does acknowledge the positive aspects of religion, community, social organization, morality, positive social causes, story telling - [ ] He was well versed in religious texts and from what Sasha says in her book he did respect aspects of religion, practiced some traditions, and taught her about the stories and allegories - [ ] In many ways he expects more from religion and wanted faiths/leaders to do more positive and take a proactive moral lead in helping the world, in preventing nuclear war, caring for the poor, standing against atrocities, and caring for people/the planet - [ ] An alien visiting Earth may see what we are doing and see how foolish it is, they may decide to pass us by and move on to the next planet - [ ] What we are doing with nuclear weapons is terribly terribly foolish - [ ] We are at a turning point and we must make a decision about the direction of the species, destruction or survival - [ ] ‘In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how are we able to find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give fair hearing to everything, there is a world wide close mindedness that imperials the species’- [ ] I will listen and then write notes- [ ] We must broaden our views, seek diverse opinions/ideas - [ ] ‘The courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us’- [ ] We have an obligation to survive - [ ] He does not claim that we will survive just that we have the capability to survive, it is our choice on what we do - [ ] All governments lie to protect themselves and to stay in power. Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future. In a sense there is battle between good and evil. We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read. I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
128,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."
129,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97279304-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology. He recounts the story of The Fall. Not the biblical fall of some disobeying, naked, apple eating Adam and Eve but the Copernican fall from center of the universe to an ""uninteresting "" blue spot not even in the center of a galaxy that is a part of 100 billion other galaxies. And Lo ! He cast his wrath on the old superstitions. Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach. My favorite parts are his discussions of the arguments of natural theology: Cosmological, second law of thermodynamics, argument from design , from consciousness and the old ontological stuffs (I wouldn't call it an argument ). He drew many analogies between them and other extraterrestrial folklore stories.Nevertheless, the heart of this work is constructive: it is a message of openness, of the value of our rarity and the never ending search for meaning and truth.

The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

131,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."
132,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4500875-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology. He recounts the story of The Fall. Not the biblical fall of some disobeying, naked, apple eating Adam and Eve but the Copernican fall from center of the universe to an ""uninteresting "" blue spot not even in the center of a galaxy that is a part of 100 billion other galaxies. And Lo ! He cast his wrath on the old superstitions. Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach. My favorite parts are his discussions of the arguments of natural theology: Cosmological, second law of thermodynamics, argument from design , from consciousness and the old ontological stuffs (I wouldn't call it an argument ). He drew many analogies between them and other extraterrestrial folklore stories.Nevertheless, the heart of this work is constructive: it is a message of openness, of the value of our rarity and the never ending search for meaning and truth. "
133,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "
134,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10484068-jim-lane,5,"It's hard to believe that over 20 years have gone by since my interest in astronomy was kindled by watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos series on PBS. Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."
135,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/231142-paul,5,"In the land of platitudes and prophets, here is the real thing: an American hero. How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "
136,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38104-chad,4,"Carl Sagan was a truly amazing man, and this relatively brief and accessible collection of talks he presented when he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures back in 1985 is only one of many reasons why. Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being. I miss him so."""
137,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,3,"This is a good book, it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Still, there is some very thought provoking material in this book. I was unaware that this is a compilation of various lectures & that might be why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought as I expected it to be a book specifically about the search for god & not extraterrestrials, nuclear war & how we as a species should go about this search & possibly act. It is a very good book with some great quotes taken from other authors or philosophers & information about the infancy of our species, our planet & our solar system. It will make you think deeply & critically about these questions & about understanding our place in the cosmos."
138,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409670-gofita,5,"I loved rereading this one. He was a wise man, full of insight. The world is smaller without him in it.Carl Sagan was a brilliant man. His lectures were thought-provoking and informative. He talks about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, life on our planet, our sustainability for the future when we have the power to destroy ourselves and most life on the planet. Just so many thoughts and ideas and science packed into this book. There is a Q&A section at the end on some of the questions others asked and he answered when he first gave the lectures, which is also fascinating.Recommended for anyone interested science, the cosmos, and just life in general."
139,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/820032-schuyler,4,"Who doesn't like Carl Sagan? I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't. Well, maybe some religious zealot. I always enjoy any opportunity to think about the ever-expanding universe. Sagan touches on all the cool stuff you want to talk about when talking about space, such as the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, the existence of God, and if the universe is ever-expanding, what is it expanding into? Huh? Answer me that! Some sort of Fourth Dimension!? Whoa. I think my brain just exploded. "
140,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55978446-miguel-ruiz,5,"Carl Sagan had the wonderful gift of explaining something rather complex in a language anyone could understand; though I admit, I am going to read this book a few more times in order to catch things that my perception wasn’t ready to comprehend in this first read through. I loved it! I particularly enjoyed the question and answer section at the end, the back and fort between Sagan and the audience was insightful."
141,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622527-shawn,4,"This is a compilation of Carl Sagan's Gifford lectures in Scotland in 1985, and they examine his ideas about god, religion and extra-terrestrial life. The stated goal of the lectures is to examine the relationship of science and spirituality.This is a wonderful thought-provoking book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is not a narrow-minded religious zealot."
142,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8754444-adam,5,"a remarkably humble, accessible and inspiring insight into the nature of the universe. Carl Sagan was a man who truly embodied the importance and virtue of science moving into a post-god world. His passion and love for science is wonderfully captured in these chapters, and made me feel a deep sense of remorse for my wilful resistance to physics and chemistry during my own schooling days. "

I wish I could have attended the original lectures, which happened long before my birth, but reading this collection of speeches is the next best thing. "
144,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119789-candace-morris,5,"So simple and digestible. I highly recommend to anyone exploring discrepancies in faith or curious about my spiritual path.

146,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988085-marije,4,Elegant and entertaining. 
147,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109504-clifford,4,A very interesting series of talks Sagan gave in 1985 that demonstrate the vastness of the universe and the implications of that vastness for religious systems.
148,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
149,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth.

I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"

This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely.

We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

We matter and we are matter - [ ] Drake equation - [ ] The largest uncertainty is the life time of a technical civilization - [ ] ‘We have imposed human values on the universe. . . if humans succeed in destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, a case can be made, that all the other animals are smarter than humans.- [ ] He takes a dig at human intelligence and reminds us of the folly of nuclear weapons - [ ] The answer to the Drake Equation ranges from we are the only civilization in the galaxy to the possibility of millions of other planets were there is life. If there is life nearby it could be cosmically close, a few hundred light years - [ ] What is certain is that if we are contacted by another civilization they are certainly fair more advanced than us. They will likely have technology and knowledge that we are unaware of. But if they wish to communicate with us then they will have to use what is to them, rudimentary technology. They would speak to us and we would listen, similar to how we interact with history, the great thinkers speak to us from the past and we listen- [ ] He goes on to dismiss ancient aliens and UFO sightings. He was part of a group that interviewed air force pilots that claimed to have seen/interacted with aliens/ufos - [ ] His commitment to skepticism is admirable, it is a profound act of faith/courage/humility. - [ ] ‘Carl did not want to believe, he wanted to know’ - Ann Druyan - [ ] If we are skeptical of a used car, we inspect the odometer, kick the tires, talk to the sales person, etc - shouldn’t we have the same thoroughness for the universe, god, religion, the origin of life, ethics, transcendence, principles, morals, our beliefs? - Thus science as a way of skeptically interrogating the universe - [ ] The God Hypothesis - [ ] It is foolish to deny the laws of nature. The laws of nature exist everywhere in the universe. The laws of nature are surely a power greater than ourselves. In a sense the laws of nature are a form of god- [ ] Christianity, Islam, Jewdism, have much more in common than any trivial differences - [ ] The world is vast yet we have a vast number is different religions and beliefs, they all represent their part of the world- [ ] He goes on to skeptically interrogate religions - [ ] He breaks down all of the arguments for god and concludes that none of them provide enough evidence to support the idea of a supreme being. He needs evidence. I admire his commitment but it’s a bit of a buzz kill. I don’t have his commitment to skepticism and the idea of there being no god terrifies me. For Sagan the truth was more important than fear. He wanted to know, not believe - [ ] It’s possible that the Buddhists believe that there god is so perfect that there is no need for that god to exist - [ ] Honestly I tune out during talk of refuting/disproving god. I believe in god and it is more in line with god of science/Buddhist ideas but I still believe and don’t have an interest in the proof/disproof of god - [ ] Interesting matrix/three options for god/the universe - [ ] There is no beginning and no end- [ ] There was a beginning but there is no end - [ ] There was no beginning but there is an end- [ ] The religious experience - [ ] Does prayer actually work - for those that believe in it, there seems to be a statistical correlation - [ ] Dominance hierarchies - [ ] Cultural anthropology - [ ] The opposite of a dominance hierarchy is democracy - [ ] Interesting section about the loose of innocence, our need for prayer as protection, Freudian psychology, projection of our psychology onto the cosmos - [ ] A section on the power and molecular effect of drugs, drugs are powerful and they are chemicals. Are all of our experiences just chemical changes? There are drugs in our brain that change how we feel, adrenal, dopamine, etc - [ ] The religious experience induced by LSD. Aw, humility, oneness with the universe, destruction of the ego- [ ] Fight or flight instinct - [ ] Very interesting section - [ ] Oooh shit he goes after those that seek to quell the masses through a promise of heaven and the after life!!!! I am gonna reread this section!!!- [ ] Powerful people that use religion/heaven to suppress others are the opposite of what he stands for. Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make? We made the wrong ones- [ ] He was talking about technology before the internet or smart phones, he never had an email. He would have been blown away- [ ] Great section about human survival and our extinction, classic Sagan- [ ] He compares what is happening now to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Does not reference climate change much, this is focused on nuclear weapons - [ ] He does acknowledge the positive aspects of religion, community, social organization, morality, positive social causes, story telling - [ ] He was well versed in religious texts and from what Sasha says in her book he did respect aspects of religion, practiced some traditions, and taught her about the stories and allegories - [ ] In many ways he expects more from religion and wanted faiths/leaders to do more positive and take a proactive moral lead in helping the world, in preventing nuclear war, caring for the poor, standing against atrocities, and caring for people/the planet - [ ] An alien visiting Earth may see what we are doing and see how foolish it is, they may decide to pass us by and move on to the next planet - [ ] What we are doing with nuclear weapons is terribly terribly foolish - [ ] We are at a turning point and we must make a decision about the direction of the species, destruction or survival - [ ] ‘In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how are we able to find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give fair hearing to everything, there is a world wide close mindedness that imperials the species’- [ ] I will listen and then write notes- [ ] We must broaden our views, seek diverse opinions/ideas - [ ] ‘The courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us’- [ ] We have an obligation to survive - [ ] He does not claim that we will survive just that we have the capability to survive, it is our choice on what we do - [ ] All governments lie to protect themselves and to stay in power. Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future. In a sense there is battle between good and evil. We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read. I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
158,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."
159,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97279304-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology. He recounts the story of The Fall. Not the biblical fall of some disobeying, naked, apple eating Adam and Eve but the Copernican fall from center of the universe to an ""uninteresting "" blue spot not even in the center of a galaxy that is a part of 100 billion other galaxies. And Lo ! He cast his wrath on the old superstitions. Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach. My favorite parts are his discussions of the arguments of natural theology: Cosmological, second law of thermodynamics, argument from design , from consciousness and the old ontological stuffs (I wouldn't call it an argument ). He drew many analogies between them and other extraterrestrial folklore stories.Nevertheless, the heart of this work is constructive: it is a message of openness, of the value of our rarity and the never ending search for meaning and truth. "
160,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

161,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."
162,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4500875-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology. He recounts the story of The Fall. Not the biblical fall of some disobeying, naked, apple eating Adam and Eve but the Copernican fall from center of the universe to an ""uninteresting "" blue spot not even in the center of a galaxy that is a part of 100 billion other galaxies. And Lo ! He cast his wrath on the old superstitions. Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach. My favorite parts are his discussions of the arguments of natural theology: Cosmological, second law of thermodynamics, argument from design , from consciousness and the old ontological stuffs (I wouldn't call it an argument ). He drew many analogies between them and other extraterrestrial folklore stories.Nevertheless, the heart of this work is constructive: it is a message of openness, of the value of our rarity and the never ending search for meaning and truth. "
163,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "
166,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38104-chad,4,"Carl Sagan was a truly amazing man, and this relatively brief and accessible collection of talks he presented when he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures back in 1985 is only one of many reasons why. Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

I was unaware that this is a compilation of various lectures & that might be why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought as I expected it to be a book specifically about the search for god & not extraterrestrials, nuclear war & how we as a species should go about this search & possibly act. It is a very good book with some great quotes taken from other authors or philosophers & information about the infancy of our species, our planet & our solar system.

He talks about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, life on our planet, our sustainability for the future when we have the power to destroy ourselves and most life on the planet. Just so many thoughts and ideas and science packed into this book. There is a Q&A section at the end on some of the questions others asked and he answered when he first gave the lectures, which is also fascinating.Recommended for anyone interested science, the cosmos, and just life in general."

I always enjoy any opportunity to think about the ever-expanding universe. Sagan touches on all the cool stuff you want to talk about when talking about space, such as the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, the existence of God, and if the universe is ever-expanding, what is it expanding into? Huh? Answer me that! Some sort of Fourth Dimension!? Whoa. I think my brain just exploded. "

177,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109504-clifford,4,A very interesting series of talks Sagan gave in 1985 that demonstrate the vastness of the universe and the implications of that vastness for religious systems.
178,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
179,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"
180,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"This is an easy-to-read summary of Carl Sagan's science and beliefs by Sagan himself, appearing as a transcript of nine lectures he gave in 1985. All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
181,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate.In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

We are narrow and anthropic in this view- [ ] ‘Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception’- [ ] The universe is mostly nothing ‘nothing is the rule, something/anything is the exception’- [ ] What is the chemical origin of life, carbon, proteins, etc - [ ] Humans have been on this planet for a fraction of a fraction of time, but life has existed for almost the entire history of the planet - [ ] The chances of life are astronomical small, yet it only took 500 million years for life to form on Earth - [ ] If we are just atoms does that make us less meaningful or does it make atoms more meaningful - [ ] Wow, just wow, the power of life, the chances of life, yet here we are existing. We matter and we are matter - [ ] Drake equation - [ ] The largest uncertainty is the life time of a technical civilization - [ ] ‘We have imposed human values on the universe. . . if humans succeed in destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, a case can be made, that all the other animals are smarter than humans.- [ ] He takes a dig at human intelligence and reminds us of the folly of nuclear weapons - [ ] The answer to the Drake Equation ranges from we are the only civilization in the galaxy to the possibility of millions of other planets were there is life. If there is life nearby it could be cosmically close, a few hundred light years - [ ] What is certain is that if we are contacted by another civilization they are certainly fair more advanced than us. They will likely have technology and knowledge that we are unaware of. But if they wish to communicate with us then they will have to use what is to them, rudimentary technology. They would speak to us and we would listen, similar to how we interact with history, the great thinkers speak to us from the past and we listen- [ ] He goes on to dismiss ancient aliens and UFO sightings. He was part of a group that interviewed air force pilots that claimed to have seen/interacted with aliens/ufos - [ ] His commitment to skepticism is admirable, it is a profound act of faith/courage/humility. - [ ] ‘Carl did not want to believe, he wanted to know’ - Ann Druyan - [ ] If we are skeptical of a used car, we inspect the odometer, kick the tires, talk to the sales person, etc - shouldn’t we have the same thoroughness for the universe, god, religion, the origin of life, ethics, transcendence, principles, morals, our beliefs? - Thus science as a way of skeptically interrogating the universe - [ ] The God Hypothesis - [ ] It is foolish to deny the laws of nature. The laws of nature exist everywhere in the universe. The laws of nature are surely a power greater than ourselves. In a sense the laws of nature are a form of god- [ ] Christianity, Islam, Jewdism, have much more in common than any trivial differences - [ ] The world is vast yet we have a vast number is different religions and beliefs, they all represent their part of the world- [ ] He goes on to skeptically interrogate religions - [ ] He breaks down all of the arguments for god and concludes that none of them provide enough evidence to support the idea of a supreme being. He needs evidence. I admire his commitment but it’s a bit of a buzz kill. I don’t have his commitment to skepticism and the idea of there being no god terrifies me. For Sagan the truth was more important than fear. He wanted to know, not believe - [ ] It’s possible that the Buddhists believe that there god is so perfect that there is no need for that god to exist - [ ] Honestly I tune out during talk of refuting/disproving god. I believe in god and it is more in line with god of science/Buddhist ideas but I still believe and don’t have an interest in the proof/disproof of god - [ ] Interesting matrix/three options for god/the universe - [ ] There is no beginning and no end- [ ] There was a beginning but there is no end - [ ] There was no beginning but there is an end- [ ] The religious experience - [ ] Does prayer actually work - for those that believe in it, there seems to be a statistical correlation - [ ] Dominance hierarchies - [ ] Cultural anthropology - [ ] The opposite of a dominance hierarchy is democracy - [ ] Interesting section about the loose of innocence, our need for prayer as protection, Freudian psychology, projection of our psychology onto the cosmos - [ ] A section on the power and molecular effect of drugs, drugs are powerful and they are chemicals. Are all of our experiences just chemical changes? There are drugs in our brain that change how we feel, adrenal, dopamine, etc - [ ] The religious experience induced by LSD. Aw, humility, oneness with the universe, destruction of the ego- [ ] Fight or flight instinct - [ ] Very interesting section - [ ] Oooh shit he goes after those that seek to quell the masses through a promise of heaven and the after life!!!! I am gonna reread this section!!!- [ ] Powerful people that use religion/heaven to suppress others are the opposite of what he stands for. Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make? We made the wrong ones- [ ] He was talking about technology before the internet or smart phones, he never had an email. He would have been blown away- [ ] Great section about human survival and our extinction, classic Sagan- [ ] He compares what is happening now to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Does not reference climate change much, this is focused on nuclear weapons - [ ] He does acknowledge the positive aspects of religion, community, social organization, morality, positive social causes, story telling - [ ] He was well versed in religious texts and from what Sasha says in her book he did respect aspects of religion, practiced some traditions, and taught her about the stories and allegories - [ ] In many ways he expects more from religion and wanted faiths/leaders to do more positive and take a proactive moral lead in helping the world, in preventing nuclear war, caring for the poor, standing against atrocities, and caring for people/the planet - [ ] An alien visiting Earth may see what we are doing and see how foolish it is, they may decide to pass us by and move on to the next planet - [ ] What we are doing with nuclear weapons is terribly terribly foolish - [ ] We are at a turning point and we must make a decision about the direction of the species, destruction or survival - [ ] ‘In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how are we able to find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give fair hearing to everything, there is a world wide close mindedness that imperials the species’- [ ] I will listen and then write notes- [ ] We must broaden our views, seek diverse opinions/ideas - [ ] ‘The courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us’- [ ] We have an obligation to survive - [ ] He does not claim that we will survive just that we have the capability to survive, it is our choice on what we do - [ ] All governments lie to protect themselves and to stay in power. Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future. In a sense there is battle between good and evil. We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read.

188,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."

190,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

191,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

193,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "

Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

208,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
209,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"
210,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"This is an easy-to-read summary of Carl Sagan's science and beliefs by Sagan himself, appearing as a transcript of nine lectures he gave in 1985.

This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
211,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is.

There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be .

217,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,5," The Varieties of Scientific Experience By Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan - [ ] I love Sagan and Druyan so much - [ ] The science as spirituality- [ ] Reject fundamentalism, embrace humanity and compassion - [ ] We are star dust, life is precious - [ ] This is absolutely beautiful - [ ] I am gonna try to limit the notes I write for this book because it will take me out of the experience of the book and it would just turn into a transcript of the book - [ ] A critically thoughtful citizenship - [ ] He treated those he disagreed with, with kindness and compassion - [ ] He agrees with William James’s definition of religion: the feeling of oneness with the universe I am gonna try and break up the reading of this so I can really absorb it and be mindful with it- [ ] An earth centric god is too small for him - [ ] ‘Humility is the only just response to the confrontation with the universe’ - - [ ] ‘I don’t need religion to make me feel god, I just need to look up’ - need to get the exact phrasing - [ ] ‘Science is at least in part, informed worship’- [ ] The anthropic principle - [ ] We only have a very small selection of data, one planet where there is life, we can not imagine the other possibilities of where there is life and how life started. We are narrow and anthropic in this view- [ ] ‘Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception’- [ ] The universe is mostly nothing ‘nothing is the rule, something/anything is the exception’- [ ] What is the chemical origin of life, carbon, proteins, etc - [ ] Humans have been on this planet for a fraction of a fraction of time, but life has existed for almost the entire history of the planet - [ ] The chances of life are astronomical small, yet it only took 500 million years for life to form on Earth - [ ] If we are just atoms does that make us less meaningful or does it make atoms more meaningful - [ ] Wow, just wow, the power of life, the chances of life, yet here we are existing. We matter and we are matter - [ ] Drake equation - [ ] The largest uncertainty is the life time of a technical civilization - [ ] ‘We have imposed human values on the universe. . . if humans succeed in destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, a case can be made, that all the other animals are smarter than humans.- [ ] He takes a dig at human intelligence and reminds us of the folly of nuclear weapons - [ ] The answer to the Drake Equation ranges from we are the only civilization in the galaxy to the possibility of millions of other planets were there is life. If there is life nearby it could be cosmically close, a few hundred light years - [ ] What is certain is that if we are contacted by another civilization they are certainly fair more advanced than us. They will likely have technology and knowledge that we are unaware of. But if they wish to communicate with us then they will have to use what is to them, rudimentary technology. They would speak to us and we would listen, similar to how we interact with history, the great thinkers speak to us from the past and we listen- [ ] He goes on to dismiss ancient aliens and UFO sightings. He was part of a group that interviewed air force pilots that claimed to have seen/interacted with aliens/ufos - [ ] His commitment to skepticism is admirable, it is a profound act of faith/courage/humility. - [ ] ‘Carl did not want to believe, he wanted to know’ - Ann Druyan - [ ] If we are skeptical of a used car, we inspect the odometer, kick the tires, talk to the sales person, etc - shouldn’t we have the same thoroughness for the universe, god, religion, the origin of life, ethics, transcendence, principles, morals, our beliefs? - Thus science as a way of skeptically interrogating the universe - [ ] The God Hypothesis - [ ] It is foolish to deny the laws of nature. The laws of nature exist everywhere in the universe. The laws of nature are surely a power greater than ourselves. In a sense the laws of nature are a form of god- [ ] Christianity, Islam, Jewdism, have much more in common than any trivial differences - [ ] The world is vast yet we have a vast number is different religions and beliefs, they all represent their part of the world- [ ] He goes on to skeptically interrogate religions - [ ] He breaks down all of the arguments for god and concludes that none of them provide enough evidence to support the idea of a supreme being. He needs evidence. I admire his commitment but it’s a bit of a buzz kill. I don’t have his commitment to skepticism and the idea of there being no god terrifies me. For Sagan the truth was more important than fear. He wanted to know, not believe - [ ] It’s possible that the Buddhists believe that there god is so perfect that there is no need for that god to exist - [ ] Honestly I tune out during talk of refuting/disproving god. I believe in god and it is more in line with god of science/Buddhist ideas but I still believe and don’t have an interest in the proof/disproof of god - [ ] Interesting matrix/three options for god/the universe - [ ] There is no beginning and no end- [ ] There was a beginning but there is no end - [ ] There was no beginning but there is an end- [ ] The religious experience - [ ] Does prayer actually work - for those that believe in it, there seems to be a statistical correlation - [ ] Dominance hierarchies - [ ] Cultural anthropology - [ ] The opposite of a dominance hierarchy is democracy - [ ] Interesting section about the loose of innocence, our need for prayer as protection, Freudian psychology, projection of our psychology onto the cosmos - [ ] A section on the power and molecular effect of drugs, drugs are powerful and they are chemicals. Are all of our experiences just chemical changes? There are drugs in our brain that change how we feel, adrenal, dopamine, etc - [ ] The religious experience induced by LSD. Aw, humility, oneness with the universe, destruction of the ego- [ ] Fight or flight instinct - [ ] Very interesting section - [ ] Oooh shit he goes after those that seek to quell the masses through a promise of heaven and the after life!!!! I am gonna reread this section!!!- [ ] Powerful people that use religion/heaven to suppress others are the opposite of what he stands for. Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make? We made the wrong ones- [ ] He was talking about technology before the internet or smart phones, he never had an email. He would have been blown away- [ ] Great section about human survival and our extinction, classic Sagan- [ ] He compares what is happening now to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Does not reference climate change much, this is focused on nuclear weapons - [ ] He does acknowledge the positive aspects of religion, community, social organization, morality, positive social causes, story telling - [ ] He was well versed in religious texts and from what Sasha says in her book he did respect aspects of religion, practiced some traditions, and taught her about the stories and allegories - [ ] In many ways he expects more from religion and wanted faiths/leaders to do more positive and take a proactive moral lead in helping the world, in preventing nuclear war, caring for the poor, standing against atrocities, and caring for people/the planet - [ ] An alien visiting Earth may see what we are doing and see how foolish it is, they may decide to pass us by and move on to the next planet - [ ] What we are doing with nuclear weapons is terribly terribly foolish - [ ] We are at a turning point and we must make a decision about the direction of the species, destruction or survival - [ ] ‘In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how are we able to find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give fair hearing to everything, there is a world wide close mindedness that imperials the species’- [ ] I will listen and then write notes- [ ] We must broaden our views, seek diverse opinions/ideas - [ ] ‘The courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us’- [ ] We have an obligation to survive - [ ] He does not claim that we will survive just that we have the capability to survive, it is our choice on what we do - [ ] All governments lie to protect themselves and to stay in power. Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future. In a sense there is battle between good and evil. We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read. I love Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan"
218,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."
219,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97279304-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology. He recounts the story of The Fall. Not the biblical fall of some disobeying, naked, apple eating Adam and Eve but the Copernican fall from center of the universe to an ""uninteresting "" blue spot not even in the center of a galaxy that is a part of 100 billion other galaxies. And Lo ! He cast his wrath on the old superstitions. Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach. My favorite parts are his discussions of the arguments of natural theology: Cosmological, second law of thermodynamics, argument from design , from consciousness and the old ontological stuffs (I wouldn't call it an argument ). He drew many analogies between them and other extraterrestrial folklore stories.Nevertheless, the heart of this work is constructive: it is a message of openness, of the value of our rarity and the never ending search for meaning and truth. "
220,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.  "
221,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

223,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2162407-rhesa,0,"I think all serious Christians must read this book, in my opinion, Sagan is a humble, honest & warm agnostic. This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "
224,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10484068-jim-lane,5,"It's hard to believe that over 20 years have gone by since my interest in astronomy was kindled by watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos series on PBS. Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."
225,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/231142-paul,5,"In the land of platitudes and prophets, here is the real thing: an American hero. How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "
226,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38104-chad,4,"Carl Sagan was a truly amazing man, and this relatively brief and accessible collection of talks he presented when he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures back in 1985 is only one of many reasons why. Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being. I miss him so."""
227,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,3,"This is a good book, it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Still, there is some very thought provoking material in this book. I was unaware that this is a compilation of various lectures & that might be why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought as I expected it to be a book specifically about the search for god & not extraterrestrials, nuclear war & how we as a species should go about this search & possibly act. It is a very good book with some great quotes taken from other authors or philosophers & information about the infancy of our species, our planet & our solar system.

His lectures were thought-provoking and informative. He talks about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, life on our planet, our sustainability for the future when we have the power to destroy ourselves and most life on the planet. Just so many thoughts and ideas and science packed into this book. There is a Q&A section at the end on some of the questions others asked and he answered when he first gave the lectures, which is also fascinating.Recommended for anyone interested science, the cosmos, and just life in general."

237,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109504-clifford,4,A very interesting series of talks Sagan gave in 1985 that demonstrate the vastness of the universe and the implications of that vastness for religious systems.
238,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
239,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"

All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely. Highly recommended to anyone just discovering Sagan, or to those wanting to be reminded of what he accomplished and stood for."
241,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation.

There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

He needs evidence. I admire his commitment but it’s a bit of a buzz kill. I don’t have his commitment to skepticism and the idea of there being no god terrifies me. For Sagan the truth was more important than fear. He wanted to know, not believe - [ ] It’s possible that the Buddhists believe that there god is so perfect that there is no need for that god to exist - [ ] Honestly I tune out during talk of refuting/disproving god.

Those that promise an eternal afterlife but keep the same people down while they are alive are terrible. These people have used power/authority/self interest to suppress people for thousands of years. They are against education, against science, against free express, and against the collective. They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make?

248,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."
249,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97279304-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology.

Not Richard Dawkins kind of wrath, but if I dare say, his subtle discussions are more nuanced and thus far-reaching than the Dawkins ""backfire effect triggering""approach.

250,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

251,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

How tragic they we need to resort to Sagan's 1985 Gifford Lectures for a sober analysis of man's continual search (and redefinition) of his place in the universe. Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "

Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

It is a very good book with some great quotes taken from other authors or philosophers & information about the infancy of our species, our planet & our solar system.

267,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109504-clifford,4,A very interesting series of talks Sagan gave in 1985 that demonstrate the vastness of the universe and the implications of that vastness for religious systems.
268,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
269,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"

All of his significant areas of interest are represented: the exploration of the planets, his philosophy of science, evidence for evolution, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the meaning and relevance of gods, purposes of religion, global warming, and the nuclear arms race. This material appears in his many other books in other forms and in more depth but is presented here concisely.

271,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,5,"A gentle exposition on a religious/scientific outlook similar to Einstein's.___Carl never understood why anyone would want to separate science, which is just a way of searching for what is true, from what we hold sacred, which are those truths that inspire love and awe.I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god. We would be unappreciative of those gifts if we suppressed our passion to explore the universe and ourselves. On the other hand, if such a god does not exist, then our curiosity and intelligenceare essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is consistent surely with science; it should be with religion, and it is essential for the welfare of the human species.I think that the only sense that can be put on the phrase ""made in God's image"" is that there is a sense of intellectual affinity between us and higher organisms, if such there be.The search for extraterrestrial life is one of those few circumstances where both a success and a failure would be a success by all standards.Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie?It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day, but it is nothing strange that men should lie in all ages.The Romans called Christians atheists, because the Christians had a god of sorts, but it wasn't a real god. They didn't believe in the divinity of apotheosized emperors or Olympian gods.The general sense is that an atheist is anybody who doesn't believe exactly as I do prevails in our own time.How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.The intervention of God in human affairs speaks of incompetence. And not incompetence on a human scale. Clearly all of the views of God are much more competent than the most competent human. But it does not speak of omni-competence. It says that there are limitations.Why should God be so clear in the Bible and so obscure in the world?Prescott's multivariant analysis throws up the key distinction having to do with whether cultures hug their children and whether they permit pre-marital sexual activity amongst adolescents. And he concludes that all cultures in which the children are hugged and the teenagers can have sex wind up without powerful social hierarchies and everybody's happy. But there isn't necessarily a causal sequence.The nature of the religious experience has a uniform aspect of an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. That sounds to me like a dominance-hierarchy molecule, or part of a suite of molecules to suit us for the quest to find somebody to worship.Now what's the good of that? If for no other reason, it would produce social conformity, or, put in more favourable terms, it would ensure social stability and morality.Far be from us the dangerous maxim that it is sometimes useful to mislead, to deceive, and enslave mankind to ensure their happiness.Religion can remind us of unpopular truths. Religion can speak truth to power.It's a very important function that is often not carried out by all the other sectors of society.Should not those who make conspicuous public displays of their devotion to Christianity follow what is certainly among the central tenets of the faith?When you look at the Earth from space, it is striking. There are no national boundaries visible. They have been put there, like the equator and the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, by humans.Many species have varying degrees of intelligence. But it is our intelligence, our interest in figuring things out, our ability to do so, coupled with our manipulative abilities, our engineering talents- that is responsible for our success.Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I might have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realisation.

There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.I think it is striking how poorly religions, by and large, have accommodated to the astonishing truths that have emerged in the last few centuries.a courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it, but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us.Two poles of the definition of God. One is the view of, say, Spinoza or Einstein, which is more or less God as the sum total of the laws of physics. Purpose is not imposed from the outside, it is generated from the inside. We make our purpose. And there is a kind of dereliction of duty of us humans when we say that the purpose is to be imposed on the outside or found in some book written thousands of years ago. We live in a very different world than we lived in thousands of years ago.Its a sign of their (extraterrestrials) intelligence that they haven't come (I'm just joking). But it is a sobering fact that our mainly mindless television transmissions are our principal emissaries to the stars. There is an aspect of self-knowledge that this implies that I think would be very good for us to come to grips with.The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be . It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy."

They stand against everything that Sagan stands for.- [ ] These lectures were given in ‘85 and he goes hard at the religious/political justification of Apartheid - [ ] Once he starts on this section it brought a smile to my face: the thought of a preacher telling Sagan or anyone that they should be moral on Earth but tithe and be loyal to a clearly corrupt/manipulative/lying/selfish church/authority in the false promise of a glorious eternal afterlife, while the powerful live in luxury and suppress ideas/people and those people live in poverty and are killed/tortured/raped, is truly the antithesis of everything that Sagan stood for - [ ] Sagan believed in free societies, education, transparency, compassion, respect, freedom, autonomy, and spiritual connection to science and the truth - [ ] There is a great line about how religion support the horrible such as slavery/apartheid/etc to protect them and the powerful but never stand up for the less fortunate/those they preach to/anything that challenges their authority - [ ] Nuclear weapons and nuclear winter - [ ] We have an obligation to survive, the pale blue dot ideas in action - [ ] We are at a turning point, what choices will we make? We made the wrong ones- [ ] He was talking about technology before the internet or smart phones, he never had an email. He would have been blown away- [ ] Great section about human survival and our extinction, classic Sagan- [ ] He compares what is happening now to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Does not reference climate change much, this is focused on nuclear weapons - [ ] He does acknowledge the positive aspects of religion, community, social organization, morality, positive social causes, story telling - [ ] He was well versed in religious texts and from what Sasha says in her book he did respect aspects of religion, practiced some traditions, and taught her about the stories and allegories - [ ] In many ways he expects more from religion and wanted faiths/leaders to do more positive and take a proactive moral lead in helping the world, in preventing nuclear war, caring for the poor, standing against atrocities, and caring for people/the planet - [ ] An alien visiting Earth may see what we are doing and see how foolish it is, they may decide to pass us by and move on to the next planet - [ ] What we are doing with nuclear weapons is terribly terribly foolish - [ ] We are at a turning point and we must make a decision about the direction of the species, destruction or survival - [ ] ‘In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how are we able to find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and give fair hearing to everything, there is a world wide close mindedness that imperials the species’- [ ] I will listen and then write notes- [ ] We must broaden our views, seek diverse opinions/ideas - [ ] ‘The courageous intent to greet the universe as it really is, not to foist our emotional predispositions on it but to courageously accept what our explorations tell us’- [ ] We have an obligation to survive - [ ] He does not claim that we will survive just that we have the capability to survive, it is our choice on what we do - [ ] All governments lie to protect themselves and to stay in power. Governments lie. It is our responsibility to question our governments and to be strong democratic active citizens (fucking beautiful) - [ ] We all have felt compassion/love and we have felt anger, it is our choice on which we as humans choose and where we go in the future. In a sense there is battle between good and evil. We have the capability to move forward and to survive, will we?- [ ] Ann says in the epilogue that ‘shadows of forgotten ancestors’ was Carl’s favorite book that they wrote I was a bit disappointed with this book, I was hoping for more of an ode to science that is in ‘demon haunted world’ but never the less it was a fun and enjoyable read.

278,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,4,"The Gifford Lectures hold this excessively sublimated and sacred place in my head, and so I was really excited to learn that Sagan had the opportunity to deliver the Gifford Lectures in 1985, and it was available in book format. Lots of the more recent Gifford Lectures are freely available to the public as YouTube videos, which is really neat, and I've enjoyed a some by Sarah Coakley, Jean-Luc Marion, Bruno Latour, Rowan Williams, and Kathryn Tanner. And of course I've read a little of William James' famous book, ""The Varieties of Religious Experience"" (actually on recommendation by Marcus Borg), which began as a set of Gifford Lectures, and after which this Sagan book was named. (James’ book is freely available in audiobook format on Librivox.)The synopsis/description on the back of the book situates Sagan among great contemporary popular science writers like Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould. This is the only work of Sagan's I've read, so I can't make any blanket statements regarding him, but I've found both Sachs and Gould personally more enjoyable than Sagan, at least here in these lectures. It maybe has something to do with Sagan's directness that seems to circumvent any eloquence or nuance, by which I enjoy both Gould and Sachs a good deal more. However, I have great admiration for Sagan as a person and scientist, and I always associate him in my head with people Tao Lin and Terrence McKenna, both of whom I like quite a bit. Overall however, despite thinking Sagan's critiques of Christianity and religion to be both valid and necessary, I thought they were framed and expressed in a way that was at times slightly irritating.While I wouldn't cluster Sagan with the New Atheist fundamentalists like Hitchens or Dawkins, he sometimes speaks in a similar tone that sounds slightly patronizing, condescending, or sarcastic. ""A man in the sky with a beard"" is a sarcastic conception of God, because I don't believe I've met anyone who believes in such a God. Sagan will usually spend quite a lot of time critiquing very stereotypical forms of faith and than work his way out to the fringes later on, before quickly moving on.For example, in speaking of a hypothetical “molecule that produces a religious experience” Sagan asks, “what is the nature of the experience?” and then answers, “The nature of the experience has, as I say, many different aspects. But one uniform aspect of it is an intense feeling of awe and humility before a power vastly greater than ourselves. And that sounds to me very much like a dominance-hierarchy molecule or part of a suite of molecules whose function it is to fit us into the dominance hierarchies—to suit us for the quest that was, according to Dostoyevsky, to strive for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship and obey.”This is very telling of Sagan’s conception of religion, resembling Marx’s claim that religion was the “opiate of the masses”, but at least Marx’s metaphor still possessed the positive dimension of solace and relief from suffering. I in some sense agree with the Dostoyevsky reference Sagan makes, but I would claim that this striving to find someone (or something) to worship and obey functions both consciously and unconsciously, and even functioned in the life of Sagan, who certainly had a liturgical practice shaped by scientific methodology and worshiped some type of Reason and sought the face of some more fundamental and elegant equation of Nature.But Sagan, I think, saw religion largely as a pacifying force to fit people into dominance hierarchies. I can only speak from a Christian view, but I’m sure there are equally compelling analogues in other faiths, but in the Christian faith tradition, God became human then died as a victim of imperial violence and this ""weakness of God"" (Paul's language) was considered greater than the ""strength of humankind"", and ultimately for Christians reframed what power was. And furthermore God’s power, which Christians affirm, acts as a negating force against the powers that be (a force to dismantle dominance hierarchies), not as a pacifying force to fit people into existing dominance hierarchies (which admittedly has been done for the majority of Christian history). If one actually reads the scriptural texts, there’s plenty of material that moves in the direction of liberation and equality rather than hierarchy and dominance. There’s of course texts that can be read in a way that pushes in the direction of dominance hierarchies, since the bible, as I see it, is like a courtroom with many competing testimonies at times in tension with one another. However, I think the texts espousing dominance hierarchies are scarcer and far less compelling, because they do not support the larger narrative of liberation, which is at the heart of both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian canon. Sagan does go into this liberatory aspect of faith later on, describing Christians who were trying to bring an end to South African apartheid or others who worked in the civil rights movement, but they were mentioned very briefly in passing, feeling more like an afterthought.Earlier in the lectures Sagan's remarks seemed more directed towards fundamentalists than some more thoughtful and nuanced people of faith. In general, Sagan seems to me still caught up within the conversations that unfolded in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. It sometimes felt like I was sitting at one more debate between a Christian apologist and some atheist or agnostic, and admittedly, I don’t find that stuff very interesting. Often exchanges like these remain within the sort of terrain that Bonhoeffer was lamenting when he spoke of this ""God of the gaps"", saying:""how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.""The reason I enjoyed Paul Tillich so much when I discovered him (I was largely compelled to read him after skimming through Martin Luther King Jr’s doctoral dissertation), is that Tillich is not that hung up on whether ""God exists"". The question, “Does God exist?” is maybe too big a question. Sagan shows why this is so by elaborating on how immense the range of definitions there are for God and how variously the word 'God' is used, but he never went into the complexities of what it means to “exist”, which is another fundamental problem with that question, ""does God exist?"" Sagan mentions Tillich only very quickly in passing:“the subject is further confused by the fact that prominent theologians such as Paul Tillich, for example, who gave the Gifford Lectures many years ago, explicitly denied God’s existence, at least as a supernatural power. Well, if an esteemed theologian (and he’s by no means the only one) denies that God is a supernatural being, the subject seems to me to be somewhat confused.”Tillich, in the Dynamics of Faith, wrote:“faith, understood as the state of being ultimately concerned, has no language other than symbols. When saying this I always expect the question: Only a symbol? He who asks this question shows that he has not understood the difference between signs and symbols nor the power of symbolic language, which surpasses in quality and strength the power of any nonsymbolic language. One should never say “only a symbol,” but one should say “not less than a symbol.” With this in mind we can now describe the different kinds of symbols of faith. The fundamental symbol of our ultimate concern is God. It is always present in any act of faith, even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. “Sagan is someone for whom I imagine Tillich's ""only a symbol?” was meant for. Sagan seems to have little patience for anything too rich or saturated to be confined by the criteria of scientific empiricism. Maybe I don't know enough about this to properly comment, but a lot of 20th-century atheists who grew up in fundamentalist or religiously conservative households appear to reflect what seems to me like a regression in atheist thought. To me, Zizek's atheism, which makes space for God in the symbolic order, and asserts that the symbolic order is indispensably important to thoughtful 21st-century discourse, is a far more compelling sort atheism. A lot of more recent atheism seems content to show only the absence of any metaphysical God, yet ignores the fact that billions of people continue to 'experience' something which they refer to as God, regardless of what atheists/agnostics like Sagan believe and try to tell them. And what are you going to do about that, especially when people's notions of God are particularly self-destructive (like Sagan talks about with respect to some fundamentalist Christians who welcome nuclear annihilation as the predicted apocalypse in the Bible).Sagan appears fairly uninterested in phenomenology and the subjective experience of faith practice outside reductionist domains like biochemistry or neuroscience, despite the fact William James spent so much time in the realm of a science as soft as psychology. The Husserlian observation of phenomenology, that remains alive in continental philosophical discourse today, has rightly in my opinion focused questions on subjective phenomenological experience. Whether something like God metaphysically exists hardly matters if many people experience what they collectively refer to as 'God'. Martin Nowak, the Catholic Harvard biologist, made a remark that he found theology very similar to abstract mathematics, which often had no physical corollaries, but demanded some type of internal consistency or coherence. (Sagan doesn’t really touch on this though.) Similarly, Yuval Noah Harari's category of the 'intersubjective' places things like corporations, the law, nations, the World Bank within the same category as God, and I think that's a far more sensible atheist position to espouse, because it does not get stuck in this less interesting question of ""does God exist or not?"" (which categories like theist, atheist, agnostic all hinge upon). Can you imagine if all economists talked about was whether the World Bank existed or not? Or if lawyers just argued all day if ""the law"" really exists in a metaphysical way or not. Or Canadians spent all their time arguing over whether ""Canada"" exists, rather than addressing issues of indigenous marginalization.Tillich invited us to move onto far more important questions like what do particular conceptions of God or particular orientations of theological hermeneutics mean for social, economic, and environmental justice and equality. And I believe Sagan cared about all these things a lot more than whether God existed, and the strategy of trying to move people to confess agnosticism and atheism is a far more arduous task in my opinion than trying to flag concerns about social, political, economic, and environmental issues in theologically compelling ways to people of faith. I think atheists should engage in theology beyond boring and rather old arguments about why God does not exist. Hopefully Christians can get beyond that question too.I think some of the most compelling theology I've encountered have been from so-called 'narrative theology' as well as rhetorical criticism. Brueggemann's emphasis on the prophetic imagination has become such a vital lens by which I understand and practice faith. The bible is not a scientific nor even really a historical text (at least in the way we understand science and history today). But it’s fairly clear that it’s a very literary and poetic book, and the fact that Sagan doesn’t really talk about the poetic dimensions of religion as it intersects with science, is one of the shortcomings of this lecture series, for me. My critiques of Sagan are a little unfair, because he was supposed to talk about the intersection of science and religion, and poetry doesn’t afford as much space as other angles on religion, though I think phenomenology does in some sense. I think theologians like Sarah Coakley, or academics like Mary-Jane Rubinstein, who both take science very seriously, would have been really great interlocutors to move the conversation into territory that I personally would have found more interesting. It’s too bad it took so long to let women into the academy in more adequate proportions (though there's more work to be done there still).Even after all this complaining, I think this was still a great book, and interesting — though I’ve encountered a lot of the material on religion before. I feel Sagan's strengths lie more on explaining science than religion. I also think his lecture that focused on nuclear war was some of the most interesting material for me, and certainly something very relevant considering the climate of international relations today."
279,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97279304-joseph-hellion,5,"Carl Sagan descended from the mountain of scientific abstractions with the tablets of scientific methodology.

280,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171788-robert-lomas,5,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was both surprised and pleased to see part of Carl Sagan's unpublished archive had made it into the public domain. The work is a series of transcripts of a series of Gifford lectures, on the topic of natural theology, which Sagan delivered in Glasgow during 1985. The style of the book is different from those such as Cosmos of Contact which he deliberately prepared for written publication, as in this case the text is transcribed from his verbal presentations in public lectures and includes his impromptu responses to unscripted questions.The end results, sensitively edited by Ann Druyan, is a delightful opportunity to experience the rhetorical skill, and depth of thinking, of a man who had been brought up a Jew, had a great respect of the pervasive sense of order he discovered through his telescopes and remote controlled space craft and was genuinely opened minded about the root causes of reality. The lecture topics begin with the sense of wonder which anyone can feel by looking out into the heavens on a clear night, move on discuss the place of humanity in the universe and then discuss the origins and probability of the emergence of life. Having established a foundation of the cosmos humanity inhibits Sagan's next lecture begins to pose the question ""Are we alone?"". He looks at the possibility of discovering and communicating with any intelligences which might have developed elsewhere in the universe, and whether any such contact has already taken place. Next his lectures move on to discuss the nature of the concept of God, and whether either human religious experiences or science can offer any insights. His penultimate lecture looks human condition and humanity's future prospects. He makes a strong case for the need to learn to love our fellow humans and to learn how to cooperate with individuals whose views we do not accept, it we as a species are to survive long-term. He makes the powerful point, in discussing the potential destructive power of humanity, that such cooperation is not needed to save the planet, as he comments ""Whatever the causes that divide us (humanity)... it is clear that the Earth will be here a thousand or a million years from now. The question, the key question, the central question - in a certain sense the only question - is, will we?"" The final lecture is an inspirational exhortation to use the skills of science, the insights of religion and the common cause of all earthlings to make the most of a tiny, island of life.The book is a wonderful inspirational read. It shows the strength of science method, the motivational urge of religion and urges all humanity to realise how unusual or ""pale blue dot"" of a home is and how we should all try to take care of it.

281,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I used to work with a woman who thought Carl Sagan was the bee's knees. She even had her students create their own document to launch into the universe (the launch was not literal). Thinking of her, I decided to look into Carl Sagan and Varieties of Scientific Experience was the first book that I found at the library.There are two best parts.The first best part is the opening, which focus on the size and scope of the universe. It's written in a way that's entirely understandable, but I found it mind-bending. It's not so difficult to achieve this effect. Look into the size of our planet, then our star, and then the largest stars in our galaxy. And then consider that our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. How small our individual concerns suddenly become. I think you can google image search this effect now, but back in the day, I suppose we relied on astronomers' lectures and the planetarium for these thoughts.The second best part is the Q&A.Here's one exchange:Question: I'm one of those who lives with one foot on each side of life. One foot on the psychic and a very practical other foot, as a businesswoman, on the world. I've proved it.CS: What in general should we do in a dialogue like this? Here I am. I say that my mind is open. I am happy to see the evidence, and the response I sometimes get is, ""I've had this experience. It's compelling to me. But I can't give it over to you."" Now, doesn't that prevent any dialogue whatever? How are we to communicate?This excerpt might seem a little one-sided. If you read the book, it's hard not to view Sagan as incredibly open-minded and patient.Much of this book can be read as an analysis of existence of God arguments. I found it interesting to note that unlike debates over creationism and evolution, this text looked at astronomical time (billions of years), geological time (billions of years), fossil record (the fossils are found where they are expected to be), geographic experiences (Catholics might claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary, for example, but such visions are rarely reported by Hindus in India), and then extra-terrestrial life. Do such beings exist? Could they have visited our planet, and what would be an acceptable proof? And could have been mistaken for gods (or a god)?Recommended."

This book is derived from his Gifford lecture. Here he explains & argues why science finds it hard to believe in a personal benevolant God. For him, if God is defined as the governing order of the universe, which is the law of astrophysics, then He will bow his head in adoration. I find this book stimulating, it delivers a deep looking into the universe and then forming ideas about Creator God. We can`t have objection of such method, because King David himself employed this particular technique when he said `the heavens declares his majestyThis book also includes the question & answer session between sagan and his listeners after he finished his lecture. I want that my faith also be in the same form like Sagan`s definition of religion which is `an informed worship`. "

Many of his ideas and viewpoints concerning modern man's threat to the environment due to global warming and to our species continued existence by nuclear or biological warfare seem prophetic.I think the most interesting idea presented in this book is that science and religion do not necessarily have to be in conflict. If the major religions of the world evolved to better serve the needs of life in the 21st Century, we may have a better chance of eliminating violence and suffering on this planet and also avoid self-extinction.Just think if Carl Sagan were still alive today and the political and religious leaders of the world were willing to listen to his clear voice of reason."

Avoiding the distracting (although admittedly funny) polemics of the ""New Atheists"" Sagan wrestles with God and green men alike, considering the likelihood of each with the same equanimity that he gives to all natural phenomena. No, it's not his most ambitious or encompassing work. Yes, there are dated references to our ""Cold War"" past (though we are deluding ourselves if we think his threats of nuclear annihilation are not pertinent). Even with these weaknesses in mind, his message remains essential. Read this book. "

Though he's been dead for over 10 years now - and these speeches themselves are more than 20 years old at this point - he still seems light years ahead of so many of us, scientifically, intellectually, and spiritually. He makes you feel amazed just to be alive, to be a part of such a vast universe, and never stops encouraging all of us to search for our own answers to this life.Or, as Kurt Vonnegut's book jacket blurb puts it: ""Find here a major fraction of this stunningly valuable legacy left to all of us by a great human being.

298,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri,3,"Three and a half stars. This was an interesting book to be my first by Carl Sagan, because it's actually transcripts of lectures, including some Q&A with the audience. So it's more intimate, in a way, because you can hear him speaking; it's very coherent, obviously, but just not structured exactly the same way it would've been if he'd written it for publication. And the sense I got (which I think I already knew) is that I really like Carl Sagan. He's so thoughtful and gentle in his responses to the audience, even when I imagined that he was annoyed by the questions. But surely there is a message in the heavens that the finiteness not just of life but of whole worlds, in fact of whole galaxies, is a bit antithetical to the conventional theological views in the West, although not in the East. And this then suggests a broader conclusion. And that is the idea of an immortal Creator. By definition, as Ann Druyan has pointed out, an immortal Creator is a cruel god, because He, never having to face the fear of death, creates innumerable creatures who do. Why should He do that? . . . It's a little bit like the rich imposing poverty on the poor and then asking to be loved because of it. ____Does trying to understand the universe at all betray a lack of humility? I believe it is true that humility is the only just response in a confrontation with the universe, but not a humility that prevents us from seeking the nature of the universe we are admiring. If we seek that nature, then love can be informed by truth instead of being based on ignorance of self-deception. If a Creator God exists, would He or She or It or whatever the appropriate pronoun is, prefer a kind of sodden blockhead who worships while understanding nothing? Or would He prefer His votaries to admire the real universe in all its intricacy? I would suggest that science is, at least in part, informed worship. My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, then our curiosity and intelligence are provided by such a god . . . On the other hand, if such a traditional god does not exist, then our curiosity and our intelligence are the essential tools for managing our survival in an extremely dangerous time.___I thought this was incredibly cool; it's a way to visualize the time frame of evolution, because he says one of the things people struggle with is that the scale is too large for us to get a sense of:Suppose your father or mother—let's say father for the sake of definiteness—walked into this room at the ordinary human pace of walking. And suppose just behind him was his father. And just behind him was his father. How long would we have to wait before the ancestor who enters the now-open door is a creature who normally walked on all fours? The answer is a week.Can you imagine that? A full week of a constant stream of people walking through the door, and each one of those ancestors represents a generation? The amount of time represented here is huge on a human scale. If that was one person every three seconds, we're talking about 200,000 people, each one representing about twenty years.___Now, it is sometimes said that people who take a skeptical approach to UFOs or ancient astronauts or indeed some varieties of revealed religion are engaging in prejudice. I maintain this is not prejudice. It is postjudice. That is, not a judgment made before examining the evidence but a judgment made after examining the evidence.___Sagan quotes David Hume: ""In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And then when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitudes, the season is now past and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery."" And then says himself:Well, it seems to me that there is only one conceivable approach to these matters. If we have such an emotional stake in the answers, if we want badly to believe, and if it is important to know the truth, then nothing other than a committed, skeptical scrutiny is required. It is not very different from buying a used car. When you buy a used car, it is insufficient to remember that you badly need a car. After all, it has to work. It is insufficient to say that the used-car salesman is a friendly fellow. What you generally do is you kick the tires, you look at the odometer, you open up the hood. If you do not feel yourself expert in automobile engines, you bring a friend who is. And you do this for something as unimportant as an automobile. But on issues of the transcendent, of ethics and morals, of the origin of the world, of the nature of human beings, on those issues should we not insist upon at least equally skeptical scrutiny?___One thing that comes to my mind is how striking it is that when someone has a religious-conversion experience, it is almost always to the religion or one of the religions that are mainly believed in his or her community. Because there are so many other possibilities. For example, it's very rare in the West that someone has a religious-conversion experience in which the principal deity has the head of an elephant and is painted blue. That is quite rare. But in India there is a blue, elephant-headed god that has many devotees. And seeing depictions of this god there is not so rare. How is it that the apparition of elephant gods is restricted to Indians and doesn't happen except in places where there is a strong Indian tradition? How is it that apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in the West but rarely occur in places in the East where there isn't a strong Christian tradition? Why don't the details of the religious belief cross over the cultural barriers? It is hard to explain unless the details are entirely determined by the local culture and have nothing to do with something that is externally valid.___Now, whether or not this explanation is right, there is no question that religions have historically played the role of making people contented with their lot. And it is customary even today to argue that the actual truth or falsity of the religious doctrine does not matter so much as the degree of social stability it brings about. People who through no fault of their own have much less in the way of material goods or respect in a society are told in many religions, ""It doesn't matter in this life. Yeah, it looks like you're getting a bad deal, but this is just the twinkling of an eye. What really matters is the next life, and there an implacable cosmic justice awaits you."" . . . Maybe it's true. But it's not hard to see that such a doctrine would be very appealing to the ruling classes of a society.___Tradition is a precious thing, a kind of distillation of tens or hundreds of thousands of generations of humans. It is a gift from our ancestors. But it is essential to remember that tradition is invented by human beings and for perfectly pragmatic reasons. If instead you believe that the traditions are from an exhortatory god and hold that the traditional wisdom is handed down directly from a deity, then we are much scandalized at the idea of challenging the conventions. But when the world is changing very fast, I suggest survival may depend precisely on our ability to change rapidly in the face of changing conditions. We live in precisely such a time.Consider our past circumstances. Imagine our ancestors, a small, itinerant, nomadic group of hunter-gatherer people. Surely there was change in their lives . . . But by and large the change is extraordinarily slow. The same traditions for chipping stone to make spears and arrowheads, for example, continues in the East African paleoanthropological sites for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.In such a society, the external change was slow compared to the human generation time. Back then traditional wisdom, parental prescriptions, were perfectly valid and appropriate for generations. Children growing up of course paid the closest attention to these traditions, because they represented a kind of elixir of the wisdom of previous generations; it was constantly tested, and it constantly worked . . . Now compare that with another reality, one in which the external changes, social or biological or climatic or whatever we wish, are rapid compared to a human generation time. Then parental wisdom may not be relevant to present circumstances. Then what we ourselves were taught and learned as youngsters may have dubious relevance to the circumstances of the day. Then there is a kind of intergenerational conflict.___This next quote comes twenty pages later, in a different chapter, so I'm surprised by how seamlessly it seems to be directly related to the one I just finished typing. These lectures were given in 1985, so the ""extraordinary times"" he refers to frequently throughout them are referring to the arms race and the threat of nuclear war. That particular version of the crisis has ended, but I have to say going into 2017 that these words still feel incredibly relevant to me.Since the times are so extraordinary, since they are unprecedented, it is in no way clear that the ancient prescriptions retain perfect validity today. That means that we must have a willingness to consider a wide variety of new alternatives, some of which have never been thought of before, others of which have, but have been summarily rejected by one culture or another. We run the danger of fighting to the death on ideological pretexts.We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can't convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview I have dedicated my life to is inadequate . . . Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, needs practice to be perfected . . . There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren't as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.We have Ten Commandments in the West. Why is there no commandment exhorting us to learn? ""Thou shalt understand the world. Figure things out."" There's nothing like that. And very few religions urge us to enhance our understanding of the natural world.___From the question and answer section, in which an audience member suggested that ""in reality He is there. God is love.""Well, if we say that the definition of God is reality, or the definition of God is love, I have no quarrel with the existence of reality or the existence of love . . . However, it does not follow that God defined in that way has anything to do with the creation of the world or of any events in human history. It does not follow that there's anything that is omnipotent or omniscient and so on about God defined in such a manner. So all I'm saying is, we must look at the logical consistency of the various definitions. If you say God is love, clearly love exists in the world. But love is not the only thing that exists in the world . . . And I don't see that it helps to say, forgive me, that God is love, because there are all those other definitions of God, that mean quite different things. If we muddle up all the definitions of God, then it's very confusing what's being talked about. There is a great opportunity for error in that case. So my proposal is that we call reality ""reality,"" that we call love ""love,"" and not call either of them God, which has, while an enormous number of other meanings, not exactly those meanings.He is being kind there, but I think what he means—and what I believe—is that if we're being perfectly honest, when people do this, they are (whether consciously or not) trying to obscure the issue precisely so that it is confusing what we're talking about. Because really, the only thing religion has going for it is the fact that we can't disprove it.___Questioner: How do you recognize the truth when it is upon us?CS: A simple question: How can we recognize the truth? It is, of course, difficult. But there are a few simple rules. The truth ought to be logically consistent. It should not contradict itself; that is, there are some logical criteria. It ought to be consistent with what else we know . . . We should also pay attention to how badly we want to believe a given contention. The more badly we want to believe it, the more skeptical we have to be. It involves a kind of courageous self-discipline. Nobody says it's easy. I think those three principles at least will winnow out a fair amount of chaff. It doesn't guarantee that what remains will be true, but at least it will significantly diminish the field of discourse.___Questioner: Professor, Sagan, I'd like advice, please. Is there anything you think an individual could do to change in some way the world situation, or should we just sit back and accept it?CS: Nope, you don't have to sit back. [First he says some things about democracy, voting for candidates who have rational views on things, writing letters to newspapers, etc.] But more important than any of that, I believe, is that each of us must equip him- or herself with a ""baloney-detection kit"" . . . I would say that the first thing to do is to realize that governments, all governments, at least on occasion, lie . . . By and large, governments distort the facts in order to remain in office. And if we are ignorant of what the issues are and can't even ask the critical questions, then we're not going to make much of a difference. If we can understand the issues, if we can pose the right questions, if we can point out the contradictions, then we can make some progress.___Everyone in this room has felt aggression. Surely that's right . . . But I also maintain that everyone in this room has felt compassion. Everyone in this room has felt love. Everyone in this room has felt kindness. And so we have two warring principles in the human heart, both of which must have evolved by natural selection, and it's not hard to understand the selective advantage of both of them. And so the issue has to do with which is in the preponderance. And here it is the use of our intellect that is central. Because we're talking about adjudicating between conflicting emotions. And you can't have an adjudication between emotions by an emotion. It must be done by our perceptive intellectual ability."
299,1594201072,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084837-mike,5,"I'm quite astounded by this book. Carl Sagan has something so unique in his scientific perspective that really sets him far apart from others in the ""new atheist"" movement. He approaches the universe with wonder and curiosity, admitting what he doesn't and cannot know, and seeks compassion and tries to find agreement where he can with those who believe in a higher power. But at the same time he doesn't shy away from pointing out the flaws in religious thinking throughout history, no matter what ideology it may be.In a part of these talks, he seeks to find positive examples of times religion has played an important role in confronting power, and encourages us to align with the best examples in those traditions. He doesn't talk down to believers in a higher power, he only encourages turning a critical eye toward our beliefs: Think rationally, question your assumptions, take special care to analyze the basis of your most emotionally-driven beliefs. But also take awe of the beauty and magnitude of the universe, our place in the cosmos, and the challenges we face as a species if we hope to survive extinction.Even the question and answer sessions for each chapter display how incredibly brilliant and surprising Carl Sagan can be. He's truly a hero of mine.A great excerpt:“We kill each other, or threaten to kill each other, in part, I think, because we are afraid we might not ourselves know the truth, that someone else with a different doctrine might have a closer approximation to the truth. Our history is in part a battle to the death of inadequate myths. If I can’t convince you, I must kill you. That will change your mind. You are a threat to my version of the truth, especially the truth about who I am and what my nature is. The thought that I may have dedicated my life to a lie, that I might have accepted a conventional wisdom that no longer, if it ever did, corresponds to the external reality, that is a very painful realization. I will tend to resist it to the last. I will go to almost any lengths to prevent myself from seeing that the worldview that I have dedicated my life to is inadequate. I’m putting this in personal terms so that I don’t say “you,” so that I’m not accusing anyone of an attitude, but you understand that this is not a mea culpa; I’m trying to describe a psychological dynamic that I think exists, and it’s important and worrisome.""Instead of this, what we need is a honing of the skills of explication, of dialogue, of what used to be called logic and rhetoric and what used to be essential to every college education, a honing of the skills of compassion, which, just like intellectual abilities, need practice to be perfected. If we are to understand another’s belief, then we must also understand the deficiencies and inadequacies of our own. And those deficiencies and inadequacies are very major. This is true whichever political or ideological or ethnic or cultural tradition we come from. In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything? There is a worldwide closed-mindedness that imperils the species. It was always with us, but the risks weren’t as grave, because weapons of mass destruction were not then available.”"
