0,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27488361-ahmed-samir,2,"So for a while now I’ve been wanting to read a popular math book and Ian is a well known mathematician. I must say I was quite disappointed. The book has 17 chapters according to the 17 equations that are listed on the front. However, my only concern with this book is how poor the “popularization” was. Although the topics were very well written and extremely interesting, I still think he did a poor job in simplifying the math. As an engineer, most of the time, this was not an issue. But I can imagine that for a non-math/science major, this book would be quite problematic and quite unclear. Sometimes I had to repeat a chapter to understand fully what was going on. And that is usually not the case. Also, towards the end of the book, chapters started losing that element of excitement that kept you going through the first chapters. The ending chapters felt like I was pushing myself to finish just for the sake of finishing. Although I’ve gotten many ideas for my YouTube channel from the book, I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone but a core popular education reader. Other than that, it’s just a dense read. I would give it a 2."
1,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"There's been a trend for a couple of years in popular science to produce 'n greatest ideas' type books, the written equivalent of those interminable '50 best musicals' or '100 favourite comedy moments' or whatever shows that certain TV companies churn out. Now it has come to popular maths in the form of Ian Stewart's 17 Equations that Changed the World.Stewart is a prolific writer - according to the accompanying bumf he has authored more than 80 books, which is quite an oeuvre. That can't be bad. He is also a professional mathematician - a maths professor - and that potentially is a problem. The trouble is that, much more so than science, mathematicians are not ordinary people. They get excited about things that really don't get other people thrilled. And it takes an exceptional mathematician to be able to communicate that enthusiasm without boring the pants off you. It's notable that the most successful maths populariser ever, Martin Gardner, wasn't a mathematician.So how does Ian Stewart do here? Middling well, I'd say. The equations he provides us with are wonderful, fundamental ones that even someone with an interest in science alone, who only sees maths as a means to an end, can see are fascinating. In most cases he throws in quite a lot of back story, historical context to get us interested. So the meat of the book is excellent. But all too often there comes a point in trying to explain the actual equation where he either loses the reader because he is simplifying something to the extent that the explanation isn't an explanation, or because it's hard to get excited about it, unless you are a mathematician.The section on the Schrodinger equation, for example, is presented in such a way that it's almost impossible to understand what he's on about, throwing around terms like the Hamiltonian and eigenfunctions without ever giving enough information to follow the description of what is happening. (I also always get really irritated with knot theory, as the first thing mathematicians do is say 'Let's join the ends up.' No, that's not a knot any more, it's a twisted or tangled loop. A knot has to be in a piece of string (or rope, or whatever) with free ends.)Inevitably, to give the book real world interest, many of the equations are from science, and Stewart proves, if anything, better at getting across the science than he is the maths (probably because it is easier to grasp the point). The only section I'd argue a little with is the one on entropy, where he repeatedly says that entropy always increases or stays the same, where it's more accurate to say that statistically it is very, very likely to do so. But there is always a small chance that purely randomly, say a mixture of gas molecules will partly unmix. (He also uses an unnecessarily complex argument to put down the creationist argument that uses entropy to argue for divine intervention, as it's easiest to explain that you aren't dealing with a closed system, something he doesn't cover.)Overall, then, I am not sure who will benefit from this book. There's not enough detail to interest people studying maths or physics at university, but it becomes too obscure in a number of places for the general reader. A good attempt, but would have benefited from having a co-author who isn't a mathematician and who could say 'Sorry, Ian, I don't get that. Let's do it differently.' Bring back Simplicio.

2,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,5,"I am a fan of Ian Stewart. I think he is one of the best writers about Mathematics and Science in general -- certainly one of the most approachable to a layman, albeit a layman with a scientific/mathematical bent. I own and have read a number of his books, and have enjoyed them all. You can find a number of my reviews of his books on Goodreads.As the subtitle says, this book is about 17 equations that changed the world. As one who has a Ph.D. in Physics, I was familiar with all but one of these equations, but the author certainly broadens one's appreciation of the effects of these equations on the course of human history. The one I was unfamiliar with is the Black-Scholes Equation, about which more, later.Each chapter begins with a summary page, showing the equation in question, with little lines pointing to the major elements of the equations, and labels identifying them. Then, on the same page, the author lists three items: 1) What does it tell us? 2) Why is that important? 3) What did it lead to? This forms the basis for the rest of the chapter, and sets the tone. While the author talks a little about the mathematics behind the equation, he adds some history, some related anecdotes, and then a discussion of more details about why the equation is important, and how it has affected humans, sometimes over millenia. While I was familiar with almost all of the equations, I learned something new about each one, from the author's coverage. His writing style is light, and often amusing. He often refers to things in today's society that are relevant to the equation and its consequences.I was particularly delighted with Stewart's discussion, in the introduction to the chapter on the Second Law of Thermodynamics (a topic that I always found challenging, even as a trained physicist), of C. P. Snow's ""The Two Cultures""Two Cultures (http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/stu...), a lecture given in 1959 that has long rung true to my ears. Snow's premise was that, while society expects ""educated"" people to know, for example, the works of Shakespeare, and other literary and historical works, it is rare for those so-called educated people to know even basic science, least of all understand it. He used the Second Law of Thermodynamics as an example, as it is a very fundamental physical law that should be familiar to everyone. Snow bemoaned the low level of scientific education at the time, and it is my belief that the situation has only become worse -- so many people today ignore scientific results, often preferring political statements to those of science. The issue of climate change is the obvious example, but there are many more. Stewart's explanation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and its ramifications were extremely lucid, and his discussion right on target.The last chapter is entitled ""The Midas formula: Black-Scholes Equation"". This was the only equation I was unfamiliar with, and for a very good reason: it relates to Finance, and financial derivatives in particular. The author not only provides a very good explanation of the equation and how it has become the ""sine qua non"" of Wall Street and the big financial organizations, used to justify their reckless actions that caused the 2008-9 financial crisis and the resulting Great Recession, which is far from over as I write (despite all the glowing reports of economic growth). This chapter is a strong and authoritative indictment of what has happened in the Financial sector, and continues to happen, with no sign of any accountability ever being applied. If ""regular"" people read this chapter and fully understood it, they would (and should) become enraged over what has happened and continues to happen. Unless the financial sector is reined in, we are no doubt headed for more catastrophes in the future.One further point about this book: I have felt for some time that there is a real need for students (from middle school, high school, and college) not only to learn mathematics, but to learn how it is useful and relevant in their lives. Too often, mathematics is taught in a rote manner; too many students are turned off by repetitive problems (""Solve the following 40 quadratic equations"", and the like), and with too little understanding of the concepts and the true meaning of the many aspects of mathematics.I would love this book to become required reading at, say, the upper high school and/or college level, as I think it could help with this necessary deeper understanding of the relevance of mathematics. Unfortunately, I doubt that most students would have the necessary sophistication to fully understand many of the concepts in this book. This is not to say that the book is written at a very deep level, but it would take a relatively sophisticated reader to get the best out of the book. However, perhaps someone could teach a mathematics course with this as a supplementary text, with the necessary ""translation"" being performed by the teacher. I suppose I am forever optimistic..."
3,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Great book. Ian uses the equations as a launching pad to dive deeper into subjects that surround the equation. I greatly enjoyed his selection of equations. His last paragraph on each equation usually had some great personal commentary about society. I was a little disappointed in the discussion of Maxwell's Equations, as he tried to get a little technical, but then said a couple times that it would be too hard to explain correctly in this book. I'm a physics teacher, and I've seen very good, short explanations of Maxwell. But Ian finished the book on an equation that caught me off guard. The Midas Formula (Black-Scholes Equation) for investment modeling, was analyzed in how it led to the equation winning the Nobel Prize, to only then be greatly misused without full understanding, and thus leading to the banking debacle of the current century. Easy to just pick one of the 17 equations and read it. I read it cover to cover at the beach."
4,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27613955-ashley-reid,3,"There were parts of this book that made me want to rate this at least 4 stars, but there were also quite A few boring parts that made me want to skip over them completely. Overall it was A very interesting book and one that I will probably still recommend to some of the more dedicated math/science students in my GenEd classes."
5,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3,"Not every chapter in the British mathematician's latest book is actually about an equation, but most of them are. He covers Pythagora's theorem (the one about the sides of a triangle), logarithms, calculus, Newton's law of gravity, complex numbers, the relationship discovered by the Swiss mathematician Euler regarding the number of sides and vertices of polyhedra, the normal distribution (the bell curve), the equation used to describe waves, fluid mootion (Navier-Stokes equation) and electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations), the Second Law of Thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics, information theory, chaos theory,and the Black-Scholes equation used to price financial derivatives. Where an equation is involved, he shows and describes in words what each part of it does. I think it would be helpful, for some of the chapters, for readers to have had calculus, not because Stewart goes into the gory details of deriving equations, but rather so that they have a good idea of the usual interpretations of a derviative as a rate of change (for example, velocity is a measure of how ones location changes with time) and the integral as the sum of the area under a curve. Also, I think Stewart got confused about some of the financial terminology he discussed with regard to the Black-Scholes equation; I don't think the phrase ""mark to market"" means what he thinks it does (he seems to think it is a wholly owned subsidary of a bank used to keep risks off of the balance sheet of the bank; I think that would be a conduit). On the other hand, I think he was too kind to the use of the normal distribution in the Black-Scholes equation, which understates risk and which the creators could have known at the time that it did so. I especially enjoyed the chapters on information theory, on polyhedra, and oddly enough on logarithms. "
6,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671266-david,3,"While I enjoyed the description of many of the key equations covered, I did not find them well laid out. Either too great an understanding was assumed or too little. My major concern with the book arose in the final equation chapter where the author covers the black scholes equation and blames the financial crisis on the use of derivatives in a blanket manner. The arguments suggest a lack of understanding of fundamental economic theory particularly with regard to the need for derivatives in providing optimal allocations in an economy. He confuses securitised asset structures with futures and options. He even suggests at one point that hedge fund managers might somehow ""influence market conditions to make [mortgage] defaults more likely."" The populist banker bashing this chapter represented made me seriously question the accuracy of the detail in the other chapters. I am afraid one must approach this book with deep skepticism. "
7,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116131-stephen,2,"An interesting idea, but I found the book to be so badly written that it didn't really hold my attention. Some of the equations are really important, and we ought to have a working knowledge of them, but this isn't the vehicle to impart that knowledge."
8,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly,0,NO review. Just that I can't manage to bring myself back to this book again without putting myself to sleep. Maybe later.
9,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22027036-nick,4,"A neat idea this, to sum up the history of human attempts to explain the physical world in 17 equations. Ian Stewart takes us on a journey from Pythagoras to Einstein and beyond which I found at times fascinating, at times frustrating. GSCE Maths doesn't get you all that far when you are trying to comprehend calculus.Yet Stewart appears to be writing for the general reader. He references C.P. Snow's much-quoted complaint that educated people felt (perhaps still feel) quite comfortable not being able to explain the concepts of mass, or acceleration - the scientific equivalent of being able to read - and indeed have little more understanding of these concepts than their Neolithic ancestors.I think there is failure on both sides. I would very much like to understand science and maths better, which is one reason I read this book, but I appreciate that I haven't always given them the attention they deserve. And I should have concentrated harder in those Physics lessons. Yet the scientific community could try harder too. This book is a perfect example. Here is Ian Stewart very worthily setting out to explain 17 equations, some of them pretty complicated, to the general reader. And mostly, he does a good job. Yet in some chapters, I was reading and rereading paragraphs and still not getting it. I was struck by just how hard it is for experts - even excellent communicators like Stewart - to bring their explanations down to the level of their audience. I still enjoyed the book. Stewart adopts an interesting approach of explaining the circumstances around the discovery of each equation, zooming into the maths a little, zooming out to explain the wider relevance of the equation, and finishing by talking about its applications in the modern world. Some of these are quite unexpected. For example, I didn't realise Einstein's classic ""E=mc2"" was vital to the accuracy of GPS systems. I certainly hadn't appreciated the importance of Newton's development of calculus, which Stewart breezily points out led to ""most of mathematical physics"". (I had read a description of calculus in another book recently, and this time I think I almost got it.)While most of these equations seems to have an eternal quality of being ""always true"", Stewart also shows how they have limitations. Sometimes this is because they only work in certain circumstances. Pythagoras, for example, works very well on a two-dimensional plane - not so well on a curved surface. Newtonian physics is ideal for most practical applications (including planning space missions) but Einstein showed that if you work to a high enough degree of accuracy, it doesn't actually get you the right answers.Other chapters in the book include: logarithms (invented by a Scottish laird in the 17th century), imaginary numbers (the square root of minus one), normal distributions, Schrodinger's equation (and a good discussion of the famous cat), information theory (used to show how much data can be compressed and detect errors in data), and the Black-Scholes equation used for option pricing (which had a starring role in the 2008 financial crisis).Perhaps it is unfair to expect the author to give a general reader more than a glimpse of the significance of some of these very complex ideas. Stewart, on the whole, does a good job, even if 17 Equations is better suited to those with some basic grounding in mathematical and scientific theory than to readers whose existing knowledge is more, shall we say, Neolithic."
10,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18965658-luc-a-bol-var-s-nchez,5,"Awesome, so fun to read."
11,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21887977-bence,5,"Very easy to understand for the general audience. Interesting, relevant material; a healthy mix of history of science and cutting-edge research."
12,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50157466-vasiliskrin,3,"When I saw this book, its subject attracted my attention. However, I found it quite hard to read at times, despite having a statistical/mathematical background. I had to read some paragraphs twice in order to understand them; The author could have spared the reader the most technical details and focussed more on explaining these equations in layman's terms. "
13,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Most of the equations discussed are from Physics, and a lot of the time it's pretty obvious Stewart is writing outside of his field there—he's probably exactly the wrong person to be writing about the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation.Another is Shannon's information entropy equation (though Stewart labelled H ``information'', which is obviously wrong), and though information theory is technically a sub-field of mathematics, it's usually handled by computer scientists rather than pure mathematicians; Stewart's treatment is more confusing than it has to be.The final non-Mathematics equation is the Black-Scholes equation, which is hard to fuck up in that that equation is just smoke and mirrors to obscure the fact that the assholes running the financial sector don't outperform random number generators. That chapter just feels like it was only written so Stewart could vent his frustrations regarding the most recent real estate bubble, which, to be honest, is fair enough.For the most part, though, Stewart retreads very familiar ground, and the same criticism that has applied to almost every book he's written in the past two decades applies to 17 Equations: it's fine, I guess, but there's not really anything that sets it apart from any other popular maths writer, or indeed any other book Stewart himself has written."

If Ian Stewart had published this book pre-2003, maybe I wouldn't have skipped so many lectures after booze-induced somnolence.Ian does justice covering 17 of the greatest mathematical equations responsible for mankind's progress. He starts off with Pythagoras..a^2 + b^2 = c^2...for the folks that slept through math class in high school. He concludes the book with the Black-Scholes equation, a prime example of how dangerous equations can become if the underlying assumptions are ignored or in this case forgotten..""Long Term Capital Management"" anyone?Having majored in electrical engineering, I found the chapter covering information theory particularly refreshing....shannon's theorem never sounded so sexy...heheheI'd recommend this book to anybody about to embark on an engineering degree.Thank you Mike Nix!"

Thousand Plateaus
 and was reminded that I am unfluent in math. So at my willowy poetfriend's bookstore, I picked up this book, hoping to read about one equation a day. Which is what I did. And it's a damn fine introduction to these equations, but I've forgotten nearly everything. I can't sketch out the second law of thermodynamics, nor any of the other equations from memory, and couldn't give you but a rough outline of all of the engrossing history or science I learned from the book. This has more to do with me then the book. If I ever get enough money I'll hire a damn math tutor. But I'll have to find a tutor as good as this book, which won't be easy."

Like some other books by Ian Stewart, it does not attempt to explain all the maths to the uninitiated, nor does it describe the technicalities of how the equations have been used in e.g. modern technology: the more mathematically-minded reader may prefer to have a fuller exposition of the maths. What the book does, though, is give a feel for the relationship between the equations and their application in the real world. I found it readable, interesting, and occasionally provocative (especially in the final main chapter, which is centred on the recent financial crash), but would have preferred a deeper technical exposition."

25,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66701852-the-busy-reader,4,"https://www.thebusyreader.com/single-...When I was in high school, I benefited greatly from math teachers who were passionate about their craft (shout out to you, Mr. Lieblang and Mr. Garrett!). Their enthusiasm prompted me to continue to dabble in mathematics in college, where I advanced up to multivariable calculus. I remember learning to perform matrix multiplication in a large lecture hall, but also remember not seeing much utility in studying increasingly abstract concepts. I should have read Ian Stewart’s In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations that Changed the World. ""..the struggles of each chapter's mathematician takes on an urgency befitting an Oscar-worthy Hollywood movie."" The book reads like a fun history lesson, and Mr. Stewart brings to life the personalities behind such storied names like Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrodinger. He also introduced fascinating historical figures like Girolamo Cardano, the gambling scholar, and George Berkeley, the Bishop of Cloyne who intellectually sparred with Isaac Newton. With Mr. Stewart, there is historical context to math, and the struggles of each chapter’s mathematician takes on an urgency befitting an Oscar-worthy Hollywood movie. And in every page Mr. Stewart emphasizes that these equations, far from being a historical curiosity, have meaningful impact on our everyday modern lives, whether we love math or not.  ""The opportunities of our modern world are fundamentally indebted to these equations."" The book itself requires no formal math skills to enjoy. The early chapters acted as a refresher for concepts I hadn’t used in over a decade, whereas the mathematical concepts of the later chapters easily went over my head, even as I understood thematically what the equations have potential to achieve. Herein lies Mr. Stewart’s brilliance. Like my high school teachers, he takes an abstract topic and is able to breathe into it a vitality that reveals just how inspiring math can be. The opportunities of our modern world are fundamentally indebted to these equations. My appreciation for these opportunities are thanks to men like Mr. Lieblang, Mr. Garrett, and Mr. Stewart."
26,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,2,"The title of this book, 17 Equations that Changed the World, had appealed to me but, regrettably, I had to give up reading it after managing just seven of the seventeen chapters. In none of the chapters I struggled through did I fully understand the explanations being given by the author, Professor Ian Stewart, and it often seemed that he was shooting off at tangents, presenting material that was only indirectly related to the equation in question. Not only was I not learning much, but I was becoming very bored in the process. In a bizarre way, I found each chapter was too short to fully explain the derivation and significance of the equation, but too long to maintain my interest. I don't like giving up on books but I had to make an exception in this case.Also, some of the equations in the book aren't really equations to my way of thinking, but are more like mathematical tools, such as logarithms and calculus. Whilst these are extremely important, they have been squeezed into the book to fit with its overall theme.I had purchased this book at the same time as another work by Stewart (Professor Stewart's Incredible Numbers) and I had also struggled with that book, although I had managed to finish it. Nevertheless, in view of that first experience, I wasn't too surprised when 17 Equations that Changed the World failed to live up to my expectations. According to the blurb in the front, Stewart is the author of more than eighty books, which suggests he must have a devoted following, but personally I won't risk disappointment by buying any more.The best parts of the book for me were the one page introductions to each equation presented at the start of each chapter. Here, as well as laying out the equation, and labelling each part, Stewart also briefly answers three questions: ""What does it [the equation] say?"", ""Why is that important?"" and ""What did it lead to?"".My feeling is that this is a book that may appeal to readers with a strong background in maths or physics who are already well acquainted with most of the seventeen equations that are covered. Unfortunately, I think that others may find it difficult. In its favour, this is a book that hardened fans can dip into because each of the seventeen chapters is self-standing."
27,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63629672-henrik-warne,4,"Really interesting. I thought that it would mostly be about the mathematics of the formulas, but a lot is actually of the physics and applications of them. Not exactly what I expected but still really interesting. It is also partly a history book, in terms of how and when the equations were developed and applied.Some things that I especially liked: how Pythagora's theorem was used in surveying (it is easier to measure angels than distances), how much work multiplication of large numbers by hand is, and how logarithms help (I guess I knew this, but had forgotten), the importance and application of topology. In the Quantum Weirdness the author has a good argument against there being multiverses. The chapter on Information Theory is good - it is something I studied at university, and the description in the chapter is quite good.I am deducting half a star because of the last chapter (on Black-Scholes Equation). This is also something I have read a lot about before, and there are two things that bother me with it: the financial crisis of 2008 had several caused. One was to use the equation even though the simplifying assumptions were no longer true. However, other big causes were the incentives the banks had to make housing loans to people that couldn't afford them, and the expectation that the banks would get bailed out (these other two reasons are not covered). Also, it would have been nice with some intuition on why the Black-Scholes formula works. The best explanation I have read about that is in The Complete Guide to Capital Markets for Quantitative Professionals on pages 272 - 280.In summary, 4.5 stars - very interesting!"
28,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21232527-noi-nhieu,4,"It was informative, witty and fascinating. At times it can get as addictive as a video game. I wish textbooks could have been this fun so more students can enjoy learning and doing science. And they could spare some more space on the historical aspect of a discovery. Learning about how science progressed is just as important as learning about science. Especially in this era when the collective knowledge is way beyond the capacity of any single individual or even generation, it is important to remind our young, budding and to-be scientists that those great pyramids were built with minds that are just as human as theirs, one little brick at a time. The ""giants"" whose shoulders we stand on are in fact, numerous humans. And science progress is made in little steps, sometimes backward. It doesn't matter. We have grown up together.The atmosphere in science today may make us feel like science is either driven by fear or greed. But it's good to keep in mind that, at the core of it, what has kept generations of scientists obsessed with their equations and experiments is, in fact, an insatiable curiosity that human is born with.There is definitely room for improvement of this book and a little bit of proof-reading may have gone a long way. Sometimes I had to read a sentence 5 times, just to came to the conclusion that it is not grammatically sensible. Some other times there might have been a better explanation for a layman. But if you encounter them, just move on to the fun part. You don't have to understand every equation or sentence to enjoy it, just like quantum physicists didn't have to understand the quantum world in order to make good measurements and perform good calculations."
29,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30826704-eric-barnitt,2,"I've read other books by Ian Stewart. This is, in my opinion, the least successful of his popular science books.Unlike the other books of his that I've read (which, again, is only a handful of his published works), I am not sure who the target audience for this book is. For someone like me who has an education and background in mathematics, the book is neither technical nor deep enough to provide any new insight or understanding in the topics. I haven't studied Hamiltonian systems per se, but reading the chunks of the book where this topic was brought up didn't spark a deep understanding. I asked my fiance to read a chapter on calculus since I felt that was the most straightforward. Other than the parable-esque stories about Newton, she came away feeling confused about the mathematical concepts. Stewart mentions things like tangent lines, areas under curves, secant lines, instantaneous rates of change...All the buzzwords of calculus are there, but unless you know the material, you don't pick up on how those concepts apply to much of anything.In short: the target audience seems to be the incredibly specific and small niche of people who have taken some coursework in undergraduate mathematics, but maybe 20 years ago. This isn't successful as an introduction to the concepts for the uninformed, nor as a recap for the educated. Depending on your appetite and knowledge of these topics, I'd probably stay away. The book isn't poorly written, I just can't imagine someone reading it and concluding it was a good use of their time."
30,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706089-kim,3,"I read this on the recommendation of a math teacher friend, and I'd rate it higher if I knew more math. I estimate I understood about 80%. Even at that, I think everyone should read at least the first couple pages and last couple pages of every chapter. One of the chapters refers to the 2 different cultures of math/science people and humanities people. I feel like I caught a glimpse of how a mathematician might see the world--the power, complexity, and limits of patterns; the cumulative effect of knowledge; and cool little facts like where the equals sign came from and that it wasn't Samuel Morse but his assistant who invented Morse code! It was interesting to learn both the process of discovery for each of these 17 equations and also the effect they've had on our world--from GPS to jet planes to the stock market. (Also, in a serendipitous little conjunction of events, when I started reading a new sci-fi novel this week [The Flicker Men], I at least recognized words like ""decoherence"" and ""superposition."") "
31,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14502950-manish-mishra,4,"This book is genius, it has everything you could ask for. It begins with the very basic equations, discusses the history of mathematics around it and gradually makes the reader realize how the particular equation is embedded in the world he lives in. The book is compelling, humorous and most importantly, informative. It introduces the reader to the classical areas of mathematics and how they shaped the world early on and the later chapter (especially chapter 15-17) dive into the new mathematics and uncover the jargon that surrounds the research in this field today. The chapters on chaos theory and Black-Scholes equation were crazy but I also loved the chapters on the friendly Pythagoras theorem and complex numbers. There is something interesting in every chapter and that is exactly what makes this book an amazing read.Highly recommended."
32,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254159-andy-cyca,4,"[3.75 / 5] There's a great deal of discussion on whether this book is good or not. I believe this is because unlike other books promoting mathematics, this one *does* assume that you have some **working knowledge** on mathematics. However, I found it very illuminating regarding the history of maths, and how they are much more than just a series of meaningless, useless symbols.I found the last chapter to be very boring and skipped about half of it. The rest is a very good read on how math lives, how it's created and how (despite the opinions of many know-it-all schoolers) it is used in daily life."
33,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10279126-toshi,5,"Fascinating to know how those famous equations were invented. This book includes historical narratives to those 17 equations and explains how they are useful at the time of invention till today in different application areas. 17 equations are Pythagoras's Theorem, Logarithms, calculus, Newton's law of gravity, the square root of minus one, Euler's formula for polyhedra, normal distribution, wave equation, Fourier transform, Navier-Stokes equation, Maxwell's equations, second law of thermodynamics, relativity, Schrödinger's equation, information theory, chaos theory and Black-Scholes equation."
34,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67834548-holden-sanders,5,"Ian Stewart is one of my favorite authors within this genre. This is the second book that I’ve read by him. I have also read “The Mathematics of Life”. Dr. Stewart has a way of conveying information about math in a simple way that is easy to understand and does not come across as condescending. My favorite genre is science and math non-fiction. However, not all authors are as skilled at writing in such a way that makes it almost effortless for the reader to peruse its words. If you are at all inclined to read about math, I suggest that you start with a book by Ian Stewart. "
35,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/2982769.htmlA breezy popular science book, by an author well known in Pratchett fandom, looking at a succession of well known scientific equations and the concepts and consequences that have flowed from each one. He finishes with the Black-Scholes equation regarding the price of financial derivatives. A nice popularising book for the advanced reader."
36,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62747656-shreyansh-jain,4,"Its a good primer for people with interest in ""How stuff works"".Could be better, if long drawn explanations on Pythagoras and logs were shorter so that topics like toplogy, navier stokes, information and chaos theory, and black scholes could be made more elaborate.Also, the book needs more diagrams out of footnotes and into the main book .... far too many words are spent painting a picture that is apparent by a simple plot."
37,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20557364-michael,5,"Great introduction to higher math through the history of the main equations that have propelled thinking forward. Although some of the math is a little hard to understand without a background in calculus, the effects of the equations are understandable and profound. Worth reading to understand the full implications of modern scientific thinking. "
38,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37678132-shri-krishna-jayanthi,4,"Nice book. Initially I thought he would just describe randomly selected equations and give them a historic perspective. Actually, he selected and introduced equations in a logic timeline, where one equation follows other, helping and improving knowledge.Pequenas incorreções na tradução, sem comprometimento do entendimento."
39,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6594725-larry,5,"If Barbie had read this book, she wouldn't say, ""Math is hard!"" Stewart describes 17 important math discoveries together with the personalities who made them and the important world developments built upon these. Restating my Barbie sentence, if math were taught in schools not just abstractly as now but with the associations I mention, I believe this would increase math interest and fluency. "
40,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26011758-jonathan-leong,5,"A great book on influential equations. The author does a good job of explaining how the equation works, but also goes into good detail on the significance, the impact and historical context. A very interesting read. I could better understand the excitement of mathematicians if the subject was taught with this kind of context."
41,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94395424-mike-harris,5,"One of the most accessible books on the equations that make up the world of modern physics, mathematics, and computational theory. A must read for anyone with interest in understanding modern “science”. Well beyond the cursory overview given in a Ted Talk or YouTube channel, this book talks more about the why’s and the how’s."
42,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74947324-vu-ngoc-anh,5,"Nice book, easy explain. A hard problem form the world of science, like Math (Pythagore equation), Physics (Maxwell, Enistein Equation), even the Economy, is explained very good in book. Depend on book, I have new knowledge about space geometry - it exlain why we need study geometry with more dimension. Totally, it is a very good book. Thank Ian Stewart!"
43,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63086025-danielle,4,This is a great book. Stewart does his beast to present some very difficult subjects in simple fashion. It works as a really good summary of the way science and technology jump every now and then thanks to a theoretical breakthrough. 
44,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69004600-vincent-keenan,5,As a mathematician I am biased to say that I enjoyed this book. It gives a wonderful account of how mathematics pervades every singles person on Earth's life. It's a whirlwind tour of some of the greatest and most influential mathematical discoveries in history.

46,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9276610-meaghan,3,"I wish I had read something like this while in school. Also, this book made me miss school. I definitely think you need to have a general understanding of these equations to be able to really appreciate the book (the chapter on information theory and coding theory went a bit over my head)."
47,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20173643-jeannie,3,An interesting and readable book. I abandoned it prior to completion simply because I was already familiar with much of the content and my to-read list is so large!
48,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74513825-laura-aguilar,5,Ian Stewart is my favorite mathematic/scientific dissemination’s author. This book is amazing because he talks not only about equations but their history and the people behind them. 
49,0465029736,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11185950-bill,5,Terrific book about the 17 equations that help man better understand the world. The author took the time to explain the impact they had on society. Highly recommended!
