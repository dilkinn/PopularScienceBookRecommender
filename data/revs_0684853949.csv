I'm guessing I've brought it up hundreds of times in conversation.It's written by a neurologist who works with people who have stranger-than-usual brain issues. And not only are the cases interesting, but the way he writes about the people invovled is really lovely. It's not clinical at all. Not judgemental. It's very... loving, I would say. It's interesting to see someone who obviously knows a lot of hard-line science write about these cases in terms that seem to me more suited to someone who would be a philosopher or a spiritualist.Amazing book. Can't recommend it highly enough..."
1,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/604493-dru,3,"Dear Dr. Sacks, On page 112 of the paperback edition of your book, the second paragraph begins with the following sentence:""And with this, no feeling that he has lost feeling (for the feeling he has lost), no feeling that he has lost the depth, that unfathomable, mysterious, myriad-levelled depth which somehow defines identity or reality.""I've read this sentence at least twelve times, and I still don't even have the slightest inkling of what the hell it means. What is the subject? What is the verb? Why is the word ""that"" italicized (twice?)? Good God man, what are you trying to tell me?Sincerely,Baffled in BrooklynSome people may think ""well, if I read the whole chapter, I'm sure I could decipher the meaning."" To those people I say: good luck, Charlie. I hope you may succeed where I have so miserably failed. This book has many fascinating studies of neurological disorders, and the stories behind the patients are easily understood and, in many cases, enthralling. However, Dr. Sacks seems to give his readers too much credit when he throws off ""hyperagnosia"", ""Korsokovian"", and ""meningioma"" like he assumes we had read an entire neurology textbook before picking this one up. Also, many of his sentences (like the example above) include so many digressions and sudden turns that each one could practically be its own M. Night Shaymalan film pitch. All of this might have to do with the fact that it was written in the eighties, when I presume people were smarter."
2,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/173589-sheffy,2,"Despite so many people recommending this book, my high expectations were disappointed. Yes, it's perversely interesting to hear about neurological conundrums that afflict people in peculiar ways, but Sacks isn't a particularly good writer, nor does he have a good grasp on his audience. At times he obliquely refers to medical syndromes or footnotes other neurologists, as if he is writing for a technical physician audience, but on the whole his stories are too simplistic to engage such an audience. He talks about phenomenology, but doesn't satisfactorily discuss mechanistically what is going on in the brain, so what's the point? To quote a friend in college, it's his own ""mental masterbation""--he likes to show off how well-read he his, how many bizarre patients have been referred to him (or he's God's gift to them) and erudite his vocabulary is, but fails to clearly get his points across. On top of his confusing musings, his reconstructed dialogue is incredible unrealistic, it's clear why doctors need to learn to communicate better."
3,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508542-mark-lawrence,5,"This is an utterly fascinating book, a collection of case studies by neurologist Oliver Sacks, presented in an eminently readable style. These studies deal with the most extraordinary mental conditions, often arising from damage to the brain, from the title case where a man in full charge of his faculties is unable to identify the purpose of any object (thus his mistaking his wife for a hat) to individuals who, again otherwise wholly reasonable, will deny ownership of one of their limbs.This isn't presented as a freak show. Each person is shown as an individual demanding our respect and sympathy. The over-arching message is how little we understand ourselves and how both revealing and bizarre it is when the machinery of the mind breaks down.An enthralling, humbling read that will make you think in ways you have never thought before.

4,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21432277-supratim,4,"When I had come across the title of the book on Goodreads, I had mistakenly assumed to it to be a humour novel. But, when I finally found the book during one of my book hunts, I learnt that it is a non-fiction book where the author, a neurologist as well as a gifted writer, has presented some fascinating case studies about his patients with unique afflictions.The book has been divided into 4 parts wherein each section contains the case studies pertaining to a particular category of neurological afflictions.Medical case studies are written in a dry, clinical language where the patient is dehumanized, and reduced to a  cursory phrase . In the preface the author says,  “Such [medical case] histories are a form of natural history – but they tell us nothing about the individual and his history; they convey nothing of the person, and the experience of the person, as he faces, and struggles to survive, his disease.”  Thus, the author has attempted to  “deepen the case history to a narrative or tale”  and I liked the way he has talked about his patients with warmth, sympathy and respect.The narratives are often enriched with quotes, theories and experiences of other doctors, some of whom were stalwarts in their fields. There is a reference to Anton Chekhov as well.I believe most of us understand what a magnificent and complex entity the human brain is, and the book reinforced the fact that how fragile it can be – a little bit of damage and it can turn a person’s life upside down, make it difficult or even impossible for the individual to do even some basic functions which are so mundane that we do not even think about them. In the pages of the book, I came across afflictions I wouldn’t have imagined possible even in my weirdest dreams. A gifted music teacher suffering from “visual agnosia” had indeed mistaken his wife’s hand for a hat, and provided the title of the book; a woman would learn to use her hands at the age of 60 and prove herself to be a gifted sculptor; a man had the problem of leaning like the Tower of Pisa without his knowledge and would come up with his own novel solution and the list goes on. In some cases the patients would learn to cope, but in others they would not be so lucky. What a coincidence that I had just read Forrest Gump, the story of a fictional “idiot savant” before coming across real life idiot savants in the pages of this book.One particular comment by the author –  “The power of music, narrative and drama is of the greatest practical and theoretical importance” , pleasantly surprised me. I wouldn’t have expected this from a doctor, but maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised because the author did show his preference for a humane (for the lack of a better word) treatment of the patients.One problem you might encounter while reading the book is that the narrative is full of medical jargon. Thanks to the internet, we can find out the meanings much effortlessly compared to a dictionary, but if you read a real book, like I did and always do, then you need to put in the effort to type the words in your browser a lot of times. But, you know what, even if you do not check out every single jargon, you can till understand the fact of the matter.I understand that everybody might not like this book. But, if my review has piqued your interest, then I would urge you to at least check out the Goodreads page of the book.I just came across the list of : 100 books everyone should read by Amazon, and guess what! This book is included in the list."

Sacks chose the title of the book from the case study of one of his patients which he names ""Dr. P"" that has visual agnosia, a neurological condition that leaves him unable to recognize even familiar faces and objects. Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat became the basis of an opera of the same name by Michael Nyman, which premiered in 1986.عنوانها: م‍ردی‌ ک‍ه‌ ه‍م‍س‍رش‌ را ب‍ا ک‍لاه‍ش‌ اش‍ت‍ب‍اه‍ی‌ م‍ی‌گ‍رف‍ت‌؛ بانوی بی بدن؛ مردی که زنش را با کلاه اشتباه می‌گرفت و ماجراهای بالینی دیگر؛ نویسنده اول‍ی‍ور س‍اک‍س‌؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال 1999 میلادیعنوان: م‍ردی‌ ک‍ه‌ ه‍م‍س‍رش‌ را ب‍ا ک‍لاه‍ش‌ اش‍ت‍ب‍اه‍ی‌ م‍ی‌گ‍رف‍ت‌؛ نویسنده اول‍ی‍ور س‍اک‍س‌؛ مت‍رج‍م ج‍اه‍د ج‍ه‍ان‍ش‍اه‍ی‌؛ ب‍ا م‍ق‍دم‍ه: ح‍س‍ن‌ ع‍ش‍ای‍ری‌؛ تهران، صدای معاصر، 1377؛ در 356ص؛ شابک ایکس - 964649403؛ واژه نامه؛ موضوع لطیفه ها بیماریهای اعصاب از نویسندگان بریتانیایی - سده 20معنوان: بانوی بی بدن؛ نویسنده: اولیور ساکس؛ مترجم: سما قرایی؛ تهران، نشر قطره، 1390؛ در 366ص؛ شابک 9786001190070؛ چاپ دوم 1394، در 388ص؛ چاپ سوم 1395، در 350ص؛ چاپ چهارم 1397؛ در 348ص؛عنوان: مردی که زنش را با کلاه اشتباه می‌گرفت و ماجراهای بالینی دیگر؛ نویسنده: اولیور ساکس؛ مترجم ماندانا فرهادیان؛ تهران، فرهنگ نشر نو، چاپ دوم 1396؛ در 330ص؛ شابک 9786007439333؛ کتابنامه از ص 319، تا ص 328؛ مردی که زنش را با کلاه اشتباه می‌گرفت و ماجراهای بالینی دیگر، اثر عصب‌ شناسی به نام: «اولیور ساکس» است که در سال 1985میلادی منتشر شد؛ کتاب شرحی از ماجرای برخی از بیماران «ساکس» است؛ نگارنده عنوان کتاب را براساس یکی از بیمارانش، به نام «دکتر پی»؛ که مبتلا به «آگنوزیای دیداری»، یک بیماری عصبی، که تشخیص چهره‌ ها، و اشیای آشنا را، ناممکن می‌کند، برگزیده است؛ این کتاب بیست و چهار داستان دارد، و در چهار بخش: «از دست دادن‌ها، زیادی‌ها، جابجایی‌ها و دنیای ساده‌ ها» است، که هر یک به جنبه ی ویژه ای از عملکرد مغز مربوط استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 01/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
6,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez,0,"This is not only an informative work on neurological disorders, but a humbling meditation on the beauty of imperfection. Through entering the worlds of a number of ""limited"" individuals, Sacks reveals the brain's (and therefore the individual's) remarkable ability to overcompensate for cognitive deficiencies. As a result of these heightened states of perception, the often frightening and infinitely compelling worlds of each individual are manifested in the means with which they organize and engage with the ordinary, whether it be through mathematics, dance, music, or the visual arts. In simply dealing, they manage to transcend. Sacks explores the varying cognitive expressions of his patients without coming across as cold, sterile, or objectifying. Rather, he devotes a chapter to each individual case, creating in the reader a sense that they are engrossed in a series of fictional character studies, rather than a dry psychological manual or the surface-level observations and blind assumptions of a pompous intellectual. This would be a perfect starting point for anyone interested in learning a bit more about abnormal psychology."
7,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,2,"The man who mistook his patients for a literary career""The Man who Mistook His Wife for a hat"" is a non fiction book, which was published by the neurtologist Oliver Sacks in 1985, in which he describes the case histories of some of his patients.The case of Dr. PBy introducing the case of Dr. P, you will get a perfect feeling for what this book is about and how it is written.Dr. P, suffering from Visual AgnosiaDr. P. was a singer and a music teacher. During his time as a teacher he developed a strange condition, whereby he was unable to recognize his students’ faces, and instead recognized them purely by their voices. After consulting with a few doctors, Dr. P. came to see Oliver Sacks. Sacks quickly realized that Dr. P. was a man of great charm and sophistication. Yet when he spoke to Sacks, Dr. P. didn’t look at Sacks in an ordinary way, but seemed to “scan” different parts of his face, like his nose or his chin, wandering from one point to the next. When Sacks asked Dr. P. to take off his shoe for an examination, he mistakenly claimed that his shoe was his foot. Dr. P. also failed to identify basic pictures. He could describe the components of the picture, but not the overall scene. At the end of the examination, Dr. P. walked over to his wife, and tried to pick up her head—he’d mistaken his wife’s head for his own hat.Sacks realized that Dr. P developed of visual agnosia, which is the inability to interpret visual sensations. His sense of the concrete visual world slowly disappeared. Sacks told Dr.P that although he couldn’t entirely explain what’s wrong with him, he should continue teaching music, since that was what brought him joy. Although Sacks never saw Dr. P. again, he knows that Dr. P. taught music until the very end of his life.Disorders and their representationSacks introduces all of the disorders as summed up above and doesn’t expand on delivering a better understanding on how the brain actually works. Some of the stories are tremendously short, he describes only a few symptoms that the patient was experiencing and doesn‘t clarify why the patient was suffering in that way. Often he doesn’t even have a diagnosis and almost never was able to offer any kind of treatment. The explanations of the disorders are extremely shallow and he completely skips to show the suffering of the patient, often forgotten about in some care facilitiesThe part that upset me the most was about phantom pain and it‘s extremely inaccurate and superficial description. It is a disorder which is not psychological or imaginative but caused by injured nerves and receptors. A lot of patients suffer horrible pain and there are not many treatment options till today. Loosing a limb is a severe trauma to the body a few patients recover from well, but Sacks pictures it as some kind of funny phenomenon.In contrast a very accurate depiction of phantom pain Furthermore most of the conditions might have been not commonly known in 1985, but are today, like for example Tourette’s syndrome or autism. Another example is the case of an old woman suffering from syphilis, which made her feel sexual rejuvenated and active again, which she enjoyed and which is why she refused treatment. That exact case was picked up as a side story for the tv show „Dr. House“...You won‘t read much in this book, you have‘t heard before.The writing style  Oliver SacksSacks doesn‘t have a good grasp on his audience. At times he refers to medical syndromes or footnotes other neurologists, which requires some understanding of medicine, but on the whole his stories are extremely simplistic and superficial. Furthermore the dialogues with patients Sacks reconstructed are completely unrealistic. His target audience are clearly people who have no contact with medicine and neurological diseases and were rather ignorant about the topic before.The way he describes the encounters with his patients is quite self-absorbed, and I couldn’t help shake the feeling he was more interested in crafting the perfect dinner-table anecdote regarding a unique brain condition than he was in understanding the person it afflicted. He wants to introduce the weird in a humors way and completely fails to transport that he is talking about people‘s sufferings. “If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.”  - Great ""wisdom"" Mr. SacksOliver Sacks has turned his patients into objects of public curiosity, without offering a full picture of their condition. Most of the disorders are also common knowledge today. In any case a book that rather upset me, because it contributes to misconceptions of people with neurological disorders."
8,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"I've read a lot of popular science books in my time, and in one way or another they have always felt cut from same cloth. Similar language used, similar structure, drawing on the same inspirations. After a while it almost feels like you are reading the same book over and over again, with only slight variations in content.So The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat came as a complete breath of fresh air. A blast, in fact. Oliver Sacks has written a book rather unlike anything I've read before, both in its content and delivery, but also the way it acts as a meta-commentary on the field of science communication. The book is a collection of case studies from Sacks' career as a neurologist, each chapter focusing on a particular patient. The stories themselves are fascinating, ranging from the titular man who's vision is so neurologically impaired that he literally mistakes his wife for a hat, to the woman who lost all sense of proprioception - if she did not look at where her body was in space, she had no idea where it was. However the way that Sacks tells these stories was what gripped me. Quite apart from other popular science writers, he draws on a wide range of inspirations from poetry to philosophy to music to medical papers. The text is sumptuous. One gets the feeling of a writer who has lived a rich life, who has not been confined to one box of academia, and who allows his experiences to wash together in a melange of words on the page. I loved, loved, loved it.You could argue that Sacks actually makes a point about this in the final chapter, a neurological patient who is a brilliant artist but almost completely incapable of interpersonal communication. Reading this, at the very end of the book, I got the impression that Sacks was holding up the mirror to the way science was written about at the time, and still is to this day. Are you scientists not brilliant at abstract thought, gifted beyond measure in unpicking complex behaviour from a mass of data, yet totally incapable of connecting another human to that process? You spend so much time living in your box, in your world of abstraction, that you lack the necessary experience in being human, exposure to the humanities, to make a genuine connection to other people. Sacks demonstrates that if you allow the human to take centre stage, pushing the science to a supporting character, then communication, and wonder, will flow.Absolutely recommended. A real must-read."
9,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,5,"10★This is such a classic that I can’t possibly “review” it, so I’ll just share some stories. Oliver Sacks was the much-loved, highly regarded neurologist who opened up the world of the mind and brain not only to doctors but also to the public. The well-known movie, Awakenings, where he was played by Robin Williams, was based on his successful treatment of catatonic patients (including Leonard, played by Robert De Niro), “frozen” for decades after being afflicted with encephalitis. Sacks’s perception and inspiration led to the trial which “awakened” them, and he continued to use his remarkable insight and warmth until he died in August 2015.This book is a collection of cases of people with various brain anomalies, some caused by accidents or illness and some conditions present at birth. It is disconcerting today to read some of the accepted references to patients in 1985: retardates, defectives, idiots, morons, simpletons. “The Man” of the title piece, lost not only the ability to recognise faces, he didn’t even know what a face was. When he tried to put his shoe and sock back on after a medical test, he picked up his foot and asked if that was his shoe. His wife was seated next to him, and he reached across and pulled on her head when looking for his hat. He was almost like a blind man, guessing what and where things were by feel, smell, taste. Yet he still functioned as a music school teacher and sang or hummed his way through his daily life to keep himself on some sort of track.Other cases include phantom limbs (gone but still painful), limbs that are perceived as foreign (it’s somebody else’s leg in my bed, doctor, and when I try to throw it out, I end up on the floor), and a woman who had completely lost her proprioception – which is our sense of where our body is in space (a common failing of drunks, but not to this extent). We know how to pick up our foot and move it forward. She had to concentrate every second on where her body was and what she needed to do or she folded up and collapsed. Couldn’t sit or stand without actively thinking about it. Another woman’s case is worth sharing, it’s so unusual:
“She has totally lost the idea of ‘left’, with regard to both the world and her own body. Sometimes she complains that her portions are too small, but this is because she only eats from the right half of the plate—it does not occur to her that it has a left half as well. Sometimes, she will put on lipstick, and make up the right half of her face, leaving the left half completely neglected: it is almost impossible to treat these things, because her attention cannot be drawn to them (‘hemi-inattention’—see Battersby 1956) and she has no conception that they are wrong. She knows it intellectually, and can understand, and laugh; but it is impossible for her to know it directly.. . . Knowing it intellectually, knowing it inferentially, she has worked out strategies for dealing with her imperception. She cannot look left, directly, she cannot turn left, so what she does is to turn right—and right through a circle. Thus she requested, and was given, a rotating wheelchair. And now if she cannot find something which she knows should be there, she swivels to the right, through a circle, until it comes into view.. . . If her portions seem too small, she will swivel to the right, keeping her eyes to the right, until the previously missed half now comes into view; she will eat this, or rather half of this, and feel less hungry than before. But if she is still hungry, or if she thinks on the matter, and realizes that she may have perceived only half of the missing half, she will make a second rotation . . . ”
 and so on. Incredible, isn’t it?Tourette’s, Parkinson’s, Syphilis, Epilepsy, so very many conditions that cause brain malfunctions. The last part of the book deals with retardation and autism and how Sacks discovered that many people who were considered to be without any intelligence actually did have views of the world --it just couldn’t be measured. He says testing measures deficits. It doesn’t allow for the human, as opposed to the neurological, vision of a person. It reminds me of the saying: Don’t judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.Sacks says although our brain is computer-like, it is also personal and involves judging and feeling. Without that, our brains actually do become defective, and we can’t understand what is real and concrete, like “The Man”. He obviously can’t really interpret the world except the part he understands through music. And that still makes sense to him. But Sacks watched “hopeless cases” carefully, figured out what they reacted to when he spent time with them, and had the insight (and, dare I say, patience) to interact with them. They drew for him, played games, expressed themselves in their own way, and enjoyed his company. One simple, clumsy girl who couldn’t learn but who loved listening to her grandmother read stories, also loved being outside. He approached her in the park one day, and she gave him a huge smile, gestured, and then called out single words: 
“spring, birth, growing, stirring, coming to life, seasons, everything in its time.”
 Sacks realised she did have her own very clear, poetic, perception of the world after all.Regarding the people who seem to have unexplained abilities with numbers and calendars but who cannot perform on tests, he understands that they may see the world in numbers (as we see it perhaps in pictures or sounds). In 1966, he met a pair of severely impaired young twin men who always sat together giggling and calling out long numbers to teach other. They could also tell you any calendar date, but they didn’t seem able to “do” mathematics. Sacks started writing down their numbers, checked them, and discovered they were all, without exception, prime numbers (like 3 or 5, divisible only by 1 or by themselves, for those of you unfamiliar with primes.) But these were several digits long. So he got out his chart, sat with them one day, and then called out a prime number that was one digit longer than theirs. They were stunned! Sat and thought about it, smiled, and started calling out numbers the same length (7 and 8 digits). They eventually outstripped him (12 digits!), but Sacks had no way of checking anything more than 10. They ended up with 20 digits, which he had to assume were also prime. He quotes the mathematician Wim Klein, speaking about himself:
 “‘Numbers are friends for me, more or less. It doesn’t mean the same for you, does it—3,844? For you it’s just a three and an eight and a four and a four. But I say, ‘Hi! 62 squared.’”
I don’t know how much has changed in the thinking since this book was written, but I quite like his idea that we all respond to order and patterns, and while most of us respond in similar ways to similar things, some people need to have music to order their activities (“The Man” could function as long as he sang or hummed), some need numbers, some need nature. Given the right conditions, many people who were previously cast aside could enjoy life more on their own terms. He does caution about what we would now call “mainstreaming” people (to make them more like “us”). The number twins were separated to give them a better chance to live a normal life, which they did to some extent (catching public transport, etc.), but the joy seemed to disappear. What kind of price is that to pay to meet our standards instead of their own?“One is reminded somewhat of the treatment meted out to Nadia— an autistic child with a phenomenal gift for drawing . . . Nadia too was subjected to a therapeutic regime ‘to find ways in which her potentialities in other directions could be maximized’. The net effect was that she started talking—and stopped drawing. Nigel Dennis comments: ‘We are left with a genius who has had her genius removed, leaving nothing behind but a general defectiveness.’ ”It's a fascinating glimpse into a fascinating field of study. It’s scary to think how many people we’ve passed judgement on over the years who could have been freer to enjoy life if we’d figured out how to enable them.I’m looking forward to reading some of his newer work to see where it took him and whether or not we’re doing a better job of understanding the immense variation of the human condition today.P.S. Another GR reviewer, Barbara, has done a nice job of summarising some of the cases in her review. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
10,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/205784-tim,2,"I picked up this book because I am a fan of Oliver Sacks and his various speaking engagements (lectures, public radio interviews, etc)...but I have to say I was fairly nonplussed with it.While the case studies in and of themselves make for interesting reading, the tone of the writing is fairly ""clinical"" and...removed. Despite the review blurbs stating that these are ""personal"" and ""touchingly human"" looks at neurological disorders, I saw only a few glimpses of this warmth (an example that springs to mind is the ""Returning To India"" story).I can't really pin down what I didn't like about the book, but reading it, I had the sense I was being whisked in and out of hospital rooms by a busy, clipboard-toting doctor...which wasn't the best feeling."
11,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,3,"Dr. Oliver Sacks was a physician, author, and neurology professor who published several books about people with neurological problems. In this book Dr. Sacks discusses patients whose brain malfunctions cause a variety of 'maladies' including: a musician who lost the ability to see faces or recognize familiar objects; a former sailor who believed the year was permanently 1945; a man who thought his leg belonged to someone else; and other unusual afflictions. To provide a feel for the book I'll just give a capsule description of the most interesting cases.THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HATDr. P was a talented musician and music teacher whose problems began when he lost the ability to see people's faces - though he could recognize them by their voices and movements. The problem worsened to the point where Dr. P mistakenly thought inanimate objects - like fire hydrants, parking meters, and furniture knobs - were humans. In time Dr. P could no longer identify everybody objects. For example, he thought his shoe was his foot and vice versa. Though Dr. P was not diagnosed, physicians speculate that he had a brain tumor or brain damage that caused 'agnosia' - ""the loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells.""The title of the story refers to the fact that - when looking for his hat one day - Dr. P mistook his wife for a hatrack, took hold of her head and tried to put it on. Luckily, Dr. P retained the ability to play and teach music, and was able to continue with his fulfilling career.🔷THE LOST MARINERIn 1975, Dr. Sacks saw Jimmie G - a 49-year-old man who left the Navy in 1965 after serving for more than two decades. Jimmie seemed confused about his current situation but was able to describe his school days and his experiences during and after WWII - which he talked about in the present tense.Dr. Sacks learned that - in Jimmie's mind - the year was perpetually 1945 and he was 19-years-old. Jimmie couldn't recall anything that post-dated 1945 and was unable to form ANY new memories. In fact, if Dr. Sacks walked out of the room and returned, Jimmie thought they were meeting for the first time.When shown a mirror, Jimmie was shocked at his 'old' appearance, and - though his brother was long-married with grandchildren - thought his sibling was a single man in accounting school.Apparently Jimmie was competent until he left the Navy, but by 1971 was totally disoriented - probably from alcohol abuse. It was determined that Jimmie suffered from amnesia due to 'Korsakov's Syndrome' - ""an amnestic disorder usually associated with prolonged ingestion of alcohol.""🔷THE DISEMBODIED LADYChristina was a bright, athletic 27-year-old computer programmer who worked from home. When health problems required the removal of her gall bladder, Christina was treated with prophylactic antibiotics prior to the operation. This was a common precaution, not expected to have any deleterious effects.Shortly before the surgery Christina had a dream in which she lost sensation in her hands and feet. A couple of days later Christina REALLY lost sensation in her entire body. Christina couldn't feel her arms, hands, legs, feet, etc. She couldn't walk, was unable to pick things up, and so on. Christina felt like her body was 'dead, not real, not hers.'Christina was diagnosed with inflammation of the nerves in her limbs. As a result, Christina lost her sense of 'proprioception' - ""the ability to sense the relative positions of body parts without looking at them or thinking about it."" It's unknown whether the prophylactic antibiotics caused this or not.Eventually, Christina learned to use her other senses - especially vision - to compensate for her loss of propioception. Christina had to consciously monitor and regulate every motion, making her movements difficult and clumsy. Nevertheless, Christina persevered and tried to live as normal a life as possible.🔷THE MAN WHO FELL OUT OF BEDDr. Sacks was called in to see a man who had been admitted to the hospital because of a problem with his leg. After falling asleep in the hospital, the patient woke up to find 'someone's leg in the bed', a severed human limb. The man was horrified, and concluded that a nurse had perpetrated a bizarre joke. The patient threw the leg out of bed, but he went with it, because the limb was attached to him.While Dr. Sacks was in the room, the patient began punching and tearing at his left leg. Dr. Sacks advised the man to stop, as he was injuring his own limb, but the patient refused to accept this.The man apparently had hemiplegia - ""paralysis on one side of the body"", probably caused by brain damage.🔷PHANTOMA 'phantom' is the sensation that a lost body part (usually an amputated limb) is still there.Dr. Sacks tells the story of a sailor who accidently cut off his right index finger, but couldn't dislodge the notion that the digit was still sticking out of his hand. For the next 40 years, the sailor was wary of bringing his damaged hand near his face - to eat or scratch his nose - because the finger might poke his eye out. The sailor knew this couldn't really happen, but was unable to make the feeling go away.The sailor was finally 'cured' when he lost sensation in ALL of his fingers due to diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). The phantom finger 'disappeared' with the rest of his digits.🔷TILTMr. Dunston, a 93-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, tilted to the side when walking - to the point he was in danger of falling over. However Mr. Dunston was unaware of the slant, and refused to believe he wasn't upright until Dr. Sacks filmed him in motion.Mr. Dunston, who had been a carpenter, attributed the problem to the loss of his inner 'spirit level' (an instrument used to determine whether a surface is perfectly horizontal or vertical).Mr. Dunston, being a clever fellow, rigged up a 'level' that could be attached to his eyeglasses - called 'spirit spectacles' - which he could use to correct his posture. The spirit spectacles became very popular with patients afflicted with Parkinson's disease.🔷EYES RIGHTAfter a massive stroke, Mrs. S - a woman in her sixties - lost the ability to see anything on the left side. If Mrs. S's dessert was on the left side of her tray, she couldn't see it; in fact Mrs. S couldn't even see the food on the left side of her plate. This 'left blindness' extended to everything, so that Mrs. S. would only make up the right side of her face, etc.To compensate, Mrs. S got a rotating wheelchair and swiveled in a circle until things came into view - a crafty solution to (some of) her problems.🔷CUPID'S DISEASENatasha, a 90-year-old woman, had begun feeling unusually 'frisky' at the age of 88 - giggling, telling jokes, and flirting with men.Natasha realized this was 'inappropriate', and - surmising she was physically ill - consulted a doctor. Natasha reported that, at age twenty, she had contracted 'Cupid's Disease' (syphilis) - which was treated, but apparently not eradicated.In fact Natasha WAS suffering from neurosyphilis - an infection of the brain and/or spinal cord caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. The bacteria were stimulating her cerebral cortex and affecting her behavior.Natasha didn't want to get end-stage syphilis, but didn't want to be cured either since she was enjoying her girlish feelings. So doctors gave Natasha penicillin to kill the microbes, but did nothing to repair her cerebral cortex - allowing the elderly woman to remain playful. (At 90 years old, why not. LOL)🔷REMINISCENCE Mrs. O'C - an 88-year-old Irishwoman living in an old age home in NY - was a little deaf but otherwise in good health. One night Mrs. O'C dreamed of her childhood in Ireland, complete with a woman singing Irish songs. When Mrs. O'C awoke, she still heard the Irish songs - very loud - and went to turn off the radio broadcasting the music. But there was no radio. Mrs. O'C then thought her dental fillings were picking up a broadcast, but this wasn't the case either. Finally, Mrs. O'C concluded something was wrong with her ears - and consulted a doctor.Mrs. O'C was eventually sent to a neurologist - Dr. Sacks - but had trouble hearing him through the music. Dr. Sacks determined that the songs were neurological, probably due to a stroke that caused seizures in Mrs. O'C's temporal lobe (a part of the brain that processes music). As Mrs. O'C recovered, the music faded away.🔷THE DOG BENEATH THE SKINStephen D. was a 22-year-old medical student who regularly used amphetamines, cocaine, and PCP. One night Stephen dreamed he was a dog, and woke up with a greatly heightened sense of smell.Stephen was able to distinguish all kinds of things by their 'aroma' including: friends, patients, streets, stores, sexual activity, foods, and so on. Unfortunately, unpleasant odors were stronger as well. Moreover, Stephen felt COMPELLED to sniff everything (like a pooch)....and had to be careful to avoid being inappropriate.After three weeks the enhanced sense of smell disappeared, and Stephen returned to normal. Years later, Dr. Sacks revealed that HE was Stephen D. (Naughty naughty)🔷THE WORLD OF THE SIMPLE**I have to insert a note here. To modern ears, some of the language used in this section is very disturbing. Talking about people who are mentally challenged, Dr. Sacks uses terms like: simple, simpleton, retardate, mental cripple, idiot, moron, and dullard. Granted, these essays were written before such terms became 'forbidden.' Still, the book has been re-released several times over the years, and these words could have been changed (IMO).**JOHN AND MICHAELJohn and Michael were 26-year-old twins who had been institutionalized since the age of seven. They had an IQ under 60, and were variously diagnosed as autistic, psychotic, or severely retarded.As happens with some autistic people, the twins were 'idiot savants' - ""mentally handicapped persons who display brilliance in a specific area, especially involving memory.""The twins had clear memories of ALL their experiences and had a 'calender program' in their heads so that - given any date, past or future - they could instantly pair it with a day of the week. The twins were also able to recall and repeat a long string of numbers (over 300 digits), explaining that they 'could see it.'Perhaps most remarkable of all, the twins made up a game in which they recited increasingly large prime numbers to each other, a feat that's almost impossible without a computer. In fact, Dr. Sacks - wanting to join the game - got a 'cheat book' of prime numbers. (Ha ha ha)Dr. Sacks waxes poetic about the twins, saying: ""The twins, though morons, hear the world's symphony, but hear it entirely in the form of numbers.""Eventually the twins were separated - 'for their own good' - which seems very sad to me.THE AUTIST ARTISTJosé was a mentally handicapped man whose epileptic seizures and (possible) autism became obvious when he was eight. At that time José's family confined him to the cellar, where he was isolated and deprived of stimulation for 15 years. Finally, at the age of 22, José 'blew up in a rage' and was hospitalized.In the hospital, José - now properly medicated - showed a remarkable talent for drawing. This was when Dr. Sacks met the patient. Dr. Sacks showed José his pocket watch and asked him to draw it. José studied the timepiece, then quickly and confidently drew a faithful facsimile, with creative flourishes. Dr. Sacks was impressed, thinking José had more mental agility than people thought.During a later visit, Dr. Sacks showed José an issue of 'Arizona Highways' magazine, which had a scene of people canoeing. José swiftly copied the canoe and canoers - making the people seem even more intense and alive than the original. To Dr. Sacks, this demonstrated José's powers of imagination and creativity.Then, when Dr. Sacks showed José an image of a rainbow trout, the patient drew a fish of his own - with an amusing roguish look, like a 'fish-person.' This showed not only imagination, but a sense of humor.Eventually, surrounded by caring doctors and staff, José began to blossom. He no longer accepted his deprived state, strived to recover speech and understanding, and began to draw for self-expression.🔷Dr. Sacks' case studies are interesting and informative, and - when originally published - shed light on afflictions that were not well understood at the time. Dr. Sacks' stories are still fascinating and I enjoyed reading them.I also applaud the fact that Dr. Sacks showed that mentally challenged individuals can have talents and abilities that rival those of mainstream society - which usually marginalizes these people. And I admire Dr. Sacks attempts to help his patients find happiness and meaning in their lives.That said, Dr. Sacks includes a LOT of philosophical musing in his stories, in an attempt to imbue neurological afflictions with some deeper meaning. In my opinion, illnesses (even brain malfunctions) are biological phenomena. Thus they have no abstract significance, and I found the 'philosophical' sections of the book boring and sometimes incomprehensible.I'd recommend the book to readers interested in neurology.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
12,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60939-mona,5,"I first heard about this book when my biology professor mentioned it in class in reference to right-brain and left-brain disorders. Just last year, I had the good fortune to see the author himself - Dr. Sacks - speak at the university in my hometown. He was a dynamic and entertaining speaker and from then on, I resolved to try out his books. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat matched its author. The book is a collection of case studies on Dr. Sacks's patients with neurological disorders. Sacks divides the book into four parts, each of which deals with ""losses"" and ""excesses of neurological functions, ""transports"" of hallucinations, visions, and imagination, and ""the simple"", concerning the mentally or physically challenged, respectively. In one chapter titled ""The Twins"", Sacks describes a pair of twins who had the ability to factor large numbers in their heads, so much so that they could calculate the date of any day of the week in history. He discovers that numbers, especially prime numbers were, for them, a special sort of communication that required no thinking through but was instantaneous. In another chapter, Sacks relates how a previously healthy patient woke up one morning convinced that the leg lying in his bed was not his. Efforts to convince him otherwise (including his own efforts to toss it out onto the floor which resulted in the rest of him falling out as well) were fruitless. How and why do these pheomena occur? These are the questions Sacks attempts to answer. Although Sacks includes discussion of concepts that may be familiar only to psychologists or neurologists, the book is accessible to readers without that type of backgroud. It was extremely readable, such that I finished it in two days. My only complaint is that although Sacks includes a postscript to most of the chapters to explain further studies or new discoveries that occurred after he first met these patients, there is often no resolution to these stories. This is understandable, considering that many of the patients' disorders are unusual and may not have any resolution, but I still found it a little frustrating. I do, however, want to do more reading on this subject and look foward to reading Sacks' book titled Awakening. "
13,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,2,"The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a book about people with neurological disorders centred on issues with perception and understanding the world. The brain receives so much information each second, information we will never be consciously aware of. But what happens when the pathways start to break down? Weird and wonderful things evidently. Sacks reminisces over some truly bizarre case studies he encountered over his career. And, like the title suggests, one involves a man who mistook his wife for a hat in his inability to accurately perceive people and his utter confusion regarding objects. It’s amazing really how someone like that can get through life. The way they see the world, the way they experience the realities of the everyday, will be vastly different to what you and I see. For them though it is normal. They don’t know that their mode of reality completely alien to everybody else’s. When this was published Sacks addressed some rather odd disorders but now, over thirty years later, this book is less shocking as many of these conditions have been normalised to an extent. The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a mere curiosity, nothing more."
14,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription “If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.” 🌟 I have been intrigued by this book’s title as soon as I first heard it. I thought it was a fiction book but then discovered that it is Non-fiction and I decided to read it this year as part of my challenge to read some non-fiction books.🌟 Then, I discovered that it was written by a neurologist and it features neurological disorders. I had a hate relationship with Neurology and its disorder in the first two years in medicine. I then decided that I had enough and that I want to understand it more. I went back to the basics, took Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience courses, aced them and I became yet another fan of neurology!!!🌟 The human brain is one of the most intriguing things ever and is also one of the biggest mysteries of the universe, and although our understanding of it is way better than decades ago, we still haven’t scratched the surface –at least for me-.🌟 The disorders this book includes are interesting as the man who mistook his wife for a hat literally, Phantom limbs in which people can feel pain and sensations in their amputated limbs, Seizures that made a man has super smelling, the twins who can’t do simple arithmetic but can tell you how many sticks are stacked together just by a simple glance and more!! Some of the cases were not very interesting but they were mostly short cases so it was OK!🌟 I can’t say Dr.Oliver is the greatest author because his writing is full of medical jargon and may be hard to understand for non-medical readers. He assumes that we have a good knowledge in many things as opposed to the book I am currently reading (Which discusses sleep and the language makes much more sense for all readers). Dr.Oliver’s language is like a text-book/ scientific language more befitting for teaching than a general book.🌟 Summary and Prescription: I have a long history with Neurology so this was a mini challenge for me to read. The language is not very easy (But still can be understood) for the general population. There are some really interesting cases here for anyone who is interested in the human brain and it’s disorders.I decided to give this one a 3.5 out of 5 stars!"
15,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,2,"I guess I'm just not smart enough to fully appreciate this book. But I do realize that an awful lot can go wrong with our brains, and when that should happen to me, I would be very lucky with such an empathetic and humane doctor. Yet, his writing is dry and clinical, which is a shame because there were really interesting cases. I enjoyed reading some parts of the book, but not enough to feel satisfied about reading this book. Especially the chapter ""The Visions of Hildegard"", in which he describes the hallucinatory visions of migrainous origin from a 12th century nun Hildegard from Bingen, made me wonder why this book is so popular. "
16,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,2,"This was an interesting delve into neurological patients and their lives that Oliver Sacks has encountered in his field of work. To appreciate this, I do think one needs to first have an appreciation for neurology, which I do, and for the most part, I think it is truly fascinating.This book was set into chapters, and those chapters contained the stories about his most interesting patients, or, ones that challenged him the most. I found certain patients cases to be more readable than others, as admittedly, some of the medical jargon lost me at times. This book doesn't expand on delivering a better understanding on how the brain actually works, which personally, is what I was expecting. Some of the stories are tremendously short, and therefore quite a pointless addition to the book. I mean, there was a description of the symptoms that the patient was suffering from, but no clarification as to why the patient was suffering in that way. Where was the diagnosis? Overall, I found parts of this book to be interesting, but, the authors writing style made it feel pretty unfulfilling. "
17,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,5,"To me sinful chocolatey wisdom is conveyed best in stories and “The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat” presents twenty-four such anecdotes (neurological histories) by Dr. Sacks (author of Awakenings and A Leg to Stand On). Within, words becoming “émettant de la lumière” serving as shining diagnostic gems for people in his care. London born Sacks is soft-spoken and spellbinding in his telling of stories---including his terminal one. When Dr. Oliver Sacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer he said, “The most we can do is to write — intelligently, creatively, critically, evocatively — about what it is like living in the world at this time.” —Oliver Sacks, MD “The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat” is equivalent to a visceral motorbike ride in leather via the Malibu Canyon with treacherous hairpin turns into loss, heartache and hope---for patients afflicted with Parkinson's, Tourette's and Korsakov's syndrome. This ride imparts a sensory journey into a moldy neurological dungeon with Sacks narrating and illuminating the strengths in each deficit ridden patient---think IQ’s in the range of 60. The patient who served as the inspiration for this book was afflicted with apperceptive agnosia---a rare disease characterized by individuals who cannot properly process what they see. Though Dr. Oliver Sacks is no longer with us, the evidence of his life, craft and the way he affected the world lives on (in his books, partner Bill Hayes and his foundation). Definite must read for neurology students! Brilliant! Buy."

"" Is there any 'place' in the world for a man who is like an island, who cannot be accultured, made part of the main? Can 'the main' accommodate, make room for, the singular? ""
That was the main inquiry of this insightful, compassionate, moving and Remarkable book.. the lucidity and power of a gifted writer.A wonderful book … full of wonder, wonders and wondering. Sacks brings to these often unhappy people understanding, sympathy, and respect. Sacks is always learning from patients, marveling at them, widening his own understanding and ours.Dr. Sacks treats each of his subjects with a deep respect for the unique individual living beneath the disorder. These tales inspire awe and empathy, allowing the reader to enter the uncanny worlds of those with autism, Alzheimer’s, Tourette’s syndrome, and other unfathomable neurological conditions.He shares his experiences with readers to dispel prejudice against people who are different because of their problems. One very important truth that Sacks tries to incorporate into his life and work is that one can respect others no matter what their limitations may be.
"" animals get diseases, but only man falls radically into sickness ""
 and this book is about weird conditions and the human reaction towards them, about the attempts at restitution and reconstruction of a world of complete chaos. This book is about this 'organized chaos'.These case histories are about the individual and his history, about the person and the experiences he faces, and struggles, to survive his disease.In the first case,Mr.P. and prosopagnosia, the man who mistook his wife for a hat, we see how he picks-up tiny features, but not the scene-as-a-whole, failing to see the whole and trapped in the details, and lost in a world of lifeless abstractions.Luis Bunuel said : 
"" You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realize that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life at all.""
 and that what happened to the 'Lost Mariner', 
"" what sort of a life (if any), what sort of a world, what sort of a self, can be preserved in a man who has lost the greater part of his memory and, with this, his past, and his moorings in time? ""
 , he was stuck in a constantly changing, meaningless moment, imprisoned in his past. He haven't felt 'alive' for a very long time. His time suddenly stopped, and he lost his soul.But the fact is 
"" A man does not consist of memory alone. He has feeling, will, sensibility, and moral being .. Memory, mental activity, mind alone, could not hold him; but moral attention and action could hold him completely ""
Proprioception is the way by which the body sees itself, and her body went blind, she was disembodied. 
"" What life it is if you painfully forced to use your consciousness with every simple movement you attempt to do? ""
 she replaced her natural posture and self-image with a second conscious nature, she even will grip the fork and knife with painful force.Christina is condemned to live in an indescribable, unimaginable realm. She says about the 'old Christina' : 
"" I can't identify with that graceful girl any more! She's gone, I can't remember her, I can't even imagine her. It's like something's being scooped right out of me, right at the center.""
Nietzsche writes : "" One can lie with the mouth, but with the accompanying grimace, one nevertheless tells the truth "", and that exactly what the aphasics grasp in their 'second nature', after loosing any meaning to any word.You read about a 'handless' woman , who turns into a sculpting artist, and a woman who completely lost her left half. You read about 
"" the paradox of an illness which can present as wellness - as a wonderful feeling of health and well-being, and only later reveals its malignant potentials.""
 In the second part of the book, the excess, we read about the feverish energy and the morbid brilliance, about the deceptive euphoria with abysses beneath, about patients who are faced with disease as seduction, 
"" for 'wellness', naturally, is no cause for complaint- people relish it, they enjoy it, they are at the furthest pole from complaint. People complain of feeling ill- not well. Unless, as George Eliot does, they have some intimation of 'wrongness', or danger, either through knowledge or association, or the very excess of excess.""
Nietzsche says : "" Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit "" , and that what happened with the wild disease of Tourette, and that is how a person is 'reanimated' , as in Cupid's disease. Even the patient says about it : "" I know it's an illness, but it's made me feel well. I've enjoyed it, I still enjoy it.""
"" We are in strange waters here, where all the usual considerations may be reversed- where illness may be wellness, and normality illness, where excitement may be either bondage or release, and where reality may lie in ebriety, not sobriety.""
The world keeps disappearing, losing meaning, vanishing - and they must seek meaning, make meaning, in a desperate way, continually inventing, throwing bridges of meaning over abysses of meaningless, the chaos that yawns continually beneath them.You read about people drowning in an ocean of sounds, about 'mental diplopia', about the possessed, this woman who, becoming everybody, lost her own self, became nobody. About the woman who took a back-home journey, and died after she 'arrived'.And in the last part about the world of the simple, he tells us about people who are though mentally defective in some ways, they may be mentally interesting, even mentally complete, in others. 
"" We find ourselves entering a realm of fascination and paradox, all of which centers on the ambiguity of the 'concrete'.""
 
"" In medicine, understanding and collaborating are central, patients and physicians are coequals, on the same level, each learning from and helping the other , and between them arrive new insights and treatments.""

19,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"Review to come. This was a hard one to rate. Lots of 5 star sections but some needless academic jargon, particularly in the introductions to sections. I can see why this is considered a classic. Such fascinating case histories. The brain is truly a mysterious thing. "
20,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335127-laala-kashef-alghata,5,"This book isn't easy to review, because it's not a novel, or short story collection; it's not poetry, or essays. It's straight up non-fiction in the form of case studies and clinical analysis of different bizarre neurological cases that Oliver Sacks came across. There's everything from the titular character -- a man who really did mistake his wife for his hat -- to people with Tourette's, both severe and manageable; from excesses to people with IQs of 60 but who possess amazing talents.There is a wide variety of cases presented. My interest in psychology, which will hopefully be my future career, is what led me to pick up this book. There's only so many academic articles you can read without wanting to smack your head against concrete, so I thought this would be a welcome change, both enlightening and easier to absorb. Sacks has a truly wonderful ability to make his writing accessible, while not for a moment relinquishing the jargon he needs to use or 'dumbing down' the studies for general consumption. It's quite enviable. I gained a lot of perspective from reading this, I tried to use what I have already learnt to understand his explanations more, and I really, really enjoyed reading it. It's an amazing book that showing the extraordinary capabilities of the human mind and psyche and the extent to which, despite all of our advancements in science, we know very little about one of our body's most important organs. "
21,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65252746-deedee,5,"I read this book years ago and maybe Sacks was a more skilled doctor than writer but a lot will depend on why you're reading this book to begin with. I felt, still do, that Dr. Sacks humanised his patients and that's not necessarily easy given the subject. The brain has such layers of complexity that are not fully understood. Sacks attempts to issue clarity on the matter, no pun meant, it could happen to you or a loved one~ trauma, a stroke, lasting or transient confusion. To have someone in your corner looking for a solution was comforting. Excellent clinical reading in a non-clinical and compassionate format. "

23,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028489-collin,1,"Dry. Reading this book is like eating saltine crackers without anything to drink. He only briefly discusses the cases (these are, ahem, the interesting parts of the book) and then embarks on tedious philosophical discussions about neurology. He does seem very proud of himself and his education, though; I will give him that as a backhanded compliment."
24,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,4,"Over the course of his long career as a neurologist, Sacks has had plenty of interesting cases. It makes you appreciate what a complex organ the brain is when you see all the different ways that impairments can manifest themselves. Sacks is at his best when he's describing the most unusual quirks. The first chapter -- the case that gives the book its title -- is a good lead-in to the weird behaviors that follow.At the time the book was written, these disorders must have seemed even more unusual. However, by now, most everyone knows about Tourette's syndrome, inability to recognize faces, and savants with amazing abilities in music or math. In fact, there was one example where autistic twin brothers saw a box of toothpicks fall to the floor and almost instantaneously said, in unison, 111. Of course, this is a scene out of Rain Man. The movie must have borrowed from the book which predates it. What struck me most, though, was how brain science could seem so clinically precise yet still so remote and inscrutable. At one moment the author may say ""similar hyperosmia, sometimes paroxysmal, may occur in excited hyper-dopaminogic states,"" and in another offer ""globular clusters and nebulae of numbers whorling and evolving in an ever-expanding mental sky"" as explanation. Huh?Some may say that the more we understand of brain mechanics, cause and effect, chemical reactions, and modelable outcomes, the less room there is for things like free will and human spirit. This can be a depressing thought. Where's the romance in robotics? I still like to believe in something that proxies for a soul, though, even if it does reduce down to just hardware, software, and inputs. At least what each of us has is unique, and that's special enough. (Thanks, Susan, for your thoughts prompting this topic.)A book like this that helps us understand how the brain functions by showing how a damaged brain malfunctions still leaves a lot that's unexplained. In my view, neurology is asking new questions at a faster rate than it's answering old ones. I like it like that. Mysteries still abound."
25,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,3,"I was very taken with Dr. Saks' book Hallucinations, so I thought I would give this one a try....how could you go wrong with that title???It is collection of case histories of the author's patients who were afflicted with brain trauma to the right hemisphere which caused rather unusual symptoms and behaviors.. Indeed one of the patients mistook his wife for his hat and also tried to shake hands with a grandfather clock. Although the majority of neurology/neuropsychological studies concentrate on the left hemisphere, it is the right hemisphere which controls the crucial powers of recognizing reality; therefore the damaged individual may not recognize this faces of his friends/family or particular everyday objects. Or they might exhibit the symptoms of Karsokov's Syndrome in which they have no memory past a certain point in their lives and can't understand why people look ""so old"".These are interesting studies and some would actually be humorous if not so tragic. The reader will be helped in understanding the book by having a clinical/psychology background or familiarity with the field. There are some sections that are dry as dust but overall an informative book."

Frankly, I think it was the extraordinary title (and my lack of time) that made me grab it.All these years later, I remember it well. It was my first introduction to all sorts of bizarre psychological, psychiatric, and neurological conditions that are now more widely known to the general public, and left me amazed at the power and quirks of the human brain. And it was my first introduction to Sacks himself. Sacks could have presented a Victorian freak show in book form, and I did occasionally feel a twinge of guilt at my interest in such devastating personal medical problems (this was before Miserly Lit was big). But that's not what he wrote. This is sensitive, educational, affectionate, and, yes, amusing. Tragic, but never sentimental, Sacks writes with engaging charm. I think this is a force for good. "

Proper review to come at some point.Probably wouldn't recommend this if you're very new to neuroscience/psychology, though. The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons by Sam Kean is a much better place to start out imo."

""He both was and wasn't aware of this deep, tragic loss in himself, loss of himself. If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self -himself- he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.""
If you enjoy medical case histories that are sensitive yet lively, weird but informative, then Sacks' book is your ticket.A neurologist that will fascinate you with stories of patients like the man in the title: a professor who couldn't recognize faces and who patted the tops of fire hydrants believing them to be children. Sacks is no ordinary practitioner; his patients suffer from rare complaints like Korshakov's syndrome, Tourette's and other afflictions, some of which make the patient unsure of the reality of his own body. Their tragedies and their courage are joined with the author's astute professionalism and humanity to make for a riveting foray into the unknown. The history of these strange cases and the state of the art of medicine are deftly probed. Yet in the midst of all this tragedy, there is an eerie comic quality. Take the 80-year-old ex-prostitute who discovers a new liveliness and euphoria, which she enjoys immensely. However, the reason for this is a recurrence of an old syphilis infection. Does she want to be totally cured and lose this new found ebullience? Not really. She relishes ""Cupid's disease's"" strange excitation of her cerebral cortex too much. 💃🏻This book ranks with the very best of its genre. 👏🏼It will inform and entertain anyone, especially those who find medicine an intriguing and mysterious art."
30,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/149183-bell,5,"Very interesting neurological case studies that begged me to reconsider intelligence and ""normalcy"" particularly in terms of visual perception and its relationship to reality. Also fascinating was the profound structure that the arts (he specifically mentions music, dance, story-telling and drawing) provide for those with the inability to form or develop conceptual frameworks. Indeed, it seems that the fine arts aren't just high-concepts of beauty and art, but healing mechanisms crucial to many of his patients' feeling whole or, as he mentions, ""preserving [their] identity in adverse circumstances.""The brain is a fascinating subject, but the doctor's compassion and passion for his patients, for his field, is inspiring to say the least. This book has raised several questions for me in terms of viewing people for what or who they are rather than who they are not. It was far from clinical which is probably the reason this book seems to have become a classic. (My book was copyright 1985. It's been updated since then.)Love the book-will probably read again at some point. Hope to read his other books soon."
31,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela,3,"A music teacher is unable to recognize faces anymore and mistakes his foot for a shoe, his wife for a hat, and his only way to understand world remains music. A forty-nine-year-old man remembers his life until nineteen with amazing accuracy but forgets what he was doing 5 minutes ago. A woman wakes in the morning with the sensation she's disembodied and cannot move unless she watches the part of the body she wants to move. A young man finds a strange object in his bed that he refuses to acknowledge as his own foot. An old woman isn't aware of the left part of her body so she puts make-up only on the right part of her face. Another one imitates with an amazing speed the expressions of the people in the street. An almost deaf woman wakes up in the morning because of a loud Irish music which she eventually has to admit is playing only in her head. And so on, and so forth. Did you think Marquez, or Borges, or even Kafka? Think again! For this is life, people, not literature. However, what in literature is beautifully strange and oddly reassuring - in the end it's only imagination, isn't it? - in real life it's scary, weird - and the hypochondriac me found at least two or three symptoms on myself leading to a fatal neurological disease to freak me out! Funny enough, while reading in parallel Norwegian Wood I suddenly found plenty explanation (neurological ones, of course) behind all those suicides! 😊It seems that the intention of the book is to impose some archetypal figures for a new science: the neuro-psychology. My neurological knowledge is inexistent, my psychological one, next to, so I have no tool to judge the scientific aspect of the book, but as a novice I was fascinated by the cases presented and it even helped me to better understand some disease that I've heard of, such as Tourette's or autism. Maybe the author's revelations are not fascinating in the way Freud's were, because where Freud dismantled the mechanism of the conscience to reveal the depths of the subconscious, Sacks can only identify an organic disease, that changes human nature, it's true, but doesn't explain or helps to understand it.For my part, I relished learning some beautiful words (with not such beautiful meanings, however) as aphemia (inability to express ideas verbally ), alexia (inability to read), ataxia (inability to move), etc. I found it is an interesting idea and it stands to reason the hypothesis that the visions of the saints were often due to migraines and ⁄ or seizures.Finally, I appreciated the author's care for composition - the book is round - it begins with the story of a man who lost his concrete understanding of the world and it ends with the story of a young man who lost his abstract representation of the world."

I think it is the question about the nature of consciousness.and this book is a very good example to explain why.Oliver Sacks here demonstrates a vast squad of the most bizarre cases he has ever dealt with during his career as a clinical neuropsychologist…very distinguishable they are, we still can find a single feature shared among all of them: their minds are always craving to fill the gap in their consciousness (caused by Their defects) by using very distinctive ways….to put in a simpler form: our minds are coherence-seeking machines that are only interested in providing us(the conscious part of us)with a firm and consistent vision of the world even by fabricating the defective parts of it…this I a feature recorded in normal people(as when you try to remember a specific accident but can’t recall the all the details…so your brain uses the available parts and mixes them with some fake ones…VOILA!!You now a have a consistent story to tell)but it’s away more complex and creative in people with defective abilities of perception, processing or recalling information...This was my first read for Sacks and I have already put 5 other books of him on my to read list"
33,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie,1,"It is very unusual for me not to finish a book. I really thought I would have enjoyed this - a book of case studies from the field of neurology. The cases in and of themselves are fascinating, losses of memory and phantom limbs, stories of trial through adversity and considerations of what it means to be human. However....the telling of these stories is so cumbersome, loaded down with a lot of medical jargon and repetitive philosophical discourse. Some stories feel oddly attenuated - a quick survey of a case, no more than a few pages and then onto the next patient ...In addition I think this book, written in the 80s, is showing signs of it's age - I am pretty sure some of the terms used for patients would no longer be acceptable and something about the discussion of peoples souls seemed out of place in a book of science. Obviously just not the book for me."
34,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089478-jim,3,"A very well-written discussion of fascinating and, in some instances, very rare neurological syndromes. Recommended for those who are interested in the varied and often devastating effects of brain pathology on the human experience and quality of life. Dr. Sacks’ abiding concern for the welfare of his patients, and the long-term emotional trauma that many of them suffer, comes through very clearly in his prose. The depth of his insights into the patients’ mental states is also quite remarkable. With that said, some of the writing is highly technical, and some readers may find that annoying.My 3-star rating reflects disappointment in the generally ‘black-box’ treatment of brain structures implicated in these cases. I realize that most readers may not want that level of detail. But in these detailed case descriptions, there was an opportunity to help readers understand the intimate connection between brain systems and abnormal behavior. For me, it was a bit like a detailed description of the exotic flavors of a dish, with little or no description of the ingredients. (I should say that I have the original 1985 edition, and there may be more detailed coverage of brain mechanisms in later editions).Interestingly, Dr. Sacks comments in a recent New Yorker article (thanks to Lars for the reference) that he also suffers from the ‘face-blindness’ (prosopagnosia) that is featured in the title case for this book. I learned from neurosurgeons that neurological signs are present in about 30% of all patients who see primary-care physicians. Thus, case descriptions like these may have a relevance to everyday life that is not often discussed."
35,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,4,"I liked how this book presented the cases of neurological diseases and disorders as real people, not just mere vessels of the respective affliction. This was also what made it extremely sad, as it was impossible not to relate to their suffering. The story of the woman that lost her proprioception (the sense of knowing the position of your body), is what stuck with me the most in the whole book for some reason, maybe because her discussion with the author was so tragic. There is a part where she watches old videos of herself when she was healthy and capable to move without problems that reduced to tears. The other stories were also powerful, especially those in the first part of the book. The second part while retaining the same formula of presenting the person, then the affliction and what that means to them and how it affects their life so that in the end we discover some sort of ad-hoc treatment, relied heavily on medical terms and concepts that were at time quite difficult to grasp, so it made the reading less enjoyable but not less informative. I feel like the author should have provided more explanations for the general audience that is not that familiar with this scientific area. Despite that, this book is highly educational and provides a scary and terrifying report of what a diseased brain can do. I know I said in another review how much I am scared of prion diseases, but to be honest, any kind of neurological disorders scare the shit out of me."
36,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15698555-tanya,4,"I have a Master in Psychology, and throughout my studies, Oliver Sacks was a name I heard mentioned by virtually every single professor over the course of five years, most often in conjunction with this book. I've finally read it, and I can see why it's so universally appreciated—perhaps, if I'd read it sooner, at a different time in my life, I would've followed what I'd thought of as my chosen career path after all. You see, Dr. Sacks was the opposite of everything I came to dislike about clinical psychology, a field I thought made for me, but that my internships ultimately made me turn my back on. Sacks was a rarity in this profession, and embodied what I always thought a psychologist should be, but rarely is.A deeply closeted British gay man until he came out in his autobiography published the year he died, aged 82, he himself suffered from prosopagnosia, ""face blindness"", the same neurological condition afflicting the man from the titular essay of this collection. His writing is beautiful, and led the New York Times to dub him a ""poet laureate of contemporary medicine"", but that's not what made his essays and books special; it was the way he wrote about his patients. Psychology, especially neurology, is an obviously scientific and very technical field, but he didn't choose to write about his subjects in a clinical way. He recognized that neurological testing, as such, is a measurements of deficits; it can't appraise anything else. The privative language of his field struggles when it has to describe an excess, rather than a loss, of a function, and he takes issue with how psychological testing methods don't allow for the human beneath to shine through.
“If we wish to know about a man, we ask 'what is his story—his real, inmost story?'—for each of us is a biography, a story. Each of us is a singular narrative, which is constructed, continually, unconsciously, by, through, and in us—through our perceptions, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions; and, not least, our discourse, our spoken narrations. Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives—we are each of us unique.”
The book is split into four sections, and collects twenty-four essays (which vary wildly in length): Losses and Excesses particularly emphasize disorders of the right brain hemisphere, while Transports and The World of the Simple concern themselves with perceptual and intellectual anomalies. All of the cases presented are as interesting as they are bizarre, all of them are essentially centered around disorders that affect perception (of the self, others, or the world), and they all have in common that he writes about his patients in a very loving and compassionate way; in his own words, ""I love to discover potential in people who aren't thought to have any"".His non-judgemental and deeply empathetic writing frequently crosses the line into the spiritual, and he often threw around philosophical references that went over my head. He mentions a lot of neurological disorders in passing as well, expecting the reader to know what he's going on about, which must be quite confusing to a layperson, but was less of an issue in my case. Despite the very beautiful and humane writing that makes them suited for a general audience, these essays are still written by a scientist, and as such provide references and footnotes to academic papers, books, and related case studies, as is usual in scientific pieces. The essays touch on a great number of different neurological conditions, from visual agnosia, aphasia, Korsakoff's, impaired proprioception and phantom limbs, Tourette's, epilepsy, and autism, just to name a few from the essays that most stuck with me.Having been published in the mid-80s, some of the language, especially in the section on intellectual disabilities, is decidedly a left-over from a thankfully bygone time (although I want to stress that while the language is no longer accepted, it was commonplace then, and not viewed as offensive—Sacks certainly meant no harm). That, and the fact that there wasn't an afterword or epilogue of sorts to tie all of the essays together, are my only qualms with this book, which, at the time of its publication, managed to single-handedly renew the practice of case history as a literary form. Sacks provides stories of people struggling against incredible adversity that stems from inside their own heads, and pays tribute to their own unique ways of coping with their respective situation. With his sympathetic writing and deeply humane respect for the patients he chose to include, Sacks gifted us a humbling contemplation of the beauty of imperfection.—————All my book reviews can be found here · Buy on BookDepository"
37,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,3,"I read another Oliver Sacks book (An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales) several years ago, and see I liked it enough to give it four stars at the time. This is one of those reading-instances wherein I can remember exact places I read the book (on the bus when I worked at the bookstore), but now remember very little about the actual text. In fact, for a while afterwards, I could have sworn (and may have sworn to some of you) that the book by Sacks I had actually read was this one, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Whoops.As I delved into this one, I realized very quickly that I had not actually read it before, so I'm glad I decided not to sit out this month's book club selection on the pretense I thought I had read it already. Let this be a lesson to you, Self.The selection here is just as the title indicates - they are clinical tales, not essays. They are, for lack of a better term, case studies. Oliver Sacks was a neurologist who wrote several books on the weird things that go on inside one's brain. He had a lengthy career with working with patients, so it seems he always had examples to draw from for his books.I can see how much of this book would be tedious to read for a lot of readers. I think those who will get most out of this will be those who are naturally inclined to be interested in neurology or medicine, or those who have a clinical background. I do not necessarily have a clinical background, but the brain fascinates me, so I was able to appreciate these ""tales"" from that front. And even though I work in a medical environment and am pretty good with clinical or medical terminology, I still found my eyes glazing over a smidge at some of Sacks' ramblings.Additionally, some of these case studies are so short that they leave a lot to be desired by the reader. It's those moments that make me think that they might be better received in a medical journal or presented at a medical conference, but as part of a collection such as this, it leaves a distinct cold feeling for the rest of us.That being said, the brain is a really fucking interesting instrument. It's fairly obvious when a brain is working well, but when a brain is not working well, there's still a lot of head-scratching that occurs because the real question is why is not working the same way. There are multiple reasons for why a brain might go haywire - from trauma to sickness to medication to birth defects to environmental causes to watching too much Jersey Shore (not mentioned by Sacks in this collection, fyi). Sacks wrote about the people he met along the way whose brains didn't work quite the same way as others, and a lot of it is really fascinating. But I was left feeling with some of them that he could have explained in more detail for those of us laypeople.I am sad that Sacks is no longer with us, as I especially would have liked to see an updated version of this book, even with a new Preface or Introduction by the author. Published in the 80s, it's slightly outdated now with some of the terminology (luckily we don't use terms such as ""retards"" and ""idiots"" in the medical field anymore - at least not clinically-speaking...) and I'm sure there have been major medical and scientific advancements since this was published. In addition, there's likely a whole lot of other case studies Sacks could have included now... or perhaps even have given resolution to some of his past studies illustrated here.All in all I could appreciate the book solely because I dig atypical medical studies, but wish it had made a deeper impact on me during the reading itself."
38,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,1,"I am so angry right now. I can’t take another word of this self-righteous, ignorant, judgmental narrative masquerading as compassion. I am close to the end but I can’t bear to finish. I just want to fling my phone (I was taking the audiobook route) to the wall and scream, NO! NO! NO!!! These are people, not freaks, idiots, morons, retards!!! I know this is how it was in the seventies, but I am reading it now. And even in the seventies - how can a doctor clearly see extraordinarily abilities in someone, and still call them a retard and a freak, because some other abilities are lacking, and because they don’t understand where some behaviors (like tantrums) are coming from? (He is describing someone clearly on the autism spectrum.) You have someone with superhuman ability to remember and understand very complex nuances of music, and your conclusion is not that this person is smart and we misdiagnosed him, but that music does not require intelligence? Wtf is wrong with you???This last chapter is just an avalanche of belittling, terrible language. Defectives, retards, morons, simpletons, freaks. Just so derogatory. It seems too much of this language, and not just used as a clinical term. The blurb says Dr Sacks talks of people with compassion. Bullshit. Pity is not compassion. He is dripping with condescension, talking of everyone like “it is such a pity that their life is shattered”, always analyzing how terrible it is when this or that ability is missing. He even goes to the point of suggesting that some people with memory loss do not have a soul! WTF! He does not treat the “patients” as people, does not feel like he should help their strengths, special abilities flourish, help them live a full life. Again, I am aware that this was the seventies. But that does not make it right.This book is dated to the point of blood-boiling. It is not a book we should still be reading. I can’t recommend it to anyone in the 21st century."
39,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287915-name-redacted,4,"A gorgeously-written and accessible introduction to the world which straddles the line between neurology and psychology. Sacks is a literate, artistically-minded man (who had a fondness for drugs himself, though he doesn't explicitly discuss that in this book) and helped revolutionize the psychological case study by focusing on his patients' abilities and adaptations rather than their disabilities and stagnations. It's an artefact of its time, so some of the information is no longer current and some of the words betray its 1970s/1980s context, but the only real weaknesses are the oddly abrupt ending and the chapter in which he betrays his own political bias and then projects it onto a room full of aphasiacs. Other than that? Beautiful.Notably, it contains what I have long considered the best description of mania I've ever encountered (excepting, of course, Billy Joel's ""I Go To Extremes""):""'I have too much energy,' one...said. 'Everything is too bright, too powerful, too much. It is a feverish energy, a morbid brilliance.' 'Dangerous wellness', 'morbid brilliance', a deceptive euphoria with abysses beneath -- this is the trap promised and threatened by excess... The human dilemmas, in such situations, are of an extraordinary kind: for patients are here faced with disease as seduction, something remote from, and far more equivocal than, the traditional theme of illness as suffering or affliction... In disorders of excess there may be a sort of collusion, in which the self is more and more aligned and identified with its sickness, so that finally it seems to lose all independent existence, and be nothing but a product of sickness.""(First read in 2000 - re-read in 2012)"
40,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1674976-jim,4,"Hmmm.. what to say, what to say...I did enjoy reading Sacks' observations and perceptions of his patients ('clients') with their various - and quite bizarre - ailments and conditions, but only on the level of intellectual curiosity.On another (visceral?) level my reactions were much more complex and I'm not entirely sure I can communicate effectively how reading this book made me feel.Trying to analyse these feelings, I had an enormous empathy for the souls concerned and was greatly moved by their predicaments; invariably finding it impossible to comprehend just how irretrievably their lives had altered as a result of their afflictions.I felt pity for them too and in so doing often experienced a mixture of shame (why, I can't really articulate) and more than a touch of fear - 'there but for the grace' et cetera.I'm glad that I've at last had the opportunity to read some Sacks, but I don't think this overly sensitive, imaginative, borderline hypocondriac will be reading anymore.It did remind me of a quote, I forget who from, that ""We do not have souls - we are souls; we have a body"" which is a bit Ghost in the Machine isn't it? I only realised recently just how clever that Sting chappie is *grin*"
41,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64630449-traceyl,3,"Interesting look at the brain and the weird things it makes us do. This book talks about many cases of neurological patients who are exhibiting strange behaviors. The titular character can't tell the different between objects and people; another man wakes up one morning an believes someone has replaced his left leg with a stranger's; a woman forgets everything to the left of her exists, only putting makeup on the right side of her face or eating food on the right side of her plate. It got a little dry near the end, but I got some good facts out of it."
42,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,5,"This book was a fascinating read. One of the best books I've read in a very long time. I would recommend this book to whomever is interested in neurology, psychology and the human mind. I read this book little by little in a fairly long period of time. Mainly because I needed time to thing about what I read, sometimes because I needed to work a little bit to understand the more technical parts of the book and lately, in these last few days, because I was very busy. The book is about people with psycho-neurological disorders and deficits. Every chapter begins by explaining -in a fairly detailed way for a non-technical book- the history and conditions of the deficit and how much neurological science has done to understand it and how far it has come, then the author gives an overview of some of the most peculiar cases, and then goes on to tell the story of each patient individually; how he came in contact with them, what their exact conditions were, the reasons for their neuro-psychological problems and whether they could be cured (which often is not the case), there is also a postscript to every study which follows the patient and their progress after they were treated. What is note worthy about this book is how the writer portrays the human side of every individual, even when there seems to be very little 'human' left to be seen. The writer's multidimensional look at human psyche, instead of a simple 'by the book' look, coupled with his undeniable knowledge of his field is often the reason for his successful diagnosis of the presented cases. This inevitably leads to the improvement of patient's life. At first I wrote briefly about the cases presented in the book, but then I deleted them. Every one of them made me wonder about the brain and how complicated and amazing its inner working is, and at the same time I was scared that I would one day wake up and be a stranger to my body or start hearing music playing in my head all the time, or lose all the powers of abstraction (all cases from the book). It's amazing what your brain is doing when your not even aware of it, and if you had to do it consciously, it would prove to be extremely difficult if not impossible (also presented in one of the cases). As Wittgenstein says ""The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and their familiarity. The real foundations of his inquiry do not strike a man at all."" We, sometimes need books like this to remind us how fortunate we are.For me the case of 'The Lost Mariner' was the most tragic and heart wrenching of them all. It's the story of the man who has a severe Korsakov's Syndrome, which is a form of Alzheimer disease. A 40 year old man who can't remember anything from a few seconds ago. Everything is constantly strange and new; places, faces, people, everything. This becomes more tragic when you realize that he's not even aware of his condition; There are no memories and therefore as a result there is no 'self'. Oliver Sacks had this encounter with the patient about how he felt which made a big impact on me: One day I asked him not about his memory, or past, but about the simplest and most elemental thing of all:'How do you feel?''How do I feel?' he repeated an scratched his head. 'I cannot say I feel ill. But I cannot say I feel well. I cannot say I feel anything at all. 'Are you miserable?' I continued.'I can't say I am.''Do you enjoy life?''I can't say I do.''How then do you feel about life?''I can't say that I feel anything at all.''You feel alive though?''Alive? Not really. I haven't felt alive for a very long time.'That's it. I think this turned out to be a pretty long review. I won't say anymore. Just that this is a wonderful book. Read it. You won't regret it. "
43,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"There are half a dozen books that I have been profoundly influenced by. Three come quickly to mind, although there are others: Diary of Anne Frank (I learned about both great suffering and goodness in the midst of suffering), Thoreau's Walden (there are other ways of living), and Recipes for a Small Planet (there are other ways of eating). Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat was another, as it taught me how to see people, to recognize that people may have strengths despite profound weaknesses.This rereading didn't open profoundly new ways of seeing things, but Sacks' passion about the people he worked with is still inspiring, his ways of seeing with fresh eyes reminded me of how the medical field often falls short of really listening and listening with heart.Sacks listened to each of the men and women that he wrote about with empathy and presence. Most of us turn away with embarrassment when people's bodies betray them. Oliver Sacks listened. He tried different things and different situations, which allowed him to see, to hear, to recognize. He noticed the things that Dr. P could not recognize, but also those things that he did recognize and could still do. About a man with Korsakoff's: It was not, apparently, that he failed to register in memory, but that the memory traces were fugitive in the extreme, and were apt to be effaced within a minute, often less, especially if there were distracting or competing stimuli, while his intellectual and perceptual powers were preserved, and highly superior. (p. 27).Although Sacks did not study himself in this way in this book, he did in others, A Leg to Walk on being one such. This is the mark of a profoundly curious human.Part of what makes Sacks' writing so compelling is that he saw the individual, but he also saw the greater pattern. He asked questions: What sort of a world, what sort of a self, can be preserved in a man who has lost the greater part of his memory and, with this, his past, and his moorings in time? (p. 23).Or,If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it. (pp. 35-36). Sacks recognized that the person was not the syndrome and that different people may experience the same disease state, but feel it differently. Witty Ticcy Ray, for example, was better off with his tics – at least when they were moderated. He was more creative, a better drummer, and had more fun. Some people could ‘take’ Tourette’s, and accommodate it within a commodious personality, even gaining advantage from the swiftness of thought and association and invention which went with it, while others might indeed be ‘possessed’ and scarcely able to achieve real identity amid the tremendous pressure and chaos of Tourettic impulses (pp. 92-93). On the other hand, Witty Ticcy Ray found Haldol was deadening (antipsychotics are not a pretty drug). It removed his tics, but made life not worth living. Ray and Sacks worked together to discover a way of handling his medication that worked. This takes trust on the part of both physician and patient.I know that Oliver Sacks died, but I think of his death as recent. I had to remind myself that he did not die this year, but in 2015. I think of Sacks in the present tense, where he lived."

Sacks divides this book into four sections: Losses, Excesses, Transports, and The World of the Simple. The sections follow their descriptors. In Losses, Sacks describes some patients who present with somewhat bizarre neurological deficits. In Excesses, his ""clients"" suffer from other neurological disorders that appear to be a superabundance of function. The third section, Transports, is the most interesting and the hardest to describe. Sacks encounters patients who have suffered a variety of illnesses which have resulted in a variety of seizures with effects that must be read to be believed. I find this section fascinating because it seems that Sacks stares down Laplace's demon. One section (Reminiscence) even cites a study in which an epileptic patient underwent treatment where seizures were stimulated in precise portions of the brain which resulted in specific memories being called up to be re-lived. Nonetheless, Sacks seems to want to go against a pernicious reductionist scientific determinism. He is almost as likely to cite Thomas Mann or Jorge Luis Borges as he is Hughlings Jackson or A. R. Luria. The final section, though written in language that may sound offensive in today's climate exhibits an uncommon sensibility and attention to his patients with intellectual disabilities. His chapter ""Twins"" is thoroughly engrossing. No spoilers. This is a good, quick read. Do it. 3.5/5"

While the cases it presents may still be interesting for those in the profession to analyze, people reading from a less professional perspective will find nothing of any worth. This book is so full of horrifying 1970's style racism (comparing ""savages"" to children and ""retards"" and ""simpletons"", calling cases retardeds, simpletons, idiots, and worse, etc) that while some of the information may still be valid today, I cannot take a single word of it seriously. If the author took the time to read and write a forward for the audio edition, why on earth didn't he take the time to go through the text, and at least update some of the worst blunders? Yes, I realize time and language have changed. But that's no reason to perpetuate historical mistakes in what is sold as a popular psych book, especially not when the author is alive and well and could update the text."

Who would we be if one part or the other of our neurological system cannot function as it should be?I am sure Oliver Sacks treated far more cases throughout his life than the ones he wrote about in this book, but these, I presume, were the most curious of all. Neurology is such a complex field, and one cannot, of course, summarise it in a few pages. Oliver Sacks was not trying to recount medical records empty of life, he describes the cases in a very lively and subjective way and not simply as a doctor would speak of his patients. But, I would have appreciated it more if Sacks made a bit of effort to explain some of the medical jargon he used, though I truly believe that the terms come to him naturally and does not feel the need to define and explain, missing out on the fact that there will be, among the readers of this book, people who know little to nothing of the medical field.Very interesting cases that make one wonder what wonders are yet to be discovered in the human brain."

However, others are extremely clinical and even boring in the way Sacks conveys them, though the stories are objectively fascinating.Overall this is a wonderful book, in the sense of containing astounding marvels of the human condition, but due to the collection's uneven telling and overuse of medical jargon and explanations, it wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. There were a few times I almost fell asleep while reading it - it was that boring."
48,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801284-j-c,4,"I came across an old reading journal, where I summarized each of the stories in this intruiging book:A collection of stories about patients with neurological disorders—strange, unique, and human.“The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat”—Dr. P cannot recognize faces or visual images. His brain is deteriorating in a way that causes him to see only individual features and not the whole. He can only keep at a task by singing, and if he’s interrupted, he forgets everything.“The Lost Mariner”—A 49-year old man cannot remember anything past the mid-1940s, and he always thinks he is 19. He can’t hold any thought for more than a few seconds, although he is very sharp. He has no real emotions, since he can’t really remember anything, but he seems to find peace when he gardens.“The Disembodied Lady”—A once-healthy woman suddenly loses all sense of proprioception”—her sense of self and where her body is. She has to relearn walking, etc., by watching all her movements (so she knows where everything is). “The Man Who Fell Out of Bed”—A man who thinks someone has attached a fake leg to his body tries to throw it out of bed—but realizes it is his own. He cannot recognize it, or feel it, but he cannot think where his own leg might be. It is like a dead leg.“Hands”—60 year old blind woman with cerebral palsy cannot do anything with her hands because they feel like lumps of dough. She is taught, however, to recognize things by touch, and finally she learns to sculpt. She reveals her true talent as an artist, and proves that others with her problem can also be cured.“Phantoms”—A phantom is the sensation of feeling a limb is still intact, even after it has been amputated. This can sometimes be painful, dangerous, or even helpful. It is nearly impossible to teach an amputee to walk again if there is no sensation that a leg still exists. This is not one, but several short examples.“On the Level”—A dynamic 93-year old man with Parkinson’s disease doesn’t realize he is walking at a tilted 20-degree angle. He fixes the problem ingeniously, however, by designing a special pair of glasses that work as a spirit level, just as in carpentry. He can tell when he’s walking straight.“Eyes Right”—Having suffered a massive stroke that affected her right cerebral hemisphere, a woman in her 60s no longer has a concept of “left.” She cannot look left and only makes up half of her face. When shown a video image of herself, she can see her left, but it is disturbing to her since she cannot feel it.“The President’s Speech”—Aphasiacs cannot understand words as such, but they can recognize utterance well enough to understand almost completely what was said to them. This is why they found the president’s speech so funny—they understood what he was saying better than those who understood he words. “Witty Ticcy Ray”—A victim of Tourette’s since 4, Ray cannot imagine a life without his sudden, violent tics. They keep him sharp-witted, quick, and brilliant at percussion and ping-pong. He briefly tries the drug Haldol but is discouraged to find it slows him down and prevents him from being himself. For 3 months, he imagines life without Tourette’s, and when he tries the drug again, it works ‘miraculously.’ But because he misses his ‘freedom,’ he does not take the drug on weekends—and leads a stable life.“Cupid’s Disease”—Having contracted syphilis 70 years ago, and having it treated but not eradicated, Mrs. K suddenly feels younger, livelier, and “frisky.” Rather than having it treated, however, she chooses to remain feeling young. Another man experiencing this excited stage of neurosyphilis is very animated. After being given Haldol to quiet him down, he lost his animation and energy.“A Matter of Identity”—Mr. Thompson cannot identify anyone correctly, so he makes up fictional characters and recognizes people as such. He also cannot accurately remember anything, and so he creates a past of fiction. He is like Jimmie in “The Lost Mariner” with Korsakov’s, but the only time he seems at peace is when he’s by himself and doesn’t need to make up stories.“Yes, Father-Sister”—Although very smart, Mrs. B developed an irreversible indifference to the world. She knew the difference between right and left, but it didn’t mean anything to her.“The Possessed”—The story relates the author’s experience of seeing a “Super Touretter” in the streets of NYC. The woman mimicked every person she saw, but was incapable of creating any gestures of her own. She lacked her own personality and was eaten away by Tourette’s."

A man literally thinks his wife is his hat; a set of twins appears retarded in every other way but can calculate six-digit prime numbers; temporal lobe seizures manifest as individuals hearing music from their past that no one is playing. Sacks, though, is far more sensitive and profound than that. He always views his subjects as human, not as clinical case material. He uses their experiences to entertain deep questions, particularly how does one's having a soul jive with our increasing ability to locate neurological bases for our idiosyncrasies? Are we simply the sum total of our neurology, or is there a self beyond our wiring? How do we handle exceptions to our preconceived notions about brain disorders, such as an autistic man who seems mechanical and concrete about everything else but exhibits creativity and humor when drawing?Although I wouldn't call this book an easy read, I don't think you need to be a neurology or psychology person to appreciate it. The fascinating descriptions of brain disorders and compensation and the questions raised are relevant to everyone."

It was pretty interesting, a good collection of curiosities. Most of the disorders I haven't heard of before and could hardly imagine.What I disliked:- For me, it wasn't anything more than a collection of curiosities. It didn't lead to a better understanding of how the brain works or any particular insight into ""the human experience"".- Some of the stories were very short, consisted only of the description of the strange behavior of the patient, without a reason causing it, diagnosis or the possibility of treatment. They lacked resolution.- The events described happened in 1960-70-ies, and some of the contemplations seem outdated and out of place. Multiple times the author wonders if the brain-damaged patients of his have a soul and discusses this with nurses. Like, dude."

With age comes skepticism; I see this work, unfortunately, as more a commercial product than an attempt to evolve our understanding.I've already come to appreciate reality as very much an individual experience. It comes as no surprise that persons with impaired or altered mental function should experience realities that substantially deviate from the norm. I feel Dr. Sacks is participating in a form of voyeurism, rather than advancing science. Where is the evidence that Dr. Sacks has cured or materially improved the afflictions of his patients? No, Dr. Sacks' skill rests in writing of strange behaviors, enrapturing the reader, much as a carnival visitor of yore was enraptured with the world's tallest or shortest man. Three stars."

The book could be great if an editor helped Sacks focus which on style he going for - whether it’s a medical/academic style with the needed arguments as to why, whichever treatment he used were used, or a much more quirky and simple anecdotal layperson style. He fails at both."

54,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4929450-amanda,3,"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is a book by neurologist Oliver Sacks describing unique ""disabilities"" of some of his patients. Some of the case histories included in his book were: a man who could see but lost the ability to recognize and interpret visual information; twin brothers who could not complete simple equations, yet could spontaneously generate prime numbers from six to twenty digits; a woman who completely forgot the idea of ""left"" relative to her own body and the world around her; and a man who thought his leg belonged to someone else. The book comprised twenty-four essays divided into four categories, based on a particular aspect of brain function (Losses, Excesses, Transports, and The World of the Simple). The third and fourth sections describe unbidden recollections, altered perceptions, and amazing feats of mind found in people with intellectual disabilities.Dr. Sacks's case studies shed light on baffling afflictions that were not well understood at the time of publication. They were both interesting and informative to a lay reader like me. However, after each case study, he went quite a bit in depth into scientific lingo and was above my head. Frankly, it was boring to someone who does not work in the field of neurology.I commend Dr. Sacks for seeking out the talents and abilities of mentally challenged individuals that were and are still overlooked. He admitted that evaluations for these individuals only deficits, not advantages. He realized that some of his clinic's initiative drives didn't work because they ""drove [patients] full-tilt upon their limitations, as had already been done, futilely, and often to the point of cruelty throughout their lives."" Some of the cures doctors of his generation had undertaken had removed a person's genius, ""leaving nothing behind but a general defectiveness."" He came to the conclusion that some patients won't thrive unless they have a mentor with understanding, patience, opportunity, and means who is willing to teach and engage.Although I understand that this book was written in 1985, I am appalled by the language both Sacks and his colleagues used to describe these individuals (retardates, mentally defective, simpletons, moron, fool, idiot, cognitive mishaps, Institute of Defectology). It was almost like he was trying to collect all of the most degrading names he could find. It seems like society has come a long way in how we refer to individuals with different abilities. I just wish the journey had been full of more compassion and understanding and less pain and humiliation for these patients.Overall, I enjoyed this book."

56,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,5,"I loved this book, the stories were told with care and with compassion - you can tell the author/doctor who worked with these people gave this book a lot of thought, and was very respectful. Sometimes when you read books like this the author is cold and distant, describing Patient A with XYZ symptoms due to whatever disease they have. It leaves you rather removed from the consequences to individuals lives who have been affected by these diseases. Other times, they can read like a circus freak parade, almost making a spectacle out of the patients - I'm so glad this book was neither of those. The patient's stories were truly fascinating, and at times heartbreaking. I think my favorite story was about an older woman who had just hit 90 years old, she was experiencing a new drive for life, her sex drive was up, her attitude was better and less gloomy, and she had much more energy than normal. It turned out that she had an old infection of syphilis that had just recently become active after years of being dormant. But the interesting thing was that she didn't want it cured, she just didn't want it to progress, she was enjoying her end of life boost from a deadly disease. Absolutely fascinating. I highly recommend this for people who like medical mysteries, and deeply interesting stories about people dealing with neurological diseases. "

I especially recall being taken to a place where autistic children lived...though when I asked my father about this earlier today he couldn't confirm for me that this was so.This was the first Sacks I read and it really brought home to me how lucky we'd been to have parents who instilled in us the virtue of seeing life as Sacks sees it. He celebrates the idea that something which so easily could be seen as a negative, a deficiency, in fact turns out to be the thing that gives somebody a special way of being in the world.If only everybody believed that. Instead in one of the stories in this book, siblings who communicate in prime numbers are separated from each other in an attempt to force them to relate to the world in a conventional way.

In all honesty, though, that's probably due to the fact that I listened to the audio of the book and the narrator had a very professor like cadence. So, while the subject matter and ideas were interesting, I couldn't help but feel like I was sitting in a lecture hall. However, that's not going to influence my rating as that is not necessarily a bad thing. The conclusion I reached after finishing this account is that the world is made up of music and numbers that only few are privileged enough to experience. The ""normal"" mind can't comprehend the world as such, but the exceptional can. I want to see the world, if only for a moment, through their eyes. "

63,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,2,"Yes, I read this book because of the awesome title. Also, I love neuroscience. I wanted to like this book so badly, but I did not enjoy it very much.In The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, Dr. Sacks features patients with different neurological conditions. And this is not an abstract work - it is personal. In the past, trying to understand a patient as more than their symptoms and diagnoses was commonplace. But in recent years, this practice has gone out of style. By using an unconventional treatment approach, Sacks wants other physicians to understand that practicing neurology in a discrete, quantifiable way ignores other aspects of the human condition. Also, by sharing his patients stories, he hopes the public will see neurological disorders in a new way. Not just as a deficit, but as an enhancement. He never romanticizes having an illness and acknowledges that in most cases, being sick does more harm than good. But he wants to be optimistic. For instance, some of his patients with intellectual disabilities have prodigious talents in math, art, or music. Despite the great content of this book, I think this book is just not for me. I kept glimpsing at the page numbers, waiting for this book to be over, and I feel bad saying this because Oliver Sacks is a great neurologist. I wish more physicians stopped looking at their patients with a medical gaze. I rather be a whole person than ""21-year-old Asian woman with reoccurring seizures"". My problem with this book was the writing. It felt unedited and rough. It had an air of affectation. There were so many run-on sentences and unnecessary synonyms. If this book had clearer prose, I would have given it a perfect rating. Despite the outdated information, it would have been interesting to see how physicians treated neurological disorders in the 80s. But the overly flowery rhetoric was too much for me. Also, if you lack a background in psychology, medicine or neuroscience, then this book will be hard to understand. Sacks uses terms like “proprioception”, “agnosia”, and “apraxia” without hesitating to explain what they mean. I thought this was confusing because most medical books present complex information in a way that is easy to understand, or they give an index at the end. But Sacks does neither. If you want to read a book that is similar to this one, but with clearer prose, I would recommend anything by Joe Dispenza, Norman Doidge, or Gabor Mate. All these writers feature clinical case studies, but break down the information in a way that is easier to understand."

I am generous with my reviews, especially with the books I love and that have affected me deeply. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales is one such book. Oliver Sacks is a nonfiction writer with the eye of a novelist. His writing is so human and so humane. In The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, he writes about curious mental ailments he discovered in his practice, and he did so with such humor and warmth that hardly anyone reading the tales could not appreciate them. I'm sick to hear about his dying of cancer. I believe his books will be remembered as classics of our age. He's undoubtedly an accomplished physician, and certainly the same quality which makes him an effective neurologist also makes him a great writer. He's a storyteller of the highest order, and like all great writers, his focus on the particulars of his subjects offers the reader a deeper understanding of the human condition.Awakenings was a fine movie and a fine book. One of the most touching movies about a father/ son relations is ""The Music Never Stopped"" based on Oliver Sacks's case study ""The Last Hippie."" It's a movie set in the mid-80s. It features an estranged son who has a brain tumor, and whose surgery causes him to become catatonic. (view spoiler)[...His father (the awesome JK Simmons) is a Vietnam vet who wants to reconnect with his son, so Simmons' character begins listening to the Grateful Dead and his son comes to life. It is only through music that they are able to reconnect. (hide spoiler)] It's exactly the kind of story that Sacks has been so brilliant at telling. I could write a novel about what Sacks has meant to me, but I won't do it here. I'll only say that if you haven't read his work, then you ought to (and you won't regret a minute of it). Here's a good quote from the NYT piece published today, Feb 19, 2015, about his eminent death:""...for it is the fate — the genetic and neural fate — of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death."""

I can't even imagine (nor that I want to) what these people went through or what are the feelings, the understanding (or the lack of it) behind the appearance and behavior induced by the specific disease. I was simply appalled by some of the cases.The writing style is not very accessible; although some medical terms are explained in footnotes or in the phrase which contains it, I had to look for a lot of others in dictionary.

70,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23106940-mia,2,"I hate to rate this book so low, because the content was very intriguing. My favourite case study was of a man who, after a severe car crash, completely lost his sense of smell. After a year or so of being distraught by this loss- he said that only in his lack of smell could he realise how profound the often-overlooked sense truly was- he began, to his joy, to begin to smell things again. His coffee, his pipe, the spring air. Happy but also somewhat perplexed, the man visits his neurologist, who tells him that he still has absolutely no sense of smell, and that his anosmia is as total and incurable as it was before. It later comes to light that the way he became able to smell again was that he wasn't actually ever able to smell again- his brain, with a store of every scent he'd ever smelled in all his years of living- learned to supply him with these scents. Basically, since he had smelled the scent of springtime and flowers for nearly thirty years, his brain compensated for his abrupt loss of smell by supplying him with ""scent-memories"", and trick him into thinking he'd regained his olfactory sense. Another case in this book, ""A Passage to India"", is especially interesting and touching.But, getting back to my review, the vast majority of cases that Dr. Sacks brings up are immensely fascinating; the only problem is his writing style. It is so strange, so stilted, that you'll almost definitely have to read certain sentences more than once to figure out what they mean. Sacks doesn't understand when to italicise and has a strange sense for punctuation. (I wish I had the book here to find examples, but I've since returned it back to my local library.)Also, Dr. Sacks seems to make three large assumptions of the reader in this book, which are largely (but not totally) untrue:1. That we have a working knowledge of neurological phrases and processes. This was perhaps the most annoying assumption that Sacks made. For instance, he will use the word apraxia twenty times, never enough to clarify it, and only tell you what it means in the last sentence of the chapter. Things like this happen over and over again, in different fashion. It often manifests as Sacks dropping a super-long neurological word- oh, say, a word like adrenoleukodystrophy- and NEVER EXPLAINING IT. Normally I wouldn't be annoyed by not knowing words in books (that's what dictionaries are for, after all) but it irked me here because there's no way the casual reader would know what these terms mean.2. That we own and have read all of the books he makes reference to. This happens quite a bit. Sacks will mention something- a disease, perhaps- and then tell the reader to look on page 247 of A.R. Luria's groundbreaking book [insert title here] to clarify the term. I mean, come on! It's not like I've got all of these books just sitting here next to me, to peruse through at Dr. Sacks' recommendation!3. That we are reading the book in a non-linear fashion. Sacks often refers to future and previous chapters, which wouldn't be an issue if he didn't do it so damn often. He often refers to the previous chapter, which is curious because, well, you just read it. How poor s the average reader's short-term memory?So, overall, it's a shame that this book was marred by the bizarre but well-meaning writing, because its content was utterly fascinating. I just got Dr. Sacks' new book,  Musicophilia, for my birthday, and as a music-lover and pianist with a passion for neuroscience I will most definitely read it- I just hope Sacks' writing style doesn't make it too unbearable."
71,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9438517-brent,1,"Dr. Sacks is a neurologist who wants to be a philosopher. Unfortunately for us readers, he did not want to be a writer. This makes for frustrating reading and a violation of the cardinal rule of writing: know your audience. If you are also a neurologist who wants to be a philosopher and you have old fashioned ethics, then this is your book! If, like most people, you are not, then prepare for medical jargon coupled with esoteric allusions embedded in stories that ramble on and on until they abruptly end.Dr. Sacks will examine how the human spirit is affected by the medical condition at hand, and this is fascinating at first. Amnesia and other rare psychological disorders have been milked fantastically by Hollywood, so simply telling the true version would make for a compelling read. Unfortunately, Dr. Sacks tries to get at the human spirit of the patient, and this leads to pulling in Kant, Hume (""Humean being"" was easily my favorite unintended pun in the book), Wittgenstein and others as a springboard for lengthy ramblings about the nature of humanity and what makes us human. These ramblings often trail off into a series of questions for the reader, not unlike a sophomore philosophy essay.Worse yet, multiple stories lack an ending. For instance, we only hear about the one night of a man who suddenly believes that his left leg is not his own. Fascinating story, but we don't know if he snaps out of it the next day or saws it off later that night! The story just ends. Often times the ending is vague and consists of the person doing alright all things considered.Multiple times Dr. Sacks will reference specific works of fiction or his own jargon (""incontinent nostalgia"" comes up many times before the chapter that defines it) and how this person is just like a character or situation in ""Funes the Memorious"" by Borges, or ""The Door in the Wall"" by HG Welles or the L-Dopa patients in Dr. Sack's other book. These stories are never summarized, so you will want an encyclopedia handy, otherwise you'll be missing out. The most frustrating instance of this is the entirety of chapter 9, which discusses two interpretations of a presidential speech without ever telling us anything about the speech!However, there is one thing that kept me reading for as long as I did: the glimpse into the mind of old doctor ethics. This is a time when, ""Give it to me straight, Doc."" was necessary, as Dr. Sacks often does not tell the patient what is wrong. In the title story, when asked by the Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, ""What's wrong with me?"", Dr. Sacks dodges the question! We also get to see the archaic system of care for the mentally handicapped, as we meet a woman who has literally never done anything for herself because of her Parkinson's and a caretaker who flatly says, ""He's an idiot. Don't even ask him. [...] They say he's 'autistic', but he is just an idiot.""Caveat lector!"
72,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The title makes this sound… odd. It made me worry that we were going to end up laughing at the plight of people with neurological disorders and defects, the first time I heard of it. But I was assured that Sacks was, overall, a decent guy, so I decided I probably should give it a try — especially since it’s one of those books that everyone seems to associate with neurology. Some of Sacks’ language is horribly out of date now (it’s jarring to read about ‘retardeds’, etc, even if the word was more acceptable then and had a medical meaning), and I can sympathise with people who felt that some of the language was too technical — it wasn’t to me, but I’ve had plenty of exposure.I think it mostly avoided the ‘freak circus’ effect, with a kind of tenderness about most of the cases described. One or two points I disliked were when Sacks tries to decide whether or not amnesiac people are ‘de-souled’ — so dehumanising and just… not appealing — and one where he made a kind of connection with a patient, or thought he had, and then immediately pulled back to avoid… what? Communicating honestly with a patient, getting into their world a little bit? Maybe I would see that differently as a doctor, but reading it, I couldn’t help but think what an opportunity was missed.Not all of the cases are fully described here, with the ins and outs and whys and wherefores; sometimes a diagnosis is assumed. But it is an interesting account of the many ways the human brain can go wrong, and the unexpected effects it can have.Originally posted here."

The personal tales contain a strong emotive element often absent from modern 'brain' books which was refreshing (albeit with the concerns mentioned above) "

The writing is uneven: very accessible sometimes, particularly in the first section, but the articles are also dotted with a lot of medical terminology and references that will be obscure to the average reader.Some reviewers complain of the author's arrogance and patronizing attitude, but I didn't get that impression at all. He is obviously fascinated by his patients, but he's also moved by their impairments and concerned with improving their quality of life.This book was first published in 1970, and the last section in particular feels dated, with clinical references to impaired patients as retardates, idiots and morons."

A Note: I watched Reagan on YouTube speechifying, and now see that old sick people do have some wisdom, even when they can no longer express themselves.

Bottom line: This is one of the best books I've ever read, for it opened my eyes to a world I didn't know much about as well as to a world I had marginally lived in, but had never understood much of. It taught me about identity as narrative and the effect of mental illness on this narrative. It answered some of my biggest life questions; it made me more empathetic and even optimistic.
----------Oliver Sacks died one year ago, on August 30, 2015. Recently, just after the first anniversary of Sacks' death, the writer Bill Hayes, Oliver Sacks' partner for the last six years of his life, wrote an article in the New York Times about Oliver and two episodes in his life where he briefly engaged with the Black Lives Matter movement and when he went to a gay bar who was celebrating his birthday. Time and again, the theme of extreme shyness emerges from the article. Oliver Sacks is said to have been so awkward and shy that his father was in disbelief when he heard his son had written a book.Born in London in a Jewish family with a tradition in sciences and medical studies, his father being a physician and his mother being one of the first female surgeons in England, Oliver Sacks studied medicine at Oxford where he was also a researcher, then moved to the United States where he studied Neurology in California, in San Francisco, then in Los Angeles, before moving to the East Coast, in New York City for the rest of his life. That he was extremely talented in sciences and neurology would be the second major thing that can be said.The third is that he was obsessed with sports and would hold a record in body building at some point in his youth. After he started living in New York city, he would stop body building but continue swimming every day, for his entire life. When he was 18, he confessed to his father that he was gay. When his mother found out, she severely berated him, saying he was ""an abomination."" It is not known whether that was a reason for Sacks' introversion and perhaps for his self-imposed celibacy that lasted decades, the first partner after being Bill Hayes himself, who is going to publish a book this year—""Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and me.""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is Oliver Sacks' most famous book—he wrote about fifteen, and consists of 24 stories about people with different alterations of the brain function. The first part, Losses, is about completely losing brain function, like the ability to see faces or any complex objects (like spaces and scenes) in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, the ability to recollect anything after a certain moment in one's life in The Lost Mariner, proprioception in The Disembodied Lady, awareness of a part of your body, like a limb, which then becomes estranges and undesired. Sometimes, these functions are regained; in Hands, the ability to integrate sensation into perception is healed, whereas in Phantoms, you never lose perception of a limb that you don't have any more (like an amputated leg) which helps with prosthetic limbs. Sometimes you can lose your body's ability to stand straight and therefore yo keep your balance, to which the patient in On the Level finds a solution by incorporating a small level, on the model of a carpenter's spirit level into one's glasses.Some people, I found out, lose their ability to understand the meaning of words. But because the semantic content of an utterance is just a small part of speech, if they can still understand the non-verbal baggage like tone, voice, and emotion, you might never realize that they don't understand your exact words. You can never lie to these people. There are other people who will never understand tone or feeling, so they'll be left with the content of your speech.The most stunning idea I gained from this first part was the concept of proprioception. Your body's ability to see itself. We navigate space using our sight, our vestibular systems (in our ears), and proprioception, through which your hand knows where your leg is if you have your eyes closed. If you lose this, you will need to move using only sight and balance, so you'll be like a robot that has to look at his body moving. Excesses. After discussing dysfunctions and deficits, which classic neurology deals a lot with, the second part talks about different cases of hyperactivity in cognitive function. A woman with Tourette's described in The Possessed, is able to imitate the expression and body language of all passers-by on a New York city street to the extent that she becomes occupied by a different self which brings her to exhaustion. In some of these cases, the disease presents itself as seduction at first, then this overgrowth of the workings of the mind becomes overwhelming and turns into affliction. A woman whose spirit was dull, acquires syphilis, which awakens her love for life and for young men! She notes, at the onset of her disease, ""I am feeling so well, something must be wrong.""My favourite story in this part and in the whole book is called A Matter of Identity, where Mr Thomson is unable to remember anything earlier than a couple of minutes ago, therefore he keeps making up stories about the people he meets, as if he knew them since always. This shows the importance of narrative in our lives and in our souls. The coherence of a story and of a narrative is also dictated by the society we live in. The moment Mr Thomson would be left alone, he would remain in silence, contemplating the plants and the static world around him, without feeling the need to make up stories. 
Each of us constructs a narrative about ourselves and the continuity and sense of this narrative is our own live. It is interesting to see how people react when they sense a discrepancy between reality and their own story of themselves. Some try to change reality, some will just change the narrative, and some will be stuck in a world that doesn't match reality. 

Biologically, we aren't that much different, but we are unique in our narratives. To be ourselves, we must be able to own our life stories and recollect our inner dramas. Our stories, which consist of our memories and our feelings and the way we continue to perceive the world, make up our soul. Mr Thompson doesn't know he is lost and he doesn't feel it. The only moment when he reconnects his feeling with the reality around is when he is only surrounded by nature.

82,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9630374-sandy,4,"Undoubtedly one of the best non-fictions I've ever come across. My nerves got all tangles up while reading this, it was that exiting. Even if it's 100% based on medical science it's written in such a way so anyone can understand what's going on.Every story is unique and was able to raise a brow. Very very Interesting. "
83,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,1,"Many many years ago while a lowly medical student, I read The Island of the Colour-blind and Cycad Island and came away a little underwhelmed. A grand desire to avoid any form of medical writing since has kept me away from the rest of his catalogue but with his recent death I decided to pick up one of his more famous titles.I struggled. I think part of the issue is the intervening 30 years since publication. He's firmly routed in a somewhat outmoded form of neurology and it shows (plus he seems to love Freud). Ideas and knowledge have moved on and it makes it hard to appreciate read with modern understanding. He's also clearly got some idols and almost every anecdote is linked to them in some way without him really explaining their significance (aside from a brief mention in the bibliography). His thoughts and interpretations comprise an odd mix of neurology, psychiatry and quasi-mysticism with a little sociology, philosophy and bullshitting thrown into the mix. There's definitely some ego at play here. I generally didn't accept his interpretations or like the style as a result and agree that his flowery repetitive prose can get a little muddling at times.I had no issue with the terminology though I'm not sure the lay public would necessarily find it that easy to pick up without a glossary or some Wikipedia work. I'm not entirely sure which audience he's writing for.If you throw in some outdated and insulting terminology, some terribly written reconstructed dialogue and a disjointed structure, it just didn't work for me.He was clearly an intelligent guy who deeply cared about his patients and put a huge amount of thought into the inner workings of the mind. He just isn't for me."
84,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105211-jacqui,4,"The first time I heard of Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, I was amused that anyone would do that--see his wife and think 'hat'? How silly! I figured when I read the book, I'd find this was a clever play on words. It didn't take long, though--less than a chapter--to find out that this was the world of one man and his psychosis. His brain couldn't collect the pieces picked up by his eyes and put them together sufficiently to determine what was his wife and what was the thing he'd put on his head to keep it dry.Sacks tells this story, and many other odd illnesses that our fellow humans suffer, with empathy and knowledge but no pity. I like that. He approaches these individuals with an interest in helping them recover a reality they've lost, not with any attitude that they are somehow lessor individuals because their bodies have stopped functioning like those around them. As a writer, I want to 1) include these fascinating oddities into my characters, and 2) share his sense of wonder about what is outside the norm with my readers.I came away from my time spent with Oliver Sacks and his patients wondering what I've missed when watching others, what goes on in their brains that I can't see and maybe haven't taken the time to understand. Is the human race more different than the same? Now, one book richer in my intellect, I'm quite sure that the slight difference in DNA between us and chimps and other life forms doesn't nearly tell the real story of life and its many forms. "
85,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24156068-christina---recipe-a-read,4,"So this is going to read as non-sequitur but stay with me here: I read World War Z earlier this year and the prologue is about the main character turning in a report to the CDC. The CDC is only concerned with hard numbers and facts, but our narrator is concerned with the ""human aspect"". The CDC wants him to eliminate the humanity from his report and give only hard science, while he feels the ""human aspect"" is what will heal the world after this zombie apocalypse. That is how I feel about Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales. We all know someone suffering from some type of mental abnormality. I, myself suffer from anxiety and have suffered from chronic panic attacks in my youth. However, in an attempt to make Psychology a ""hard science"" instead of a ""soft science"" which in the academic world is consistently looked down upon we tend to lose the humanity. Sacks' case studies are a humbling look at imperfection and how despite those imperfections, we are all still human. I will say that Sacks does stick to fairly dense, clinical and dry language throughout the book. However, I find my self consistently in awe that despite this, the humanity is the message that shines through. This is well worth anyone's time to read that has interest in anything psychology related."
86,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12831990-jason,2,"An interesting glimpse at some neurological case studies presented by the humanist Dr. Sachs.Sachs does a great job at introducing the reader to people with neurological ailments in these case studies, paying attention to the individuals and not just their disabilities. That being said I found myself wanting a bit more depth to the cases, more back story, more biography, it seemed so brief in many of the cases, but I do understand that was by design, introducing people to multiple interesting neurological occurrences in a succinct manner before moving on to the next. Sachs is famous for insisting in presenting cases in a narrative format and examining patients in a more organic way, assessing them scientifically, but also treating them as individuals and then making the cases accessible to laymen as well as his peers. You do find yourself wrangling with some neurological jargon, nothing that one shouldn't be able to break down or infer the meaning though. Sachs's love for a long sentence can be a bit cumbersome at times, utilizing the comma to it's breaking point before presenting the reader with a colon, many more commas, a statement that needs the aid of parentheses and maybe a dash or two just for funsies.

One of the case studies is one of those that all introductory psychology literature mentions about agnosia. The book feels very dated, with talk of “dullards”, “simpletons” and “savages”. (At least “savages” is always in quotation marks!). The science lies all in the past - it is incredible how close the 1980s, when this book was published, is to today, and yet, the science has advanced by leaps and bounds.Especially fascinating was the horrible case of the woman who lost proprioception.Interesting was the part about Tourette’s and how he described it as the first case where patients actively contributed to cures and solutions for their condition. The change from the autocratic doctor and today’s empowered patient (at least in theory) is palpable.His love for the patients that are different is clear, and how he feels that they are being needlessly neglected and should be valued for what they can contribute to society.... It is beautiful. I’m wondering what today’s autism activists think of the part in the book where he wrote about it.A definitive recommend for anyone interested in this early history of modern psychology."

The depictions of the various problems of Dr.Sacks's clients are amazing. You really begin to understand how precarious and delicate an instrument the brain is. I learned a lot from this book, though admittedly I know next to nothing about brain science. I found especially fascinating the discussions on the ""other senses"" of the brain that constantly monitor our bodies and identities.The book was ""front-loaded"" with all the interesting stories, and less interesting stories toward the back. Of course, that's just my opinion. There were points where I found myself drifting, especially when the author starts to wax philosophical. I guess I was just more interested in the client's stories and about what happened to them, rather than any thoughts on whether or not they had souls. "

There are but a few minor things that I would like to have seen tweaked.One, the inclusion of a glossary as I lost track of the meaning of some of the technical terms over the course of the read.Two, an updated edition with addenda explaining how these scenarios would be considered by modern medical science. My edition was published in the late eighties and it'd be interesting to see how understanding has developed over the last thirty years.Three, bearing in mind that this book was originally published in the eighties, I'd just like to remind people that the jargon has changed since then.

He talks about a patient suffering from autism, and says:-She had done appallingly in the testing— which, in a sense, was designed, like all neurological and psychological testing, not merely to uncover, to bring out deficits, but to decompose her into functions and deficits. She had come apart, horribly, in formal testing, but now she was mysteriously 'together' and composed. Why was she so decomposed before, how could she be so re-composed now? I had the strongest feeling of two wholly different modes of thought, or of organization, or of being. The first schematic— pattern-seeing, problem-solving— this is what had been tested, and where she had been found so defective, so disastrously wanting. But the tests had given no inkling of anything but the deficits, of anything, so to speak, beyond her deficits. They had given me no hint of her positive powers, her ability to perceive the real world— the world of nature, and perhaps of the imagination— as a coherent, intelligible, poetic whole: her ability to see this, think this, and (when she could) live this; they had given me no intimation of her inner world, which clearly was composed and coherent, and approached as something other than a set of problems or tasks.It's a very apt characterisation of people - and I enjoyed the focus on looking at people's strengths, or abilities, rather than their defects.

Firstly, it rises, for the first time, the public attention to some special subjects, as people with neurological disorders and their problems, their everyday burdens. Secondly, it shows the burdens of the families' members. Because of this book a general awareness is developed at the societal level.There are some stories about real people fighting everyday with symptoms like anxiety, lack in recognizing one's own body or somebody else's body, postures etc. Sacks opens our eyes to understand such persons, to care for them and to be able to help them.

Somehow, it had never made it to my “Currently Reading” list. The death of its author, Dr. Oliver Sacks, a neurologist, prompted me to actually start reading it.According to the author, there has been a serious dearth of good medical case writing in the 20th century. He refers back to the 19th century which was the heyday of such writing.What sort of writing are we talking about? The author wants to add back emotions and identities, instead of making cases impersonal.

The improbability of the title representing a real situation is perhaps part of the reason for this, but Sacks gives a glimpse into the worlds of people whose brains and nervous systems don't function normally, leading them to behave in unusual ways. He was one of the first scientists to write for a popular audience about what happens when parts of brains misbehave; when the circuitry of the nervous system has a short in it somewhere or just isn't wired the way most people are wired. His earlier books, like this, may seem simple to some recent reviewers coming across them for the first time, but at the time he wrote them they were revelatory. Still worth reading if you haven't already and you are interested in how humans work."

Written with a clinician's eye, but a poet's heart, I also love how he is able to show how these patients with all sorts of neurological deficits, disabilities, and divergences are able to adapt and even thrive despite their neurological damage. For the most part, they are able to find ""a new health, a new freedom"" through music, inner narratives, etc. They are able to achieve a ""Great Health,"" a peace and a paradoxical wellness THROUGH their illness."

On the very first page alone we get aphonia, aphemia, alexia with the only other ia mentioned that I knew being amnesia. I have to admit I was under the impression that this was a book for the layman but in truth is was not. Oliver Sacks talked to those that understood. A bit of a missed opportunity in my opinion. "

115,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"After having read An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales by the same author, I decided to pick this up. Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined! Is it visionary? Kind of.Kind of because, if with some cases he keep his promise of explaining the reasons why behind a particular condition or diagnosis (e.g. what is agnosia, and why it can lead to a man mistaking his wife for a hat!) most cases here are just pictures of people with weird beliefs and/ or behaviours without much of explaining. Here's a great catalogue of strange although touching people, but not very instructive when it comes to actually learning something about neuropsychology. Also, as much as I acknowledge his huge success and bestseller status, let's bear in mind that this was first published in 1985. It surely might have been ground-breaking back then, but what about now? For example, among his bizarre patients portrayed here feature a few autistic people, and, the way he describes them smacks of how it was back in the 70s and 80s -they are referred to as 'retarded', 'morons', 'simpleton', and not much is expected of them, to the point of Sacks himself being baffled by some of their actual abilities! Mind you, I am not denigrating the author. His view was the view of most of the medical community (let alone society at large) back then, and, to his credit, we see him challenging his own misconceptions and prejudices - a complete shift which will lead him to a whole new perception in one of his later book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (which will feature Temple Grandin and Stephen Wiltshire...). But, then, if he can be that unsure about autism alone, what about the rest? Interestingly enough, a whole chapter also about autism ('The Twins', featuring encounters which had inspired scenes in the movie 'Rain Man'...) was questioned too in Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind, a book by Daniel Tammet, himself one of these striking 'autist-savant'...To conclude, then, here's more a catalogue of a wide variety of people whose brains are wired differently than the 'norm' than proper lessons on the functioning of the human mind. It's not a bad thing -it's a deeply human and touching display. But, focusing on warm interpersonal relationships while neglecting the cold clinical side too often leads the author to speculate and make his own interpretations of how such people might feel and perceive the world around... Speculations which, at times, can be off the mark! It's interesting. It's engrossing. Yet, despite its jargon (both scientific and philosophical) it wasn't that instructive in terms of neuropsychology. Personally, I enjoyed it but didn't get much."
116,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12509961-eleni,5,"I was fascinated by this book of Oliver Sacks, since not only did I find it interesting in its core, ie in its description of cases of brain damage, but mostly because of Sacks' high expressive ability to bring these in front of the non- specialized audience in a figurative way. With his intelligence, insightfulness, compassion and a fine sense of humour, Sacks approaches his patients refusing to stick to stereotypes, attempting to see through the walls of isolation of the neurologically diseased. Is there a hope for his ""human islands well cut off from the main world"", well cut off from the whole to occasionally experience moments of inner peace and happiness? Through consecutive experimentation and observation Sacks sees in most of his subjects of study, his patients or his friends an ability to form a certain personal code of apprehension, a link between their selves and parts of the external world.  Finally I would like to refer to his lack of arrogance in honouring the pre-existing knowledge and the work of other specialists, as well as in presenting his interaction with renowned neurologists of his time in cases of puzzlement, bewilderment and perplexity. A really great mind."

Sacks stresses the importance of acknowledging a patients’ abilities as well as their defects, and speaks of illness and identity as narratives that we construct for ourselves and live out."

He talks about a patient suffering from autism, and says:-She had done appallingly in the testing— which, in a sense, was designed, like all neurological and psychological testing, not merely to uncover, to bring out deficits, but to decompose her into functions and deficits. She had come apart, horribly, in formal testing, but now she was mysteriously 'together' and composed. Why was she so decomposed before, how could she be so re-composed now? I had the strongest feeling of two wholly different modes of thought, or of organization, or of being. The first schematic— pattern-seeing, problem-solving— this is what had been tested, and where she had been found so defective, so disastrously wanting. But the tests had given no inkling of anything but the deficits, of anything, so to speak, beyond her deficits. They had given me no hint of her positive powers, her ability to perceive the real world— the world of nature, and perhaps of the imagination— as a coherent, intelligible, poetic whole: her ability to see this, think this, and (when she could) live this; they had given me no intimation of her inner world, which clearly was composed and coherent, and approached as something other than a set of problems or tasks.It's a very apt characterisation of people - and I enjoyed the focus on looking at people's strengths, or abilities, rather than their defects. The chapters are mostly short, and can be read alone, so it's an easily readable book. "

Firstly, it rises, for the first time, the public attention to some special subjects, as people with neurological disorders and their problems, their everyday burdens. Secondly, it shows the burdens of the families' members. Because of this book a general awareness is developed at the societal level.There are some stories about real people fighting everyday with symptoms like anxiety, lack in recognizing one's own body or somebody else's body, postures etc. Sacks opens our eyes to understand such persons, to care for them and to be able to help them.

145,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"After having read An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales by the same author, I decided to pick this up. Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined! Is it visionary? Kind of.Kind of because, if with some cases he keep his promise of explaining the reasons why behind a particular condition or diagnosis (e.g. what is agnosia, and why it can lead to a man mistaking his wife for a hat!) most cases here are just pictures of people with weird beliefs and/ or behaviours without much of explaining. Here's a great catalogue of strange although touching people, but not very instructive when it comes to actually learning something about neuropsychology. Also, as much as I acknowledge his huge success and bestseller status, let's bear in mind that this was first published in 1985. It surely might have been ground-breaking back then, but what about now? For example, among his bizarre patients portrayed here feature a few autistic people, and, the way he describes them smacks of how it was back in the 70s and 80s -they are referred to as 'retarded', 'morons', 'simpleton', and not much is expected of them, to the point of Sacks himself being baffled by some of their actual abilities! Mind you, I am not denigrating the author. His view was the view of most of the medical community (let alone society at large) back then, and, to his credit, we see him challenging his own misconceptions and prejudices - a complete shift which will lead him to a whole new perception in one of his later book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (which will feature Temple Grandin and Stephen Wiltshire...). But, then, if he can be that unsure about autism alone, what about the rest? Interestingly enough, a whole chapter also about autism ('The Twins', featuring encounters which had inspired scenes in the movie 'Rain Man'...) was questioned too in Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind, a book by Daniel Tammet, himself one of these striking 'autist-savant'...To conclude, then, here's more a catalogue of a wide variety of people whose brains are wired differently than the 'norm' than proper lessons on the functioning of the human mind. It's not a bad thing -it's a deeply human and touching display. But, focusing on warm interpersonal relationships while neglecting the cold clinical side too often leads the author to speculate and make his own interpretations of how such people might feel and perceive the world around... Speculations which, at times, can be off the mark! It's interesting. It's engrossing. Yet, despite its jargon (both scientific and philosophical) it wasn't that instructive in terms of neuropsychology. Personally, I enjoyed it but didn't get much."

With his intelligence, insightfulness, compassion and a fine sense of humour, Sacks approaches his patients refusing to stick to stereotypes, attempting to see through the walls of isolation of the neurologically diseased. Is there a hope for his ""human islands well cut off from the main world"", well cut off from the whole to occasionally experience moments of inner peace and happiness? Through consecutive experimentation and observation Sacks sees in most of his subjects of study, his patients or his friends an ability to form a certain personal code of apprehension, a link between their selves and parts of the external world.  Finally I would like to refer to his lack of arrogance in honouring the pre-existing knowledge and the work of other specialists, as well as in presenting his interaction with renowned neurologists of his time in cases of puzzlement, bewilderment and perplexity. A really great mind."

He talks about a patient suffering from autism, and says:-She had done appallingly in the testing— which, in a sense, was designed, like all neurological and psychological testing, not merely to uncover, to bring out deficits, but to decompose her into functions and deficits. She had come apart, horribly, in formal testing, but now she was mysteriously 'together' and composed. Why was she so decomposed before, how could she be so re-composed now? I had the strongest feeling of two wholly different modes of thought, or of organization, or of being. The first schematic— pattern-seeing, problem-solving— this is what had been tested, and where she had been found so defective, so disastrously wanting. But the tests had given no inkling of anything but the deficits, of anything, so to speak, beyond her deficits. They had given me no hint of her positive powers, her ability to perceive the real world— the world of nature, and perhaps of the imagination— as a coherent, intelligible, poetic whole: her ability to see this, think this, and (when she could) live this; they had given me no intimation of her inner world, which clearly was composed and coherent, and approached as something other than a set of problems or tasks.It's a very apt characterisation of people - and I enjoyed the focus on looking at people's strengths, or abilities, rather than their defects. The chapters are mostly short, and can be read alone, so it's an easily readable book. "

Firstly, it rises, for the first time, the public attention to some special subjects, as people with neurological disorders and their problems, their everyday burdens. Secondly, it shows the burdens of the families' members. Because of this book a general awareness is developed at the societal level.There are some stories about real people fighting everyday with symptoms like anxiety, lack in recognizing one's own body or somebody else's body, postures etc. Sacks opens our eyes to understand such persons, to care for them and to be able to help them.

159,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,2,"IntroductionI have been looking forward to read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat‘ for more than a year. Somehow, it had never made it to my “Currently Reading” list. The death of its author, Dr. Oliver Sacks, a neurologist, prompted me to actually start reading it.According to the author, there has been a serious dearth of good medical case writing in the 20th century. He refers back to the 19th century which was the heyday of such writing.What sort of writing are we talking about? The author wants to add back emotions and identities, instead of making cases impersonal. People who have read Sherlock Holmes or other literature (fiction/non-fiction) from the 19th century will be able to recognise such writing – for e.g. – referring to a patient as Johnny G or Dr P.This book deals with some neurological cases with emphasis on right brain defects and deficiencies. There are 24 different topics that the book covers. These include some made popular by movies like Kursakoff’s syndrome in Memento or Autistic Savants in House of Cards. These topics have fanciful names like “The Lost Mariner” and “The Disembodied Lady” etc.RecommendationI have to confess – much as I wanted to like this book, I found it a chore to read. In the end, I stopped midway due to the sheer drudgery involved in going through the indecipherable prose as well as the incomprehensible medical jargon. Either of the two would have been fine on its own; but their combination makes for dull reading.The author cannot seem to make up his mind – is this a book that talks about these cases from an entertainment perspective or is this book a medical text. If the former, then it fails at holding the reader’s imagination and does the cardinal mistake of interjecting a lot of serious medical terms. If the latter, then the book fails at presenting the facts, the diagnosis and the conclusion."
160,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I'd picked this book up thinking it would be a light, undemanding read - a collection of medical oddities and bizarre tales. Some of the tales do fall into this category: The Disembodied Lady (about a woman who suffers a loss of proprioception), Hands (about a woman who doesn't regard her hands as being part of herself) and Phantoms (about phantom limbs). But other tales were more a reflection on the human condition. In the title tale, Sacks muses over severe visual agnosia and its destruction of Mr P's sense of the concrete, how he perceives and interprets the world. In The Lost Mariner, Sacks discusses whether a patient with severe amnesia - where the patient can no longer recall any event beyond 5 minutes - can really be described as living. For what is a life with no memories of experiences and relationships?Some of the tales discussed how a patient's neurological condition was seen (by the patient) as adding to, rather than detracting from, his sense of self and life. Witty Ticcy Ray - about a Tourette sufferer - in many ways reminded me of Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind on her experience with bipolar disorder. How there were many lows, but there were exquisite moments on the upswing, when the creativity, energy and sense of clarity she had was addictive and exhilerating. The section on ""The World of the Simple"" was probably the most intriguing for me, with its tales of Rebecca (a so-called simpleton who had an appreciation of the concrete and narrative in poetry and music), the Autist Artist, the Twins and A Walking Grove (on a patient with retardation but an amazing musical memory)"
161,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50408211-shawn-mooney-shawn-the-book-maniac,5,"My love for Oliver Sacks had been based solely on what I'd heard him talk about, and his inquisitive, twinkle-eyed persona, in many a media interview over the years. That, and what little memory I have of the Robin Williams film. I'd never actually read him. I adore him even more, now. This, his fourth and one of his most well-known books, was almost completely a delight. My only small quibble was with the introduction and some of the postscripts where his prose lapsed into medical jargon and lost me. Otherwise, Sacks writes about his patients with lush perception and compassion. The highest compliment I can pay is that I often forgot I was reading non-fiction: he brings his patients alive on the page with a novelist's flair.Whether it's the man who mistook his wife for a hat (this chapter is doubly poignant with the knowledge that Sacks himself was much later diagnosed with face blindness), the man with Tourette's, the nearly 90-year-old lady with the suddenly explosive libido, the mentally retarded twins who couldn't say what two plus two equaled but could tell you within a split second exactly how many marbles fell onto the floor after a jar full of them tipped over, Sacks imbues his patients with humanity and dignity. What's more, in many cases, he agrees with them when they say they don't wish for a complete cure because their neurological problems actually enrich their lives. Sometimes, Sacks would halve the meds to enable his patients to find the right balance.That becomes a lovely metaphor for living any kind of life with zany dignity."
162,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska,3,"I read these case histories over the course of several weeks, interspersing with my other reading. I find this works best for me for this type of book as well as for short stories. I suppose it's true with anything of this sort that some of the chapters were fascinating while others were downright dull. I did not especially care for the title story, but perhaps that's just because it was first and I had not yet settled into the presentations. This collection was first published in 1985, but the essays were first published earlier - some of them as much as 20 years earlier. Each has a postscript. Sometimes the postscript is a follow-up of the patient, others discuss essays by other authors about similar subjects.Sometime in the past couple of years, I was reminded that our body replaces hundreds of thousands of cells daily. Sometimes it makes mistakes. Reading this collection, I learned about some of the ways it can make mistakes. I paused to consider how well the body does this cell replacing and that it doesn't go wrong more often. At least I 
think
 it hasn't gotten it wrong in my case. In spite of its being dated and I'm sure much research would bring some of Sacks' conclusions current, this was well worth the time. If I had not been reading for a challenge, however, I might have been willing to skim or skip some of the chapters. Because of that, I cannot give this more than 3 stars."

Sacks makes a good case that a mind-set which is entirely abstract (the most fascinating titular patient) is even more alien than one which grasps only concretes, like the autistic. He also critiques the “working vs. deficient” model of neurology, depicting phenomena and mental breakthroughs that can only come into being outside of the laboratory and traditional testing.

They had given me no hint of her positive powers, her ability to perceive the real world— the world of nature, and perhaps of the imagination— as a coherent, intelligible, poetic whole: her ability to see this, think this, and (when she could) live this; they had given me no intimation of her inner world, which clearly was composed and coherent, and approached as something other than a set of problems or tasks.It's a very apt characterisation of people - and I enjoyed the focus on looking at people's strengths, or abilities, rather than their defects.

Firstly, it rises, for the first time, the public attention to some special subjects, as people with neurological disorders and their problems, their everyday burdens. Secondly, it shows the burdens of the families' members. Because of this book a general awareness is developed at the societal level.There are some stories about real people fighting everyday with symptoms like anxiety, lack in recognizing one's own body or somebody else's body, postures etc. Sacks opens our eyes to understand such persons, to care for them and to be able to help them.

He is fascinated by his patients and their quirks and it’s infectious .It’s Medical storytelling at its best , scientific stories are made accessible with witty patients humanized by an empathic dr leaving you even more in awe of the human brain with its -not yet fully understood- potential and resilience."
189,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,2,"IntroductionI have been looking forward to read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat‘ for more than a year. Somehow, it had never made it to my “Currently Reading” list. The death of its author, Dr. Oliver Sacks, a neurologist, prompted me to actually start reading it.According to the author, there has been a serious dearth of good medical case writing in the 20th century. He refers back to the 19th century which was the heyday of such writing.What sort of writing are we talking about? The author wants to add back emotions and identities, instead of making cases impersonal. People who have read Sherlock Holmes or other literature (fiction/non-fiction) from the 19th century will be able to recognise such writing – for e.g. – referring to a patient as Johnny G or Dr P.This book deals with some neurological cases with emphasis on right brain defects and deficiencies. There are 24 different topics that the book covers. These include some made popular by movies like Kursakoff’s syndrome in Memento or Autistic Savants in House of Cards. These topics have fanciful names like “The Lost Mariner” and “The Disembodied Lady” etc.RecommendationI have to confess – much as I wanted to like this book, I found it a chore to read. In the end, I stopped midway due to the sheer drudgery involved in going through the indecipherable prose as well as the incomprehensible medical jargon. Either of the two would have been fine on its own; but their combination makes for dull reading.The author cannot seem to make up his mind – is this a book that talks about these cases from an entertainment perspective or is this book a medical text. If the former, then it fails at holding the reader’s imagination and does the cardinal mistake of interjecting a lot of serious medical terms. If the latter, then the book fails at presenting the facts, the diagnosis and the conclusion."
190,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I'd picked this book up thinking it would be a light, undemanding read - a collection of medical oddities and bizarre tales. Some of the tales do fall into this category: The Disembodied Lady (about a woman who suffers a loss of proprioception), Hands (about a woman who doesn't regard her hands as being part of herself) and Phantoms (about phantom limbs). But other tales were more a reflection on the human condition. In the title tale, Sacks muses over severe visual agnosia and its destruction of Mr P's sense of the concrete, how he perceives and interprets the world. In The Lost Mariner, Sacks discusses whether a patient with severe amnesia - where the patient can no longer recall any event beyond 5 minutes - can really be described as living. For what is a life with no memories of experiences and relationships?Some of the tales discussed how a patient's neurological condition was seen (by the patient) as adding to, rather than detracting from, his sense of self and life. Witty Ticcy Ray - about a Tourette sufferer - in many ways reminded me of Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind on her experience with bipolar disorder. How there were many lows, but there were exquisite moments on the upswing, when the creativity, energy and sense of clarity she had was addictive and exhilerating. The section on ""The World of the Simple"" was probably the most intriguing for me, with its tales of Rebecca (a so-called simpleton who had an appreciation of the concrete and narrative in poetry and music), the Autist Artist, the Twins and A Walking Grove (on a patient with retardation but an amazing musical memory)"
191,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50408211-shawn-mooney-shawn-the-book-maniac,5,"My love for Oliver Sacks had been based solely on what I'd heard him talk about, and his inquisitive, twinkle-eyed persona, in many a media interview over the years. That, and what little memory I have of the Robin Williams film. I'd never actually read him. I adore him even more, now. This, his fourth and one of his most well-known books, was almost completely a delight. My only small quibble was with the introduction and some of the postscripts where his prose lapsed into medical jargon and lost me. Otherwise, Sacks writes about his patients with lush perception and compassion. The highest compliment I can pay is that I often forgot I was reading non-fiction: he brings his patients alive on the page with a novelist's flair.Whether it's the man who mistook his wife for a hat (this chapter is doubly poignant with the knowledge that Sacks himself was much later diagnosed with face blindness), the man with Tourette's, the nearly 90-year-old lady with the suddenly explosive libido, the mentally retarded twins who couldn't say what two plus two equaled but could tell you within a split second exactly how many marbles fell onto the floor after a jar full of them tipped over, Sacks imbues his patients with humanity and dignity. What's more, in many cases, he agrees with them when they say they don't wish for a complete cure because their neurological problems actually enrich their lives. Sometimes, Sacks would halve the meds to enable his patients to find the right balance.That becomes a lovely metaphor for living any kind of life with zany dignity."
192,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska,3,"I read these case histories over the course of several weeks, interspersing with my other reading. I find this works best for me for this type of book as well as for short stories. I suppose it's true with anything of this sort that some of the chapters were fascinating while others were downright dull. I did not especially care for the title story, but perhaps that's just because it was first and I had not yet settled into the presentations. This collection was first published in 1985, but the essays were first published earlier - some of them as much as 20 years earlier. Each has a postscript. Sometimes the postscript is a follow-up of the patient, others discuss essays by other authors about similar subjects.Sometime in the past couple of years, I was reminded that our body replaces hundreds of thousands of cells daily. Sometimes it makes mistakes. Reading this collection, I learned about some of the ways it can make mistakes. I paused to consider how well the body does this cell replacing and that it doesn't go wrong more often. At least I 
think
 it hasn't gotten it wrong in my case. In spite of its being dated and I'm sure much research would bring some of Sacks' conclusions current, this was well worth the time. If I had not been reading for a challenge, however, I might have been willing to skim or skip some of the chapters. Because of that, I cannot give this more than 3 stars."
193,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"Twenty-four case studies, grouped under four rubrics: Losses (amnesia, total loss of proprioception, etc); Excesses (Tourette’s, a Korsakov’s patient in a state of constant, frantic confabulation as a defense against amnesia, etc); Transports (cases of involuntary reminiscence and heightened senses); and The World of the Simple (autistic and retarded patients, mostly with eidetic powers).Though it’s much more clinical in style than An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales, this is still an interesting collection. Sacks makes a good case that a mind-set which is entirely abstract (the most fascinating titular patient) is even more alien than one which grasps only concretes, like the autistic. He also critiques the “working vs. deficient” model of neurology, depicting phenomena and mental breakthroughs that can only come into being outside of the laboratory and traditional testing. Aside from his arguments, as a collection of anecdotes, this book is enthralling and terrifying, an amazing look into just a few of the wondrous, bizarre ways mind can malfunction. "
194,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13628006-cristina-costache,5,"I will begin with a quote: “If a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an eye; but if he has lost a self—himself—he cannot know it, because he is no longer there to know it.” - and it was hard to choose only one. This book was a delight, a painful and heavy delight. It left me naked in front of my own self and made me question myself and the way I see other people (as if I wan't doing that already). My rotation on stroke helped me understand it even more, helped me immerse myself even more in its stories. I wish I read it long ago, can't believe I spent 7 years in medicine without reading it. A reflection of the depths that my mind reaches every day, it spoke to me with every phrase, more than every other book related to medicine/the life of a doctor has done so far. I have found a new favourite book."
195,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"This is amongst the best known of Sacks' works. The improbability of the title representing a real situation is perhaps part of the reason for this, but Sacks gives a glimpse into the worlds of people whose brains and nervous systems don't function normally, leading them to behave in unusual ways. He was one of the first scientists to write for a popular audience about what happens when parts of brains misbehave; when the circuitry of the nervous system has a short in it somewhere or just isn't wired the way most people are wired. His earlier books, like this, may seem simple to some recent reviewers coming across them for the first time, but at the time he wrote them they were revelatory. Still worth reading if you haven't already and you are interested in how humans work."
196,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"I love how Sacks, through his small clinical vignettes, exposes the complex, narrative powers of the brain. Written with a clinician's eye, but a poet's heart, I also love how he is able to show how these patients with all sorts of neurological deficits, disabilities, and divergences are able to adapt and even thrive despite their neurological damage. For the most part, they are able to find ""a new health, a new freedom"" through music, inner narratives, etc. They are able to achieve a ""Great Health,"" a peace and a paradoxical wellness THROUGH their illness."

There is no doubt that as someone who has never really thought about Neurology prior to reading this book it could be an interesting subject if some of the the language was not so dense. On the very first page alone we get aphonia, aphemia, alexia with the only other ia mentioned that I knew being amnesia. I have to admit I was under the impression that this was a book for the layman but in truth is was not. Oliver Sacks talked to those that understood. A bit of a missed opportunity in my opinion. "

But I still loved the journey the author presents in each case.Loved it.Haven't read ""On the Move"" yet and wanted to back when it came out. Maybe I'll go for that one next."

Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined!

But other tales were more a reflection on the human condition. In the title tale, Sacks muses over severe visual agnosia and its destruction of Mr P's sense of the concrete, how he perceives and interprets the world. In The Lost Mariner, Sacks discusses whether a patient with severe amnesia - where the patient can no longer recall any event beyond 5 minutes - can really be described as living. For what is a life with no memories of experiences and relationships?Some of the tales discussed how a patient's neurological condition was seen (by the patient) as adding to, rather than detracting from, his sense of self and life. Witty Ticcy Ray - about a Tourette sufferer - in many ways reminded me of Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind on her experience with bipolar disorder. How there were many lows, but there were exquisite moments on the upswing, when the creativity, energy and sense of clarity she had was addictive and exhilerating. The section on ""The World of the Simple"" was probably the most intriguing for me, with its tales of Rebecca (a so-called simpleton who had an appreciation of the concrete and narrative in poetry and music), the Autist Artist, the Twins and A Walking Grove (on a patient with retardation but an amazing musical memory)"
221,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50408211-shawn-mooney-shawn-the-book-maniac,5,"My love for Oliver Sacks had been based solely on what I'd heard him talk about, and his inquisitive, twinkle-eyed persona, in many a media interview over the years. That, and what little memory I have of the Robin Williams film. I'd never actually read him. I adore him even more, now. This, his fourth and one of his most well-known books, was almost completely a delight. My only small quibble was with the introduction and some of the postscripts where his prose lapsed into medical jargon and lost me. Otherwise, Sacks writes about his patients with lush perception and compassion. The highest compliment I can pay is that I often forgot I was reading non-fiction: he brings his patients alive on the page with a novelist's flair.Whether it's the man who mistook his wife for a hat (this chapter is doubly poignant with the knowledge that Sacks himself was much later diagnosed with face blindness), the man with Tourette's, the nearly 90-year-old lady with the suddenly explosive libido, the mentally retarded twins who couldn't say what two plus two equaled but could tell you within a split second exactly how many marbles fell onto the floor after a jar full of them tipped over, Sacks imbues his patients with humanity and dignity. What's more, in many cases, he agrees with them when they say they don't wish for a complete cure because their neurological problems actually enrich their lives. Sometimes, Sacks would halve the meds to enable his patients to find the right balance.That becomes a lovely metaphor for living any kind of life with zany dignity."
222,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska,3,"I read these case histories over the course of several weeks, interspersing with my other reading. I find this works best for me for this type of book as well as for short stories. I suppose it's true with anything of this sort that some of the chapters were fascinating while others were downright dull. I did not especially care for the title story, but perhaps that's just because it was first and I had not yet settled into the presentations. This collection was first published in 1985, but the essays were first published earlier - some of them as much as 20 years earlier. Each has a postscript. Sometimes the postscript is a follow-up of the patient, others discuss essays by other authors about similar subjects.Sometime in the past couple of years, I was reminded that our body replaces hundreds of thousands of cells daily. Sometimes it makes mistakes. Reading this collection, I learned about some of the ways it can make mistakes. I paused to consider how well the body does this cell replacing and that it doesn't go wrong more often. At least I 
think
 it hasn't gotten it wrong in my case. In spite of its being dated and I'm sure much research would bring some of Sacks' conclusions current, this was well worth the time. If I had not been reading for a challenge, however, I might have been willing to skim or skip some of the chapters. Because of that, I cannot give this more than 3 stars."
223,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"Twenty-four case studies, grouped under four rubrics: Losses (amnesia, total loss of proprioception, etc); Excesses (Tourette’s, a Korsakov’s patient in a state of constant, frantic confabulation as a defense against amnesia, etc); Transports (cases of involuntary reminiscence and heightened senses); and The World of the Simple (autistic and retarded patients, mostly with eidetic powers).Though it’s much more clinical in style than An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales, this is still an interesting collection. Sacks makes a good case that a mind-set which is entirely abstract (the most fascinating titular patient) is even more alien than one which grasps only concretes, like the autistic. He also critiques the “working vs. deficient” model of neurology, depicting phenomena and mental breakthroughs that can only come into being outside of the laboratory and traditional testing. Aside from his arguments, as a collection of anecdotes, this book is enthralling and terrifying, an amazing look into just a few of the wondrous, bizarre ways mind can malfunction. "

This book was a delight, a painful and heavy delight. It left me naked in front of my own self and made me question myself and the way I see other people (as if I wan't doing that already). My rotation on stroke helped me understand it even more, helped me immerse myself even more in its stories. I wish I read it long ago, can't believe I spent 7 years in medicine without reading it. A reflection of the depths that my mind reaches every day, it spoke to me with every phrase, more than every other book related to medicine/the life of a doctor has done so far.

The improbability of the title representing a real situation is perhaps part of the reason for this, but Sacks gives a glimpse into the worlds of people whose brains and nervous systems don't function normally, leading them to behave in unusual ways. He was one of the first scientists to write for a popular audience about what happens when parts of brains misbehave; when the circuitry of the nervous system has a short in it somewhere or just isn't wired the way most people are wired. His earlier books, like this, may seem simple to some recent reviewers coming across them for the first time, but at the time he wrote them they were revelatory. Still worth reading if you haven't already and you are interested in how humans work."

Written with a clinician's eye, but a poet's heart, I also love how he is able to show how these patients with all sorts of neurological deficits, disabilities, and divergences are able to adapt and even thrive despite their neurological damage. For the most part, they are able to find ""a new health, a new freedom"" through music, inner narratives, etc. They are able to achieve a ""Great Health,"" a peace and a paradoxical wellness THROUGH their illness."

235,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"After having read An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales by the same author, I decided to pick this up. Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined! Is it visionary? Kind of.Kind of because, if with some cases he keep his promise of explaining the reasons why behind a particular condition or diagnosis (e.g. what is agnosia, and why it can lead to a man mistaking his wife for a hat!) most cases here are just pictures of people with weird beliefs and/ or behaviours without much of explaining. Here's a great catalogue of strange although touching people, but not very instructive when it comes to actually learning something about neuropsychology. Also, as much as I acknowledge his huge success and bestseller status, let's bear in mind that this was first published in 1985. It surely might have been ground-breaking back then, but what about now? For example, among his bizarre patients portrayed here feature a few autistic people, and, the way he describes them smacks of how it was back in the 70s and 80s -they are referred to as 'retarded', 'morons', 'simpleton', and not much is expected of them, to the point of Sacks himself being baffled by some of their actual abilities! Mind you, I am not denigrating the author. His view was the view of most of the medical community (let alone society at large) back then, and, to his credit, we see him challenging his own misconceptions and prejudices - a complete shift which will lead him to a whole new perception in one of his later book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (which will feature Temple Grandin and Stephen Wiltshire...). But, then, if he can be that unsure about autism alone, what about the rest? Interestingly enough, a whole chapter also about autism ('The Twins', featuring encounters which had inspired scenes in the movie 'Rain Man'...) was questioned too in Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind, a book by Daniel Tammet, himself one of these striking 'autist-savant'...To conclude, then, here's more a catalogue of a wide variety of people whose brains are wired differently than the 'norm' than proper lessons on the functioning of the human mind. It's not a bad thing -it's a deeply human and touching display. But, focusing on warm interpersonal relationships while neglecting the cold clinical side too often leads the author to speculate and make his own interpretations of how such people might feel and perceive the world around... Speculations which, at times, can be off the mark! It's interesting. It's engrossing. Yet, despite its jargon (both scientific and philosophical) it wasn't that instructive in terms of neuropsychology. Personally, I enjoyed it but didn't get much."
236,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12509961-eleni,5,"I was fascinated by this book of Oliver Sacks, since not only did I find it interesting in its core, ie in its description of cases of brain damage, but mostly because of Sacks' high expressive ability to bring these in front of the non- specialized audience in a figurative way. With his intelligence, insightfulness, compassion and a fine sense of humour, Sacks approaches his patients refusing to stick to stereotypes, attempting to see through the walls of isolation of the neurologically diseased. Is there a hope for his ""human islands well cut off from the main world"", well cut off from the whole to occasionally experience moments of inner peace and happiness? Through consecutive experimentation and observation Sacks sees in most of his subjects of study, his patients or his friends an ability to form a certain personal code of apprehension, a link between their selves and parts of the external world.  Finally I would like to refer to his lack of arrogance in honouring the pre-existing knowledge and the work of other specialists, as well as in presenting his interaction with renowned neurologists of his time in cases of puzzlement, bewilderment and perplexity. A really great mind."

Sacks stresses the importance of acknowledging a patients’ abilities as well as their defects, and speaks of illness and identity as narratives that we construct for ourselves and live out."

265,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"After having read An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales by the same author, I decided to pick this up. Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined! Is it visionary? Kind of.Kind of because, if with some cases he keep his promise of explaining the reasons why behind a particular condition or diagnosis (e.g. what is agnosia, and why it can lead to a man mistaking his wife for a hat!) most cases here are just pictures of people with weird beliefs and/ or behaviours without much of explaining. Here's a great catalogue of strange although touching people, but not very instructive when it comes to actually learning something about neuropsychology. Also, as much as I acknowledge his huge success and bestseller status, let's bear in mind that this was first published in 1985. It surely might have been ground-breaking back then, but what about now? For example, among his bizarre patients portrayed here feature a few autistic people, and, the way he describes them smacks of how it was back in the 70s and 80s -they are referred to as 'retarded', 'morons', 'simpleton', and not much is expected of them, to the point of Sacks himself being baffled by some of their actual abilities! Mind you, I am not denigrating the author. His view was the view of most of the medical community (let alone society at large) back then, and, to his credit, we see him challenging his own misconceptions and prejudices - a complete shift which will lead him to a whole new perception in one of his later book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (which will feature Temple Grandin and Stephen Wiltshire...). But, then, if he can be that unsure about autism alone, what about the rest? Interestingly enough, a whole chapter also about autism ('The Twins', featuring encounters which had inspired scenes in the movie 'Rain Man'...) was questioned too in Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind, a book by Daniel Tammet, himself one of these striking 'autist-savant'...To conclude, then, here's more a catalogue of a wide variety of people whose brains are wired differently than the 'norm' than proper lessons on the functioning of the human mind. It's not a bad thing -it's a deeply human and touching display. But, focusing on warm interpersonal relationships while neglecting the cold clinical side too often leads the author to speculate and make his own interpretations of how such people might feel and perceive the world around... Speculations which, at times, can be off the mark! It's interesting. It's engrossing. Yet, despite its jargon (both scientific and philosophical) it wasn't that instructive in terms of neuropsychology. Personally, I enjoyed it but didn't get much."
266,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12509961-eleni,5,"I was fascinated by this book of Oliver Sacks, since not only did I find it interesting in its core, ie in its description of cases of brain damage, but mostly because of Sacks' high expressive ability to bring these in front of the non- specialized audience in a figurative way. With his intelligence, insightfulness, compassion and a fine sense of humour, Sacks approaches his patients refusing to stick to stereotypes, attempting to see through the walls of isolation of the neurologically diseased. Is there a hope for his ""human islands well cut off from the main world"", well cut off from the whole to occasionally experience moments of inner peace and happiness? Through consecutive experimentation and observation Sacks sees in most of his subjects of study, his patients or his friends an ability to form a certain personal code of apprehension, a link between their selves and parts of the external world.  Finally I would like to refer to his lack of arrogance in honouring the pre-existing knowledge and the work of other specialists, as well as in presenting his interaction with renowned neurologists of his time in cases of puzzlement, bewilderment and perplexity. A really great mind."

He talks about a patient suffering from autism, and says:-She had done appallingly in the testing— which, in a sense, was designed, like all neurological and psychological testing, not merely to uncover, to bring out deficits, but to decompose her into functions and deficits. She had come apart, horribly, in formal testing, but now she was mysteriously 'together' and composed. Why was she so decomposed before, how could she be so re-composed now? I had the strongest feeling of two wholly different modes of thought, or of organization, or of being. The first schematic— pattern-seeing, problem-solving— this is what had been tested, and where she had been found so defective, so disastrously wanting. But the tests had given no inkling of anything but the deficits, of anything, so to speak, beyond her deficits. They had given me no hint of her positive powers, her ability to perceive the real world— the world of nature, and perhaps of the imagination— as a coherent, intelligible, poetic whole: her ability to see this, think this, and (when she could) live this; they had given me no intimation of her inner world, which clearly was composed and coherent, and approached as something other than a set of problems or tasks.It's a very apt characterisation of people - and I enjoyed the focus on looking at people's strengths, or abilities, rather than their defects. The chapters are mostly short, and can be read alone, so it's an easily readable book. "

Secondly, it shows the burdens of the families' members. Because of this book a general awareness is developed at the societal level.There are some stories about real people fighting everyday with symptoms like anxiety, lack in recognizing one's own body or somebody else's body, postures etc. Sacks opens our eyes to understand such persons, to care for them and to be able to help them.

Somehow, it had never made it to my “Currently Reading” list. The death of its author, Dr. Oliver Sacks, a neurologist, prompted me to actually start reading it.According to the author, there has been a serious dearth of good medical case writing in the 20th century. He refers back to the 19th century which was the heyday of such writing.What sort of writing are we talking about? The author wants to add back emotions and identities, instead of making cases impersonal. People who have read Sherlock Holmes or other literature (fiction/non-fiction) from the 19th century will be able to recognise such writing – for e.g. – referring to a patient as Johnny G or Dr P.This book deals with some neurological cases with emphasis on right brain defects and deficiencies. There are 24 different topics that the book covers. These include some made popular by movies like Kursakoff’s syndrome in Memento or Autistic Savants in House of Cards. These topics have fanciful names like “The Lost Mariner” and “The Disembodied Lady” etc.RecommendationI have to confess – much as I wanted to like this book, I found it a chore to read. In the end, I stopped midway due to the sheer drudgery involved in going through the indecipherable prose as well as the incomprehensible medical jargon. Either of the two would have been fine on its own; but their combination makes for dull reading.The author cannot seem to make up his mind – is this a book that talks about these cases from an entertainment perspective or is this book a medical text. If the former, then it fails at holding the reader’s imagination and does the cardinal mistake of interjecting a lot of serious medical terms. If the latter, then the book fails at presenting the facts, the diagnosis and the conclusion."
280,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,3,"I'd picked this book up thinking it would be a light, undemanding read - a collection of medical oddities and bizarre tales. Some of the tales do fall into this category: The Disembodied Lady (about a woman who suffers a loss of proprioception), Hands (about a woman who doesn't regard her hands as being part of herself) and Phantoms (about phantom limbs). But other tales were more a reflection on the human condition. In the title tale, Sacks muses over severe visual agnosia and its destruction of Mr P's sense of the concrete, how he perceives and interprets the world. In The Lost Mariner, Sacks discusses whether a patient with severe amnesia - where the patient can no longer recall any event beyond 5 minutes - can really be described as living. For what is a life with no memories of experiences and relationships?Some of the tales discussed how a patient's neurological condition was seen (by the patient) as adding to, rather than detracting from, his sense of self and life. Witty Ticcy Ray - about a Tourette sufferer - in many ways reminded me of Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind on her experience with bipolar disorder. How there were many lows, but there were exquisite moments on the upswing, when the creativity, energy and sense of clarity she had was addictive and exhilerating. The section on ""The World of the Simple"" was probably the most intriguing for me, with its tales of Rebecca (a so-called simpleton who had an appreciation of the concrete and narrative in poetry and music), the Autist Artist, the Twins and A Walking Grove (on a patient with retardation but an amazing musical memory)"

There is no doubt that as someone who has never really thought about Neurology prior to reading this book it could be an interesting subject if some of the the language was not so dense. On the very first page alone we get aphonia, aphemia, alexia with the only other ia mentioned that I knew being amnesia. I have to admit I was under the impression that this was a book for the layman but in truth is was not. Oliver Sacks talked to those that understood. A bit of a missed opportunity in my opinion. "
288,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79324881-christopher-sullivan,5,"I loved it. I've always been interested in brain science nonfiction stuff, so this was worth the re-read. I really loved the conversational tone Sacks uses.The stories should be accessible to everyone moderately interested in the topic of the chapter at hand, though since I read this decades after it was written, I already knew some of what Sacks was getting at before the 'big reveals'. But I still loved the journey the author presents in each case.Loved it.Haven't read ""On the Move"" yet and wanted to back when it came out. Maybe I'll go for that one next."

These are only because I am not perfectly capable to understand all the details of this book, which is very well written and great as a breath of fresh air among the dramatic stories which are usually my favorites. Also, the book is a good reminder of how our brain works and more subtle... why we should't judge based on covers. People can be much more than their outer image."
290,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7251858-vladimir,2,"I feel kind of bad because of the rating I gave. To justify it, it might have been wrong timing, or the wrong format (I listened to it), or well, I just didn't get into it well enough. But, anyhow, I didn't find as engaging as I though it would be."
291,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890368-sevdah,0,"It's such a joy to read a book by someone so endlessly curious. We all know how good this book is even before reading it, so my expectations were high enough, but it still managed to surprise and fascinate me."

293,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299266-lenore,4,Never has Dr Sacks failed to celebrate empathy and compassion in his writings. A truly rewarding read.

295,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"After having read An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales by the same author, I decided to pick this up. Will it be as good? Well, it's supposed to follow the same recipe: bring in a patient suffering from a weird case or condition, dissect it clinically so as to illustrate how the human brain works, and, leave it to the reader to ponder upon how such cases, as striking and bizarre as they can be moving and touching, can lead to question what constitutes a 'self', or even being human. Sacks, there is no denying that, is a brilliant scientist. He not only takes upon the tradition of describing individuals in all their personal stories to better serve clinical classifications (an approach which was common in the 19th century, especially in psychiatry, but had sadly gotten lost over time) but, also, manages here to display a wide range of cases all illustrating neurodiversity, more than thirty years before the word 'neurodiversity' itself was even coined! Is it visionary? Kind of.Kind of because, if with some cases he keep his promise of explaining the reasons why behind a particular condition or diagnosis (e.g. what is agnosia, and why it can lead to a man mistaking his wife for a hat!) most cases here are just pictures of people with weird beliefs and/ or behaviours without much of explaining. Here's a great catalogue of strange although touching people, but not very instructive when it comes to actually learning something about neuropsychology. Also, as much as I acknowledge his huge success and bestseller status, let's bear in mind that this was first published in 1985. It surely might have been ground-breaking back then, but what about now? For example, among his bizarre patients portrayed here feature a few autistic people, and, the way he describes them smacks of how it was back in the 70s and 80s -they are referred to as 'retarded', 'morons', 'simpleton', and not much is expected of them, to the point of Sacks himself being baffled by some of their actual abilities! Mind you, I am not denigrating the author. His view was the view of most of the medical community (let alone society at large) back then, and, to his credit, we see him challenging his own misconceptions and prejudices - a complete shift which will lead him to a whole new perception in one of his later book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (which will feature Temple Grandin and Stephen Wiltshire...). But, then, if he can be that unsure about autism alone, what about the rest? Interestingly enough, a whole chapter also about autism ('The Twins', featuring encounters which had inspired scenes in the movie 'Rain Man'...) was questioned too in Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind, a book by Daniel Tammet, himself one of these striking 'autist-savant'...To conclude, then, here's more a catalogue of a wide variety of people whose brains are wired differently than the 'norm' than proper lessons on the functioning of the human mind. It's not a bad thing -it's a deeply human and touching display. But, focusing on warm interpersonal relationships while neglecting the cold clinical side too often leads the author to speculate and make his own interpretations of how such people might feel and perceive the world around... Speculations which, at times, can be off the mark! It's interesting. It's engrossing. Yet, despite its jargon (both scientific and philosophical) it wasn't that instructive in terms of neuropsychology. Personally, I enjoyed it but didn't get much."
296,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12509961-eleni,5,"I was fascinated by this book of Oliver Sacks, since not only did I find it interesting in its core, ie in its description of cases of brain damage, but mostly because of Sacks' high expressive ability to bring these in front of the non- specialized audience in a figurative way. With his intelligence, insightfulness, compassion and a fine sense of humour, Sacks approaches his patients refusing to stick to stereotypes, attempting to see through the walls of isolation of the neurologically diseased. Is there a hope for his ""human islands well cut off from the main world"", well cut off from the whole to occasionally experience moments of inner peace and happiness? Through consecutive experimentation and observation Sacks sees in most of his subjects of study, his patients or his friends an ability to form a certain personal code of apprehension, a link between their selves and parts of the external world.  Finally I would like to refer to his lack of arrogance in honouring the pre-existing knowledge and the work of other specialists, as well as in presenting his interaction with renowned neurologists of his time in cases of puzzlement, bewilderment and perplexity. A really great mind."
297,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"A collection of fascinating, if now dated, case studies this neurologist dealt with. At the time he wrote, of course, none of the terms he used were offensive, and in fact the now offensive terms were technical, but be warned, words like retarded and idiot appear. Nevertheless, these accounts are fascinating."
298,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"Sacks’ neurology case studies came recommended and seemed like essential reading for someone who gravitates towards anything on a medical theme. His writing struck me as rather dry. Still, these are fascinating stories, and some, like the title piece and “Witty Ticcy Ray,” about a jazz drummer with Tourette’s syndrome, are great stand-alones. Sacks stresses the importance of acknowledging a patients’ abilities as well as their defects, and speaks of illness and identity as narratives that we construct for ourselves and live out."
299,0684853949,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32989701-diana-long,5," To say that the majority of this work was out of my depth of understanding would be accurate. However, I did find the cases discussed in this book fascinating albeit my knowledge of the intricate workings of the human brain is next to nothing. "
