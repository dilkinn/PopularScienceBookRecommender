1,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(3.5) Gavin Francis is a physician with a practice near Edinburgh. His latest book is like a taster course in medical topics. The overarching theme is the modifications the body undergoes, so there are chapters on, for example, body-building, tattoos, puberty, prosthetic limbs, dementia and menopause. Over his years in general practice Francis has gotten to know his patients’ stories and seen them change, for better or worse. These anecdotes of transformation are one source for his book, but he also applies insight from history, mythology, literature, etymology and more. So in a chapter on conception he discusses the Virgin Mary myth, Leonardo da Vinci’s fetal diagrams, the physiological changes pregnant women experience, and the case of a patient, Hannah, who had three difficult, surprise pregnancies in quick succession.We are all in the process of various transformations, Francis argues, whether by choice or involuntarily. I was less convinced by the author’s inclusion of temporary, reversible changes such as sleep, hallucinations, jet lag and laughter. And while each chapter is finely wrought, I felt some sort of chronological or anatomical order was necessary to give the book more focus. All the same, I suspect this will be a strong contender for next year’s Wellcome Book Prize because of its broad relevance to human health and its compassionate picture of bodies in flux.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."

“no one is immortal, nothing is eternal, everything is in flux . . .”
In this fascinating book, medicine and culture intersect. Gavin Francis takes as his theme the many and various changes that the human body can undergo in the course of a lifetime. An Edinburgh GP, Francis draws on twenty years of clinical experience with patients (and sometimes on interviews with other clinicians or people with unusual conditions) to explore alterations in the body. Changes dictated by the natural human lifecycle; transformations that are the result of faulty genetics, disease, or trauma; and, some “improvements” that are cosmetic or elective—all make their appearance in this book. Francis uses informal patient histories as springboards for wide-ranging reflection on myths, history, religion, philosophy, and the arts. The literature of antiquity figures prominently, but there are also references to modern works by Kafka, Atwood, Eugenides, and others. As one might expect in a book focused on the body in flux, puberty, pregnancy, anorexia, and hermaphroditism are covered; however, there are also unanticipated excursions into lycanthropy (which refers both to the transformation of a person into a werewolf and a form of madness characterized by the delusion that one is an animal), anabolic steroid use (and its less commonly known effects on personality and mood), and the changes a newborn’s heart usually undergoes (and sometimes doesn’t) when the infant takes her first breaths of air.Francis serves up a veritable feast of information about anatomy, physiological processes, and cultural material related to the body—some of it quite esoteric and arcane. His book can be demanding at times if you, like me, are not as scientifically literate as you’d like to be. I found reading the book on an electronic device to be advantageous when it came to visualizing—comprehending—some of the topics under discussion. It was useful, for example, to look at a diagram of the “double spiral of opposing helical fibres” in the middle layer of the ductus arteriosus—an important blood vessel in the fetus which allows blood to bypass developing lungs. The drawing helped me to understand how this channel for blood usually closes when a newborn begins to breathe. Francis does provide some useful photographs in the book, but I wouldn’t have minded a helpful diagram or two as well.
Shapeshifters
 is an unusual and captivating work of nonfiction that put me in mind of the works of the great American anatomist/pathologist- writer, F. Gonzalez-Crussi. It is not an easy read, but it is a rich and rewarding one—one of those rare books that merits a second reading.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with a digital copy of the book for review purposes. Thanks to Gavin Francis for writing it."

4,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3475211-basma,3,"This was an interesting read - I basically say this about all medical/biology related books but it's true. I find these subjects very interesting and intriguing especially if they're written in a way that's both informative but not too academic that it becomes dull or that it becomes too difficult for me to go through. Since not all the chapters are necessarily connected with one another, I may have skipped two or three chapters at most that I didn't really want to read about.This book discusses multiple changes that happen in our body. What it feels like to go through it, how his patients dealt with it, how he dealt with as a doctor and exploring the meaning behind it. Some of those bodily changes that are discussed is what happens when you get enough sleep or a lack of sleep, what happens to our body during puberty and menopause, pregnancy, castration and gender... among other topics. Each chapter feels like a quick and brief essay on the topic with a little back story on it's origin or how it came to be or what was like years ago before the advancement of medicine. Even though each chapter was short I felt like it took my a while to finish.(I received a free e-book copy of this title from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)"
5,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65466553-maria,5,"Amazing. Very informative, easy to understand (in my opinion). This book answered some of the questions I’d had since childhood. I especially liked the stories from the author’s professional experience, it’s truly inspiring how much he’s managed to accomplish in life, how many places he visited, how many workplaces he changed. His love for humanity is evident in the way he depicts his patients and describes his concerns about their problems, whether they are health related or not. Highly recommend this book to everyone interested in medicine, science, evolution, technological progress, life overall: you won’t be disappointed."
6,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8788163-yicheng-liu,5,"-Netgalley Review-I walked in reading this book with very few expectations; I have never read anything by this author before, but I was interested in medical writings, and tales of the human body intrigues me as a layman with no medical expertise. This book offers a sharp and comprehensive look into the nature of humanity, how it works, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, creatures in constant change and flux. With philosophical discussion our transformations from birth to adolescence to our eventual death, the book offers a well-written medical perspective juxtaposed with philosophical and cultural context from history. An interesting read that enriched my cultural landscape and my understanding of the human body, which admittedly never extentded beyond high-school biomechanics and biology classes. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the medical expertise of the author and his intended message just fine. An amazing read that I finished in three days due to the amazing writing and the intrinsic value offered by the book as it concluded on a philosophical note that brought his anecdotal case studies and knowledge full circle. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans. This is an enriching read that offer sharp insights regardless of your level of medical knowledge and is bound to fascinate."
7,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7212656-lorin,4,"I absolutely love Gavin Francis’s writing. He writes about medical history and his own experiences as a doctor with such flourish, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was fiction. Shapeshifters looks into how bodies change and how bodies adapt. It looks at pregnancy, puberty, death, laughter, menopause, mental health and more. Francis weaves in historical writing on these topics, drawing particularly on ancient publications which I found fascinating. My favourite parts though were his experiences intertwined with the topics. I loved following his patients (heavily anonymised I’m sure) through their journeys and I would happily read a full book of these sections. The prose was beautiful and he explained biological processes in ways that didn’t overwhelm me, the least scientific person on Earth.If you are interested in medicine, bizarre treatments throughout history of common issues we deal with today, and following the story of human existence from cradle to grave in an accessible and interesting way, this is the book for you. "
8,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111814349-jo-larkin,3,"This book is a series of essays on a wide variety of ""transformations"" in human lives. Well written and brimming with erudition and references to the Classics and literature. Interesting and attention holding. He undoubtedly has travelled widely and experienced much, but, though less well travelled than the author, I have trained, like him, in General Practice in Scotland in the same era and currently work there full time as a GP and feel he claims more exposure across more specialities than he can really have had in 6 months per training post. He also appears to have more active inbolvement in the secondary care of his patients now than is usual in the UK. The use of American language for an American readership put me off rather too. In all I found it readable, interesting but arrogant."
9,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49911890-kate,4,A largely enjoyable read about different parts of medicine and how our bodies transform in every moment and also on a large scale. Medical reads are my bread and butter as I love and live to work and consider healthcare as a whole. 
10,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8764476-rebecca-wilkins,3,"I got this book from Daedalus where it cost about $5 so I can get 6 books for the usual $30 for one. Hence I just get to read something that I might not want to pay $30 for. This was a little filler book to read when I couldn't face anymore political or heavy studies and yet with an interesting concept. Gavin Francis is a physician in Edinburgh, Scotland who has spent months in Antarctica and also in the deserts of central Africa. Since most women have spent years of their lives trying to change their shape, the subtitle ""A journey through the changing human body"" sounded intriguing. I am also well into the aging process which is also a major bodily change. There were moments when I was reminded of another physician's book Louise Aronson's ELDERHOOD. The book is a lot of small chapters on different topics of bodily change. ""In growth and recovery, in adapting and in aging, our bodies ineludibly change form--and with sleep, memory and learning so do our minds."" Some quotes from specific chapters: SLEEP: ""Brain scans show that when sleeping, the analytical parts of our brains tend to fall silent, while more instinctual emotional areas come alive. To fall asleep is a kind of abandonment, of consciousness as well as of the body; sleep's inherent lack of control can make it a terrifying prospect for some."" SKIN: ""To keep skin looking youthful, it's more important what you avoid than what you rub on: smoking, unhealthy food and sun exposure all add years to skin."" TATTOOS: ""For the prisoner, the body can be the only possession left--and the only weapon of rebellion."" ""In the US a quarter of all young and middle-aged people have a tattoo and there are more than 100,000 removals each year."" PREGNANCY: ""Leonardo di Vinci thought that a baby did not receive its own soul until birth."" GENDER: ""As human beings our default form is female (XX)."" ""Elements of gender differentiation are deeply rooted in the brain and in hormones--there's little doubt that there's more to a sense of gender identity than socialization."" ""As a doctor my role is to ease suffering and promote health. Gender variance holds a mirror up to the polarization of gender in our society which instructs us relentlessly and emphatically to CHOOSE. We all benefit from allowing elements of our identity to be in flux."" JETLAG: There are identifiable genes which code for these traits and ""clock"" genes can predict whether you are by habit an early or late to bed."" ""The liver has a distinct body clock calibrated to customary mealtimes, just as the brain's clock is timed to sleep cycles."" BONESETTING: ""Algebra which means bonesetting is Arabic (9th century Baghdad). The mathematics of algebra was named for bonesetting because it pulls apart 2 sides of an equation, balances them, then resolves them to find solutions--just as broken bone could be pulled apart in traction and then made to heal."" MENOPAUSE: ""Menopause isn't a disease or a deficiency, or even a constellation of symptoms, but a natural consequence of having lived 4-5 decades as a woman."" ""It is a transitional phase which is part of the aging process."" LAUGHTER: ""There are broadly 2 kinds of laughter: the kind that floods out in response to something funny, and the kind of laugh that we put into conversation to ease social interaction."" ""It isn't true that we laugh only in company--we do laugh alone but we are 30x more likely to laugh when we're with others, particularly people we like and who we want to like us (hence canned laughter on sitcom soundtracks)."" I want to comment here that since we are in the age of the novel coronavirus and many entertainers are broadcasting from home, it has been interesting to watch Colbert telling jokes without the audience or canned laughter and some of them just fall flat. As we are learning with social distancing it is the shared laughter with others that we miss the most and I think seeing the smiles and facial reactions. ""Laughter reconciles us to the fact that we're changing social animals in a restless world, it allows us to smooth the roughness of dynamic social exchange. It's cathartic of social tensions and its work is to reinforce connections between individuals."" ""The evident truth is that children laugh often and with gusto, long before they've developed the intellect required to understand the meanings of jokes or care much about the opinions of others."" ""Many people report the impulse to laugh at funerals, not out of insensitivity, but from some inarticulate need for catharsis and to release tension from the grief of the situation."" Those of us of a certain age can still remember the Mary Tyler Moore show episode about the funeral of Chuckles the clown. MEMORY: ""Schrodinger says our ability to learn and hold memories is what most makes us human."" ""To learn something new is to be engaged in a deep and intimate way with our own humanity."" ""Much of what we consider the self is intimately connected to our ability to make new memories, which we use to build images of both present and future. Loss of memory may lead to a loss of self; memory is how we weave the world into existence. There really is no before or after for the mind. There is only a now that includes memories and expectations."" ""Up to half of the dementia I see is cerebrovascular, as the body ages its blood vessels silt up and the result is a slower more forgetful brain."" DEATH: In this chapter he spends a morning with a pathologist doing an autopsy. Since I watch so many British murder mysteries on PBS I have recently become aware that it is a pathologist that performs the autopsy and the coroner is the legal person to present the conclusions to the authorities."" My first job was in medical records doing transcription and in the 60's autopsies were performed fairly regularly so I typed many reports which was a good education in medicine and anatomy. The Scottish pathologist that Dr. Francis works with is a woman (like so many on the British TV shows) and says ""It's fairly unusual for us to do a postmortem on a woman. It tends to be men who die violent or suspicious deaths."" I would think that many women have violent and suspicious actions taken against them which would hence have them end up in a morgue too. In the 60's average people dying of diseases had them, I think more as studies of the diseases affects on the body leading to death. TRANSFORMATIONS: Dr. Francis ends saying ""At its best medicine invokes and influences human change, and the possibility of change means hope."" Since I partially thought of women's bodies trying to shift their shapes through diet and exercise, the only chapter in the book on that topic somewhat was on ANOREXIA which is the ultimate shifting of usually a woman's body. The only quote I took from that chapter was his question to a patient: ""Do you think there's a part of you that would welcome death?"" Now as an Elder that question seems to pop up again as we face the ravages of aging and precursors of our ceasing to be."
11,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36478322-alexis-latner,5,"This book is an expertly guided tour of how the human body is fundamentally changeable through both natural development and different diseases. Dr. Francis tells these medical tales with fascination, compassion, and strong, clear, evocative writing. And this is highly recommended reading for writers of science fiction, fantasy and mystery - there's so much good material here!"
12,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740824-jo,4,GP Gavin Francis talks about different medical changes to the human body from pregnancy to puberty to gender reassignment with some references to specific cases that have come into his orbit. He's knowledgeable on the subjects and discusses personal cases with warmth and empathy.
13,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7270869-moray-teale,5,"I loved this fascinating book by Edinburgh GP Gavin Francis. In it he tackles a huge range of mental and physical human transformation from the typical - birth, death, puberty - to the atypical - amputation, disease and even the ""supernatural"" such as the possible origins of lycanthropy and vampirism. He traces these through his own experience of practicing and medical case histories but what makes it so fascinating is his focus on sociocultural representations of transformation and their effect on our perceptions. For example, discussing the scalp he brings together the story of a patient who began growing a horn in the middle of her forehead and expands on this theme to consider horns in the Bible and other mythologies. He seamlessly brings together history, art, mythology, ethics and quotes writers as diverse as Plato and Margaret Atwood to bring a greater understanding of change and its impact on the individual as well as wider communities and cultures. Francis's sensitivity to the experience of his subjects crosses over to his awareness of how these transformations manifest in everyday life and how they feed into current affairs, such as his discussion of pregnancy and menopause in the context of ownership over the female body. His honesty about things he has not experienced and questions that medicine has not answered for his patients or himself invite the same empathy that he shows.The writing is intensely lyrical in a way rarely experienced with non-fiction. Francis eschews the clinical language of his profession (where this is appropriate) and demonstrates an impressive facility for effective metaphor. His descriptions of the body and the mind reveal the essential beauty to be found in all forms and states of life and are surprisingly vivid and moving, particularly his final section describing an autopsy in frank but thoughtful detail.It's an enthusiastic, compassionate and beautifully written investigation of change and a testament to the individuality and mutability of the experience of being human."
14,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27507639-laura,3,"Not sure I can give this book a fair review. It wasn't the book I had imagined it to be and I am really disappointed not to be able to read the book I had imagined. It's really just more of the same as Adventures in Human Being, which is all right, but the title/blurb/artwork made me think it was going to be a more philosophical read about the indefinite divide between health and illness when all our bodies are in a constant state of flux. It wasn't. I want to read the book I imagined this was :("
15,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"Charting back to Freud and Jung going through to the likes of Sacks and Grosz, human case studies will always make for compelling, often fascinating reading, depending on the subject matter. They will always retain a perennial appeal because they are human stories relating to the human condition, which is obviously something that we can all relate to and empathise with.Being a man of medicine and a practicing GP, Francis obviously gets exposed to all sorts of medical conditions and their associated causes on a daily basis, and many of them are discussed in here, from mental illness, the menopause and the heart, to steroid abuse in body building, anorexia, memory loss to prosthetics and many more. He uses these subjects as jumping off points, allowing him to plunge in deeper and explore them further.He draws on his experience primarily from his time working in Edinburgh, but also dips into his spells from some more remote outposts from as far away as Antarctica to the stifling heat of rural West Africa. As in his previous work, his style and approach resides somewhere between Alain de Botton and Robert MacFarlane. Like their books the pages have many photos and illustrations scattered throughout to complement the text.From Descartes to Darwin, and many references to classical mythology, in particular Ovid’s “Metamorphosis”, Francis uses many other writers, researchers and other figures throughout history to emphasise his points, which add some colour and dimension to the read. So that we get quite a varied mix of people from Homer and Margaret Atwood to R D Laing and a Victorian, circus strongman, by the name of Friedrich Muller (who performed under the name of Eugen Sandow).Many myths and falsehoods are addressed and dispelled, like the influence of full moons on human behaviour. Many conditions are analysed, and many truths revealed along the way. Apparently anorexia has the highest death rate of any mental illness. The word Algebra is from the Arabic, al-jabr, meaning bone setting, which is why in southern Spain, thanks to the legacy of the Arabs, bone setters and barber surgeons were known as algebristas. This is one of those books that hold plenty of fascinating little nuggets like this.We get some really enjoyable turns of phrasing, one male corpse has a gall bladder that “felt like a bag of dice” and one molecular structure is described as having “an architecture of almost gothic complexity.” In saying that Francis’s prose can be florid and he can get a little carried away, but never for too long. This is a semi-whimsical, meditative and thoroughly enjoyable read that will please those who enjoyed “Adventures In Human Being”."
16,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101667-dirt,5,"Shapeshifters is a lovingly written book. The text oozes with appreciation and gratitude for what a remarkable machine our human body is and how lucky we are to experience life. Gavin Francis is able to clearly convey difficult and abstract topics such as gender, laughter, and memory. Check out this example of Francis describing the Jorge Luis Borges story Funes the Memorious in terms of memory and forgetting:""The vivacity and lucidity of his visual memory means that he is tortured by the subtle effects of aging, of entropy, of rot, of the creep that all livings things make moment to moment into senescence.""Holy moly! Get a load of that choice word senescence: the condition or process of deterioration with age, otherwise known as the loss of a cell's power to grow or divide (while looking that stellar word up, I discovered you can practice pronunciation and I butchered that word the first couple times). Some other great vocabulary words sprinkled throughout the book included ineludible, annealed, and gallimaufries (that last one is an articulation delight for the tongue).  The format of each selection did take some getting used to. There is a lot of jumping between the author's first hand experience, literary references, and historical context. This arrangement works well because the different sections serve to illustrate the main idea while also illuminating each other. You also learn fun facts such as the myth of werewolves may have come about as a result of porphyria. One of the symptoms of porphyria is hypertrichosis, which causes your face and hands to be covered with hair.Maybe it is because Gavin Francis hails from Scotland, but I heard the voice of Ballboy narrating this book in my head."
17,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7846533-thecosydragon,2,"Humans have an enormous capacity for change. “In Shapeshifters, physician and writer Gavin Francis considers the inevitable changes all of our bodies undergo–such as birth, puberty, and death, but also laughter, sleeping, and healing.”I started reading this book, and then put it down in favour of something else. When I picked it up again, I had to start from Chapter 1 because I honestly didn’t remember what came before that. That first chapter is one of the most interesting ones – what I would think of as true ‘shapeshifters’ such as the biology behind the myth of werewolves. After this there are discussions of pregnancy, menopause, tattoos and other body changes. Which are interesting, but just not what I expected.This book read as a bit of a jumbled mess that I found difficult to follow and thus enjoy. I’m not sure what the purpose of this book was. It is an exploration of old folk tales and history combined with the author’s clinical practice. For me, I would have liked to hear more about the clinical practice so that I could link it to what I was reading about. If I had wanted to read Ovid’s Metamorphoses, I would have done so earlier!Pick this up if you are interested in finding out the links between clinical practice and ancient texts, but don’t go expecting to hear about supernatural shape shifting. You may or may not learn something interesting from this book – it just wasn’t for me.Did you enjoy this goodreads review? If so you may find it useful to visit my blog The Cosy Dragon .

18,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7665077-hermione-laake,5,"This is a well written and at times beautiful reflection on the life and experiences of a Doctor. I am grateful to Gavin for writing this, and for describing some of his encounters with patients over the years, although if I recognised myself I am not sure I would be pleased; still, I will assume that he has taken a few liberties with the truth as all writers do, drawing on other knowledge and experience in order not to create one complete character from one case but perhaps from myriad, although I have no right to suggest this since he certainly doesn't. There were a few compelling chapters in this book. One was all about the history of anatomy and I will go back and re-read this. the other, coincidentally, coincided with another book on beauty and ugliness that I am reading, and added to my insight on this subject, which I am researching for a project. Also, I felt more empowered reading this book, as a human and as a patient. I have always felt that I am the best judge of my body, and that I should treat science with a healthy skepticism, as the ideas that it produces are often changed and changing. For example, I rarely gave my children tablets and Calpol, and then 30 years on we are now hearing that over use of drugs is not so good after all. My Irish grandmother always used to say ""everything in moderation"" and this is a good rule, if you are able to earn a good income. I am digressing. An unusual book and well worth a read."
19,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38751799-ellen-hunter,5,"Here is an exquisite collection of essays from a Scottish physician/writer. Gavin Francis has practiced medicine in a barren outpost in Africa, as base doctor and researcher in Antarctica, and in his own clinic in Edinburgh. From a variety of perspectives, Francis explores life’s mysteries, miracles and metamorphoses. He employs his understanding of human transformation from birth to puberty and from midlife to old age to elucidate the meaning of life in his own way. Discover his skiing adventure in Antarctica under a night sky, illuminated only by stars and meteors. Read his lucid explanation of how a tiny flaw in the closure of the fetal circulation system at birth, can result in a Patent Ductus Arteriosus, for centuries a life threatening condition for babies and now treatable with “a length of silk, expertly tied.” Without betraying confidences, and with respect and compassion for his patients and their unique circumstances, Gavin Francis weaves his hopeful tales."

Gavin Francis comes across as a very laid back yet knowledgeable medic which is reflected in his writing. I like the layout of chapters with a particular subject of curiosity, case studies remembered over a long career and some musings from Greek, French, and Latin philosophers among the many. I particularly enjoyed the chapters entitled Werewolves, Scalp, Anorexia, Gender and Menopause. The book is organised so that you can dip into certain chapters without having read the one before or after; each is a stand alone. I am ever fascinated by the human body, mind and our presence upon the Earth. If you are too, then I would suggest reading this book. "
21,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096318-scott-martin,3,"(Audiobook) (3.5 stars). A solid read about one doctor’s experience dealing with the various issues that humans face throughout their lives. He covers the “usual”, such as pregnancy, reproduction, growing up, growing older and death, as well as covering the medical oddities. Yet, for all of those concepts, he offers insight into these areas that many non-doctors would not consider. There is a lot to learn from this work. It wasn’t riveting, but it was interesting. The reader does an okay job with the material. Not a bad audiobook choice. "
22,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8265021-jaymee,3,"These brief essays are more like 'snapshots' where the reader is given an idea - medically and often with a cultural or literary reference - of a particular topic that supposedly centers on the idea of change. I find some of the essays a bit weak, or derivative of earlier doctor/writers' works. Still, there were insightful observations, and research was done, committing to the scientific/literary/cultural approach that these medical writers now try to achieve in showing the humanity in what they do. Recommended to readers new to the genre of medicine and literature."
23,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87437942-martin-smith,3,"A good read, but not quite the book I was expecting and maybe a little light on content. I was anticipating more of a detailed chronological account of the changes our bodies go through in life. Instead this is a series of distinct shortish chapters on various aspects of change that can effect and change us, such as bodybuilding, tattoos or gigantism. A good read, but feels a little lacking in substance. "
24,1541697529,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1998671-the-reader,4,"Refreshingly different from other medical memoirs. Sometimes the philosophising overshadows the actual cases/patients in question, but maybe that's a good thing. Lots of fun facts, such as the link between the werewolf legend and porphyria (causes confusion, panic and excessive hair growth and is often triggered by sleep disturbances - like a full moon would have caused in the days before electric lighting). Explores really interesting ideas like dreams, memories and gender fluidity."
