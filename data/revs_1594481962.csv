0,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,5,"Back in the 1980s, I took several anthropology courses at university. I emerged from them thinking that studying chimpanzees would help my understanding of humanity. In part, I was right--the missing piece to the puzzle was the bonobo (otherwise known as pygmy chimpanzee). They were not even mentioned in any class that I took at that time.Frans de Waal is an excellent guide to the behaviour and psychology of both chimps and bonobos. He also seems to have a solid grounding in human philosophers and their theories which have shaped modern society and modern primatology. He speculates how our image of ourselves would be different if we had discovered the bonobo before we became acquainted with the chimpanzee. What if we got fixated on the species where females are the dominant gender? Where males' status is specifically tied to their mothers' status? Where having sex solves almost every problem? Instead, we studied chimps first--where the males are dominant and pretty brutal about it. Where murder happens. Where ""border patrols"" go out to guard territory and pummel any interlopers. And where hunting & killing of other species is a regular occurrence. Anthropology has tended to get hung up on the violence of chimp society and ignores the behaviours that are stepping stones toward morality. There is a need in chimp society for the males to hang together or they will surely hang apart. There is cooperation, insight into the emotions and thoughts of others, and affection as well as hostility.All three species, human, chimpanzee and bonobo are closely related genetically: 98% by all accounts. It makes sense to study both of our closest relatives to gain insights into ourselves. "
1,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42934-michael,3,"As one would expect from a book called ""Our Inner Ape"" written by a popular primatologist, this book was largely about similarities between humans and our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, and the evolutionary cause of these similarities. At the heart of De Waal's argument that biologists, primatologists, and most importantly evolutionary psychologists have emphasized the connections between chimp behavior and human behavior at the expense of the other side of human behavior, which is much more analogous to that of the bonobos. The hallmark of chimp behavior, as observed by researchers is competitiveness, the struggle for power through violence and calculated social maneuvering. The image of the chimpanzee's violent streak has been used in pop culture and junk science as an eerie reminder that, unchecked by the constructs and contracts of society, man's biological makeup urges him to reckless violence. 2001: A Space Odyssey comes to mind. Through a series of anecdotes and a fairly thorough summation of the findings of the scientific community, De Waal provides a convincing argument that we've been blinded by the bludgeoning clubs to the more complex picture. Not only do bonobos - the sexiest primates you've never heard of - shed light on our empathetic sides, but the very chimps that are so often maligned for their competitiveness live in such complex societies and show such interdependence that is makes our apocalyptic visions of apes - naked or otherwise - murdering each other down to the very last individual seem silly and ignorant.For such a champion of the bonobo (the only champion of the species I can think of) De Waal spends little time on the species. From this text, I still gather that the chimpanzee is our closest relative. Past scientists didn't pick the wrong species, they merely misrepresented it. Through a series of clearly organized chapters, De Waal compares how chimps and bonobos fall on a continuum of different traits including power, sex, violence, and kindness. He's always careful to connect both sides of the story back to humanity and in so doing, shows that humans are capable of any type of behavior and these behaviors can easily be explained in evolutionary terms. Most of this is pretty obvious stuff - relatively light, enjoyable reading that affirms nature again and again.De Waal's strength lies in his enthusiasm for his research and his passionate retelling of so many great anecdotes. Two particular stories stick in my mind. The first, of a captive bonobo caring for an injured bird until it was well enough to fly from the enclosure, confirms, as much as anything else that empathy exists in nature. The reluctance of psychologists in particular and scientists in general of applying human traits to animals is largely debunked. Why would psychology and science attribute such qualities to humans but not animals? Haven't we seen again and again that we're animals ourselves? The second story, on the other end of the spectrum, of an alliance between a young upstart male chimp and an older calculating male murdering the current leader of a captive group, going so far as to squeeze this leader's testicles from his body shows the primate drive for power and the willingness to use violence to achieve that power. My only other complaint about De Waal's enjoyable book is that he often manipulates the reader's sympathies to strengthen his points. He's all too human in many of his depictions of nature. I agree with De Waal's descriptions of man's current relationship with evolution. However, I'm glad that he doesn't spend too much ink debunking social darwinism. I hope we can all agree to take that theory's weaknesses for granted."
2,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,3,"Mixed feelings about this one. I am interested in the subject but wasn't totally engaged by the writing. In particular, I felt the author adopted an unattractive condescending tone when criticising others, which is something he likes to do a lot. I had the impression some of his barbs were intended as humour, but instead he came over as rather arrogant and disdainful.That said, there is plenty of interesting stuff in here about chimpanzees and bonobos. Dr. de Waal is clearly an expert in his field and his observations cover empathy, self-awareness, reciprocity, alliance building and many other aspects of ape behaviour. He comments that previous popular books on the subject have concentrated on chimps rather than bonobos, and seeks to redress the balance. Bonobos are probably best known for constantly engaging in sexual activity. They are generally less aggressive than chimps and their societies are female dominated (also far more gender unequal than those of chimps. According to the author, male bonobos occupy a massively inferior social position to females).A cynic might suggest that the generally peaceful, female dominated and sexually permissive bonobos seem to bear little relation to most human societies. Dr. de Waal suggests otherwise. He argues, not unreasonably, that humans tend to ascribe our aggressive tendencies to our genetic ancestry, whilst unfairly rejecting the idea that our capacity for empathy has any such connection. He puts forward an intriguing theory about the origins of the nuclear family in human society. I think I would like to read some alternative theories before making up my mind, but Dr. de Waal's arguments seem plausible. I also agree with his view that there is unlikely to be much further evolution of the human body, since survival rates into adulthood are now such as to eliminate competitive advantage from any new mutations. However not all of the author's arguments about human society were as convincing. Dr. de Waal is self-consciously ""liberal"" in his social outlook and at times this led him into arguments that were tendentious and even inconsistent at times.Quite an interesting and thought provoking read though."
3,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"Great read for anyone wanting to learn more about lessons to be gained on human nature based on recent discoveries about our primate relatives, especially chimps and bonoboes. The model of chimps as Edenic creatures was darkened by discovery of their versions of warfare and murder, while the pansexual and female dominated society of bonoboes can't provide an ideal model of human society because of the contrast with our core dependence on the nuclear family. The major topics covered in the book are the foundations for human patterns of power, sex, violence, and kindness, all explored with lucid prose dosed with wry humor. He calls for more scientific approaches to empathy, cooperation, and consiliation, and argues against any simplistic biological determinism in our propensity to violence. While this book, published in 2005, is a bit academic in its scope, his later volume, The Age of Empathy, in 2009, may be even more accessible to the lay reader."
4,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,4,"The ""Inner Ape"" takes it's title from Helena Bonham Carter's answer to how she prepared for her role in the remake of the Planet of the Apes. It touches on the contrasts between bonabos and chimpanzees and their similarties to humans using anecdotes and results of studies. Information I found interesting was: chimps and bonobos split from each other 2.5 mya vs 5mya from us; and when Jane Goodall broke the news that chimps hunted to kill her message was unwelcome.Her colleagues aksed her to downplay the evidence.P47 > Females of species in which the mates stay around makes them favour mates who are gentle, protective and good providers. For males this is an all or nothing game. Consequently males are built to fight, with a tendencies to probe rivals for weak spots and a blindess to danger. Risk-taking is a male characteristic, as is the hiding of vulnerablities.P 60: Status rituals among chimpanzees are not just about power; they are also about harmony.Page 65: Both species have a one to one sex ratio at birth but end up being two females so male for chimps due to high mortality rates due to intercommunity warfare. Male bonobos lead longer, healthier lives.Page 69: Two-against-one dynamics are a familiar problem in human families with triplets, where one triplet is left out of games by the other two. The lore among hunting peoples says that men should never set off in a party of three since two will turn against the third.P71: This is consistent with the ""strength is weakness""paradox, which says the most powerful player makes the least attractive political ally.P 73 > The Ministers of France, Russia and Germany, noting China was on their side too, proclaimed their opposition to the US planned invasion of Iraq was used as an emiample of minor pl yers standing up to a powerful entity.P74: Egalitarianism is not based on mutual love and even less on passivity. It's an actively maintained condition that recognizes the universal human desire to control and dominate. Instead of denying the will to power, egalitarians know it too well. They deal with it every day.P75: Monkeys tend to support winners, which means that dominate individuals rarely meet resistance. Chimps are fundementally different in that they support losers as often as winners. The tendency to rally around underdogs creates unstable hierarchy in which power at the top is shakier than in any monkey group.P77: Egalitarian lack the social hierarchy that could impose its will in disputes, hence they depend on arbitration. P79: When we elect leaders, we in effect tell them ""You can be high up there in the capital as long as we find you useful."" Democracy thus elegantly satiefies two human tendencies: the will to power and the desire to hold it in check. [not sure that is working out for us]P129-130: An anthropologist told the story about Eipo-Papuan village heads taking their first plane trip. They wanted to leave the plane door open so they could drop heavy rocks onto enemies in the next village. It was the invention of the bomb by neolithic man.P142: Upon the author's arrival in America, from Europe [the Netherlands] he was taken back by the amount of violence in the media: everything from sit-coms, comedies, dramas, movies... If you said ""Dances With Wolves"" is violent, peopled looked at you as if you were crazy.Which do we value most: harmony or competitiveness?P150: Chimpanzee females have far fewer fiights than males, probably because they work harder to avoid them. If a fight does occur however, females rarely reconcile.P154: The nature of girls' and boys' disputes is different as well. Individual A walks up to B, who turns away as if A doesn't exist. Boys wouldn't see this as a fight. For the two girls the encounter may be excruciating. A Finnish research team observed far fewer fights among girls than boys in the school yard but when they asked the students at the end of the day the numbers were the same. They found that discord among the girls outlasted that among the boys. Boys might stay angry for hours, whereas the girls might stay angry the rest of their lives!P163: As soon as a male has lost a confrontation, he takes it out on the smaller guy and enjoys a relatively stress free life. Rather than withdrawing and sulking their quick to shift their problems to others.P192-193: In Europe, no one blinks an eye at naked breasts, which can be seen at beaches, but if the author was to say he had a gun at home everyone would be terribly upset. One culture fears guns more than breasts, another fears breasts more than guns.P204: One day a woman came into the Arnham Zoo front desk complaining that her son had been hit by a rock thrown by a chimpanzee. It turned out the son had thrown the same rock at the chimpanzee.P207: Monkeys who had been willing to work for cucumbers went on strike when other monkeys were being paid with grapes, and even threw cucumbers out of the test chamber.P231: The United States used to have the world's healthiest and tallest citizens, but now ranks at the bottom among industrialized nations and at the top in terms of teenage pregancy and infant mortality.P232: The top 1% of Americans have more to spend than the bottom 40% taken together. [from 2005, It may be worse now] ...large income disparties erode the social fabric. They induce resentment and undermine trust. The result is that the world's richest nation has one of thfpoorest he lth records. I hope these examples make you think the book is worth reading."
5,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,2,"I went into this book wanting to believe everything de Waal wrote, as his Good Natured shone such light on how much we have in common with other primates. He demonstrated that most of our ideas of goodness exist in our older genetic neighbors and that goodness is more natural than we often give it credit. Like in much of de Waal’s writing, here he compares beliefs of human behavior to observation of other primates, specifically chimpanzees and bonobos, which sport radically different social behaviors, both of which reflect how we are today. But this time it’s a very difficult book with which to agree.One would expect de Waal would collect social experiments to compare human behavior, or at least use specific anecdotes of human behavior when contrasting his primate anecdotes. Instead he namedrops concepts from Sigmund Freud, the Bible, and even the Beatles. Even when these are made in jest, they show how unscientific de Waal’s approach is. They’re nice metaphors, but with all his references to evolutionary psychology and comparative conclusions, they cease to merely be metaphors. In many cases he makes only cursory references to scientific studies, such as one that found students of Economics tend to be more egotistical - and then, without describing the study at all, decides Economics make people emotionally dead.The worst was a comparison of lesser members of a primate group deposing the alpha male for behavior they didn’t like, and directly implying that this behavior was on display in the international human community after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Not only are countries highly complex meta-interactional organizations whose opinions can only be guessed by polling, but nobody deposed the United States in anything. Their forces are still in Iraq, even after a change of presidents, and while hated, when the recent economic crisis came about the U.S. was still seen in a leadership roll. If he wanted to make the argument that there was structural similarity he would need a heck of a lot more data to suggest the same thing that happens in a closely nit pod of primates was similar to the attitudes of billions of humans spread across multiple continents who don’t interact on a regular basis. Instead de Waal merely cites this as an example and moves on, as he does with nearly every far-fetched example.He is not even consistent in his approach: in one section he argues that there is no in-born behavior, but in another argues that all sexual attitudes and rules are inherent to a species. So rape is not genetic, but a new alpha male killing everyone else’s children is. He does not acknowledge this inconsistency or discuss the possible problems presented by this flaw in his system. Things like this leave it harder to have faith in his work.Typically I’d recommend ignoring his conclusions and merely reading what he has to say about chimps and bonobos, as what they do has very obvious ramifications for our behavior. That the typically more violent chimps adopted peaceful behavior when put into groups largely made up of peace-enforcing bonobos, for instance, shows that non-human animals can learn peaceful behavior. But this is not a book of scientific studies. It’s a book of de Waal’s conclusions, inescapable, and often quite questionable. If you’re the type of reader who likes to pause frequently and fight with the author, this could be worthwhile. If you aren’t, though, I recommend reading a couple of topical reviews like that of the New York Times that merely summarizes his discoveries. It will take much less time, spare you the unscientific science, and you’ll be back out in the world mediating a whole lot sooner."
6,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12197491-bill,4,"This is the first of Franz de Waal's books I have read. He sets out to convince us that we share many social traits with other apes - both positive and negative. Specifically, he debunks the notion that civilized human society is just a thin veneer overlying a violent and aggressive foundation. He disputes Richard Dawkins' notion that ""survival of the fittest"" implies individual selection only and leaves no room for a social aspect of human/ape evolution.Along the way, he asks the question, ""What differentiates us from apes (primarily chimps and bonobos)?"" It's not tool-making; it's not politics; it's not morality. Chimps and bonobos have all those capabilities. In the end, you're left with the impression that the main difference is that we have writing and a more complex spoken language - and some of us are less hairy.I find his treatment of the question, ""How do chimps, bonobos and humans each address the problem of determining paternity?"" fascinating. Basically, chimp society is based on a male hierarchy, in which all the infants in a troop are the progeny of the alpha male. Therefore, when a new alpha comes on the scene, his first task it to kill all the infants. Bonobos solve the problem through universal sexual promiscuity - there's no way to know who the father of any given infant might be. Humans solve the same problem through pair-bonding - every male knows (within a certain margin of error) who are his progeny.I presume that ""Inner Ape"" is a prologue to de Waal's latest book, ""The Bonobo and the Atheist"", which addresses directly the claims of the ""new atheists"" regarding the origins and significance of religion and morality. I'm very much looking forward to reading that."
7,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1029562-shannon,5,"Wonderfully written on our closest genetic relatives: chimpanzees and bonobos, this book delves into the behavior of patriarchal, aggressive chimpanzees and the matriarchal, peaceful and sexually free bonobos. I find it telling that behavior-wise humans are in the middle of the behavior of the aforementioned apes. Discussing a wide variety of topics such as power, sex, food competition, language, and scapegoats the author shows how humans differ and are similar to the other great apes. The book also discusses how things we consider ""human"" i.e., empathy, theory of mind, reciprocity, and morality are found in our species' nearest kin."
8,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5081823-ivan,5,"We are all apes, like it or not. We share a lot with our great evolutionary cousins, such things as empathy, compassion, kindness, power competition, consolation and violence. Humans are the most violent and the most kind creatures on earth, we are the most bipolar creatures that exist, we do the most terrible things and we do the most kind things, our hate is unmatched, our love is without border. In some ways we are unique in many others we aren't. We should do better to protect great apes, such magnificent creatures can't be drawn to an extinction! And what it would tell about us if we can't protect even our closest living relatives? If they die off then we would be truly alone, remaining the only great primate alive. Is that what we really want? Like it or not we are primates, we all have our own inner ape inside"
9,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2685851-sarah,4,"My second read for De Waal. I enjoyed it more than ""Are We As Smart Enough …...?""It puts under scope the primates behavior -specially the chimpanzee and bonobo- and how it's linked to our behavior. If I'm asked to sum up the book in few lines I would use these;""If people laugh at primates at the zoo, they do so, I suspect, precisely because they're unsettled by the mirror held up to them.""""Primates arouse a certain nervousness because they show us ourselves in a brutally honest light, reminding us,.....that we are mere 'naked apes.'""Highly recommended.

11,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66311208-meaningless,5,"Reading this book makes me extremely sad. May be that happens when you observe or read about the lives of animals busy in their struggle for survival and procreation. They go to extreme lengths to find food, shelter and mate. The salmon fish travel thousands of miles just to lay eggs in their birthplace. After laying eggs all die in order to be consumed by their offsprings few months later. The female octopus lays just one egg in her life and dies immediately after because of exhaustion. The mayfly spends two years underwater in larva stage, then she develops wings just for 24 hours. in these limited hours she finds a mate, lays eggs and dies immediately after. Thankfully other animals and species dont have to go to such extreme measures. But their life cycles and efforts seem equally futile and meaningless. you began to think about the consequences and purpose of the animal lives in grand scheme of things. Is this all for animals just to fight over food, territory, and mates. Just to repeat same actions endlessly by every generation. I thought maybe we humans are distinct , maybe the focus of our lives and struggles are completely different from animals. May be our life cycles are distinct and meaningful. The author is keen on presenting facts and theories to make me realize that i am not distinct. That may be all my efforts are just meaningless in grand scheme of things. We may believe that we humans are distinct in possessing qualities intelligence, emotions, culture, family life, love , hatred, violence ,politics, quest for power,kindness, and empathy. We have just an evolved form of these qualities as compare to animals specially apes. Based on his lifelong work with primates, the author sees humans in an illusion of uniqueness and superiority. But he is cautious of over reductionism in applying evolutionary theory in proving his thesis.Overall the perspective in this book is fresh and very interesting at least to a layman like me.In my sadness i am just reciting the famous ghazal of Jaun Elia سر ہی اب پھوڑیے ندامت میں نیند آنے لگی ہے فرقت میں ہیں دلیلیں ترے خلاف مگر سوچتا ہوں تری حمایت میں روح نے عشق کا فریب دیا جسم کو جسم کی عداوت میں اب فقط عادتوں کی ورزش ہے روح شامل نہیں شکایت میں عشق کو درمیاں نہ لاؤ کہ میں چیختا ہوں بدن کی عسرت میں یہ کچھ آسان تو نہیں ہے کہ ہم روٹھتے اب بھی ہیں مروت میں وہ جو تعمیر ہونے والی تھی لگ گئی آگ اس عمارت میں زندگی کس طرح بسر ہوگی دل نہیں لگ رہا محبت میں حاصل کن ہے یہ جہان خراب یہی ممکن تھا اتنی عجلت میں پھر بنایا خدا نے آدم کو اپنی صورت پہ ایسی صورت میں اور پھر آدمی نے غور کیا چھپکلی کی لطیف صنعت میں اے خدا جو کہیں نہیں موجود کیا لکھا ہے ہماری قسمت میں"
12,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95156-flint,4,"Better than Jared Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee. Diamond only mentioned bonobos in passing; while Frans de Waal discusses them as much as he discusses chimpanzees while only mentions gorillas, ourang-outang, baboons and various monkeys in passing. Frans de Waal's willingness to explore bonobo sexuality make Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee"" seem prudish. Studying the behavior of our closest species relatives provide a lot of insight into human social behavior. Politically, Frans de Waal is a liberal social democrat and in the latter portions of that speculates more on modern human society that view becomes more apparent. It's not that I disagree so much with his motivations; but that it seems to not be particularly informed about actual social struggle. If anything, I think his primate studies imply even more radical conclusions the Dutch welfare state's mitigation of capitalist competition.Frans de Waal writes plainly with many amusing personal anecdotes about both his life and more often about the primates that he has known. This nicely complements the results for more formal and rigorous studies. I was very amused about the story of capuchin monkeys who went on strike because of unfair pay.

I had been thinking that they could only teach us about sex and violence and I was very satisfied with that. But thanks to Frans, I now know they can also teach us about reciprocity and reconciliation and empathy and stuff and more stuff. This book swings even higher into the tree tops because it is engagingly written, which I don't expect from scientists. Frans throws in a few gags, has opinions, and loves bonobos. As do I. Well done Frans. You can groom me anytime. "
14,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Being both more systematically brutal than chimps and more empathic than bonobos, we are by far the most bipolar ape. Our societies are never completely peaceful, never completely competitive, never ruled by sheer selfishness, and never perfectly moral. — Frans de WaalHere’s a true fact … there’s a species of great ape that exhibits the following behaviors:-	They are xenophobic and can be ruthless toward individuals who are not part of their group-	They frequently use violence to settle disputes-	They have a strong sense of hierarchy for which males struggle for dominance-	They engage in sex for social and political advantage-	They commit murder and infanticideI am, of course, referring to the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) those semi-arboreal denizens of the forests and savannahs of tropical Africa … oh … and lest I forget … these characteristics also apply to human beings (Homo sapiens). We do the exact same things. It’s not all bad though, humans and the great apes also exhibit empathy, kindness, compassion and altruism. These traits are especially prevalent in the Bonobo or pygmy chimp (Pan paniscus), the smaller, gentler and sexier relatives of the chimpanzee who live in matriarchal colonies in the Congo Basin of Central Africa. The fact that apes and humans share common behavioral traits shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest living relatives with whom we share 99% of our DNA. We also share a common ancestor that lived between 6 – 7 million years ago. There are those that therefore believe that we may be able to learn something about ourselves through a study of these primates. This is the topic that Dutch primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal explores in Our Inner Ape: A Leading Primatologist Explains Why We Are Who We Are. De Waal has spent his career studying primate social behavior and has accumulated numerous first-hand accounts of cultural traits that we share with chimpanzees and bonobos. It’s therefore natural to ask … to which species are we more similar? The answer is … we’re a hybrid of both. We have the capacity for competition and cooperation, aggression and reconciliation. De Waal evokes the image of the Janus Head (see image above) to illustrate this dual nature. Probably the most interesting part of the book were the anecdotes that de Waal’s recounts of primate behaviors he’s observed. They struck me as more intelligent, sophisticated and dare I say … human, than I would have imagined. At the same time, I'm not completely convinced that this approach offers more insight into human behavior than say … and I’m just spit balling here … studying humans directly. Goodness knows there is no shortage of test subjects (7.7 billion vs. 30 - 50,000 bonobos)."

At the same time, it was extremely interesting and worth listening to. The comparison between humans and different ancestors, other than the usual comparison of chimps, was thought provoking. The small, very human stories about specific apes really helped paint a good, natural picture of how alike we are to our cousins."

I have so much respect for Frans De Waal as a researcher and a writer. the way he picks apart and supports aspects we see in chimpanzees and bonobos and THEN applies it seamlessly to the human experience is fascinating and written in a way that's fun to read.I also just really really love bonobos.

19,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134476-lobeck,2,"if you've read chimpanzee politics, you will hear lots of rehashed and recycled ideas. i don't particularly like de waal's writing style, which is awkward due in part to the fact that english is not his native language and, i suspect, to his own personal style of speach. conclusions and trains of thought are a little too anthropocentric, focusing too frequently on what ape behavior means for humans. although all species are bound to be different in some way, we still insist on legitimizing behaviors by finding them in ""nature"" - as if humans were outside of nature.(definition of nature = the universe and its phenomena. granted this covers everything and some would argue that the word is therefore meaningless [which is one of several good reasons not to use it], but i think it is actually siginicant to consider everything to be ""natural"" since we frequently use the concept of ""unnatural"" to separate something from ourselves and pass negative judgement on it, whereas ""natural"" means that something is ok and good. consider cancer, for example, which is quite ""natural"" but very harmful to humans. humans themselves have been compared to a cancer on the earth - harmful, but again also ""natural"". so the positives and negatives associated with these categories don't hold water. the universe doesn't consider our positive and negative categories in any case. take a closer look at life, at species and their survival and societies - and you'll see that life is about survival, not quality of existence.)and now off that soapbox and onto another. i also have trouble with conclusions around gender, as i frequently do in primate research. i can't help but think they are influenced heavily by a society that sees through a gender binary paradigm, and i think there must be other lenses through which to examine behavior and other conclusions to draw. perhaps this is what i need to tackle in my future primatology PhD.there were some new facts in this book, and i can't read a book about primates and not find something interesting. but all in all, i found chimpanzee politics to be more focused, coherent, and interesting."
20,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310425-riley,4,"Though this occasionally strays into pop psychology, I enjoyed this book all and all. It is refreshing to read from someone who sees looks at natural man and sees the positives, as well as the negatives.Here’s a passage that I would say makes a good thesis of what Frans de Waal is arguing:“We hear that we have selfish genes, that human goodness is a sham, that we act morally only to impress others. But if all that people care about is their own good, why does a day-old baby cry when it hears another baby cry? This is how empathy starts. Not very sophisticated perhaps, but we can be sure that a newborn doesn’t try to impress. We are born with impulses that draw us to other and that later in life make us care about them.”The book centers on the bonobo, a great ape that I had never heard of. The author’s explanation for why:“[B]onobos fail to fit established notions about human nature. Believe me, if studies had found that they massacre one another, everyone would know about bonobos. Their peacefulness is the real problem. I sometimes try to imagine what would have happened if we’d known the bonobos first and the chimpanzee only later or not at all. The discussion about human evolution might not revolve as much around violence, warfare and male dominance, but rather around sexuality, empathy, caring, and cooperation. What a different intellectual landscape we would occupy!“It’s only with the appearance of another of our cousins that the stranglehold of the killer ape theory began to loosen. Bonobos act as if they have never heard of the idea. Among bonobos, there’s no deadly warfare, little hunting, no male dominance, and enormous amounts of sex. If the chimpanzee is our demonic face, the bonobo must be our angelic one. Bonobos make love, not war. They’re the hippies of the primate world. Science had more trouble with them than the 1960s family had with its long-haired, pot-smoking black sheep who wanted to move back home. They turned off the lights, hid under the table, and hoped that the uninvited guest would go away.”"
21,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192889-brandyn,2,"A bit of a misleading title; is more about the behavioral traits of bonobos and chimpanzees, which while interesting, doesn't really directly address the topic. I think the author assumes that since other humans are reading about primate behavior, they can draw parallels on their own. Ultimately, this just reinforces what the reader already thinks, and doesn't introduce much in new insight. Towards the very end of the book, he mentions, almost in passing, that there are bonobo/chimpanzee hybrids, and since the premise of his book is that humans have traits of both, it would have been interesting if those hybrids were front and center of the book, and not inserted as an afterthought. Granted the logistics of studying the hybrids would be really, really challenging if not impossible, but I have to say that it would be damned good reading if someone could do it. All in all, I appreciated the author's enthusiasm and interest, and it rubbed off on me somewhat, but I think it's just a fairly decent book with a seed for a different and spectacular book in it. "
22,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1269880-dave-gaston,5,"Light behavioral science served up in the form of classic field study reporting. Our Inner Ape is a guy book and a nerd science book all rolled up in one. What’s not to love? OK, the title is a little too obvious. But let’s admit it, we all have a fascination with the “other branch” just to the left (6MM yrs/ago) of our own humanity. The similarities between the two specie's societies are not earth shattering but they are somehow life affirming. Seeing ourselves through a primal reflection powerfully drives home a few truths. Waal’s conclusion is that we (ape and man) are both socially highly bi-polar, balancing between selfish and selfless acts. He stresses the social difference between Bonobo and Chimps. One is highly social and tender the other is highly social and brutal. Man seems to be the best and worst of both. 12/31/06"
23,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1149791-christine,3,"Dr. Waal compares human behavior to the apes he has studied. The book is totally varied. In many parts, he has the most fascinating information that includes lots of scientific data, his careful observations and his insightful ruminations. Other times he is annoying as shit and goes off on these tangents about politics and things he pulls out of his ass that are totally not scientific. He just seems to have a feeling and know. And I felt like he favored the bonobos big-time. I mean the chimps were in a far second place. That was weird since he himself said human behavior most closely resembles chimps. But I think he just liked watching the sex the bonobos are always having. And the bonobos reminded him of socialists and that made him a very happy man. "
24,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105211-jacqui,3,"I selected this book based on De Waal's reputation in primatology, interested in his thoughts on the root traits that define our human societies. Instead, he stumbled into politics often enough I finally set the book aside, unwilling to mix an objective study of science with a subjective analysis of world political problems. He could have cited a variety of international examples, but chose to concentrate on the USA and a few others, leaving me uncomfortable about his motives. I suggest he stick to science in his next book."
25,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049744-daniel-gon-alves,4,"Sometimes, the best answers to the human condition rely upon observation not of ourselves, but of our ape cousins. Frans de Waal, expert is primatology, explains to the reader why mankind should shift its egocentric, chauvinistic views to focus on a more fair, compared analysis of Homo Sapiens. He does it extremely well and with incredibly convincing arguments, a result of a deep research and extensive field work. A must read for everyone who wants to discover more about their own nature and who is fond of the scientific approach to life."
26,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"First of all let me acknowledge that this is among best of Science writing. When a book adds to my knowledge and propels me forward it deserves 5 stars. ""Evolutionary psychologists are making Beethoven error.... in claiming.... product resembles process"". In the last chapter Frans De Wall did have something to say about economists who use statistics to trivialize social capital, empathy and altruism!"
27,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2178526-amy,2,"This book had many interesting facts and insights. I have found myself referencing it a few times. However, thers is no over all big insight. I enjoyed it, but guess I just seemed like a bunch of ideas I already believed."
28,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12700288-paul,2,I have learned a little bit about other primates but nothing about humans so I feel cheated by the title. I suspect the title was designed to do that. 
29,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465994-katherine,4,"I assigned this book to my introductory-level biological anthropology class because it was recommended by a colleague. It is not a textbook-- it reads like an ethnographic account of non-human primates, which I really like (and I hoped the students enjoyed as well). De Waal's stories about his chimp and bonobo subjects are vivid and engaging. You get the sense that he knows and cares about these creatures as individuals.I'm a cultural anthropologist, and I cringe at some of the comments de Waal makes about certain ""postmodern"" tendencies in my field (and find myself correcting a lot of them to students). Also, some of the generalizations he makes from non-human primate behavior to human behavior are more than a little problematic from an anthropological standpoint (he's a primatologist, not an anthropologist), though I think they're probably acceptable in other fields (eg. that humans are predisposed to monogamous pair bonds... there's no evidence of this in human history, and the support de Waal provides from chimps and bonobos is contradictory, but I think this is a common assertion in some areas of psychology and economics).All that said-- as an engaging text for a college course, this worked great. If you're interested in human behavior and our non-human primate relatives, this is a nice start (but you should also consider reading Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality afterwards, which cites de Waal but corrects many of his erroneous generalizations)."
30,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10420932-alja,5,"Not only did I learn a lot about our ape cousins -- especially chimps and bonobos, with both of whom we share 99% of DNA --, I also got a fresh perspective on human behavior. By observing apes, we can find plenty of evidence of how different types of behavior are rooted in our evolution as social animals. We share both ""good"" and ""bad"" behaviors with our ape cousin, and de Waal does a good job of showing how both sides are sometimes needed to strike a balance. For instance, reconciliation is only possible when there's conflict, hierarchies help us create stability etc.I enjoyed reading stories from different ape groups and their cultures -- their lives are as interesting and nuanced as ours! --, both in the wild and in zoos. By providing a wider evolutionary perspective, we can see how environmental differences in food supply and competition shaped our closest ape cousins in a very different way: the contrast between the ""violent"" chimps and the sex-loving bonobos seems stark, but it makes sense when you take into account the differences in environment (something that Robert Sapolsky also discusses in detail in Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst as applied to differences in human societies and cultures). It goes to show how the environment shapes our behavior and can bring out both the best or worst behaviors. My key takeaway from the book is that we should embrace our ape polarity and be mindful of our tendencies in everything we do as humans; from the way we design cities to the way we design societies and foster international collaboration. There is a lot we can still learn from our ape cousins, and we shouldn't forget that we, as a species, have also evolved as social animals."
31,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,4,"Subtitled The Best and Worst of Human Nature this is a modern classic not only of human psychology and behaviour but of natural history. De Waal, one of the world's leading primatologists explores what our two closest relatives - the chimpanzee and the bonobo - can tell us abut human nature.Chapters headed Power, Sex, Violence and Kindness look at the behaviour of these two species, the chimpanzee traditionally considered to be a violent and competitive animal and the bonobo, a much more recently discovered species (sometimes referred to as the pygmy chimpanzee) which is considered to be a gentle and peaceful animal that lives in a strongly matriarchal society. The book shows that, although these reputations are largely correct, it isn't quite that clearcut, with chimpanzees in particular being more prone to gentleness than some people would think.De Waal uses lots of examples of behaviour from both of our close relatives to not only shine a light on their lives but on the way that we behave as humans with the conclusion being that we share some of our behaviours and emotional reactions with chimpanzees and others with bonobos."
32,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879000-sean-fishlock,4,"Another brilliant work by Frans de Waal, particularly the study of gender differences comparing humans, chimpanzees and bonobos. There are some amazing insights into the evolution of human behaviour. The origins of human gestures and body language, emotional differences between men and women just to name a few. There are some very fearless and frank discussion on sexual behaviour. A lot of the analysis strongly challenges modern socio-political theory including the social construct of gender as well as the nature of aggression, violence and peacekeeping.Being a book from 2005, some of the ideas have since been challenged by others, for example, the theory that wolves domesticated themselves rather than as de Waal states, that domestication of dogs was a great human achievement. This kind of gets you critical thinking and looking at human behaviour in a whole new light. It also highlights just how amazing the discoveries of science and how much more there is to learn about the animal kingdom, particularly in our closest relatives, and ourselves."
33,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56133213-ben-bernard,5,"This book - primarily a collection of personal research experience with primates and summaries of others’ primate related-research - is probably only a 4-Star book if you’re not a huge primate fan. But the author makes a fascinating case that many of the traits we consider “uniquely human” such as empathy or cruelty also show up in other animals as well. they pepper this with other observed stories and research results to demonstrate exactly how much closer we are to our furry cousins than we think. Thy also highlight that evolutionary psych monkey-human comparisons generally rely on our similarity to chimpanzees, but our similarities to highly sexed and peaceful bonobos seem obviously relevant as well. One of my favorite reads of the last 10 years. "
34,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11277082-junkle,5,"Although it is a bit old, de Waal is always up to date. One of de Waal's advantages is the evolutionary way of view, instead of the modern and ""trendy"" one of the culture.The book is really interesting, full of examples and exlpanations for every behaviour and feature. The whole text is well-written with a really simple way, while the content of the book is divided in chapters each of which is related with a general behaviour that is analysed in detail (eg. violence, sex, authority). Whereas, every chapter is different but linked to the previous (and next) one, in my opinion the chapter about Sex is the most interesting, as it gives plenty of info and evolutionary scenarios about sex-related topics in men and women behaviour."
35,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,4,"Fascinating look at ape vs. monkey vs. human behaviors. Are humans innately violent? Is nature just a game of who is the fittest? Are humans so different from the animal kingdom that we hold a special place with our own behavior that cannot be explained? Frans de Waal, a primatologist, brings the reader on journey into the world of the great apes and monkeys including chimpanzees, bonobos, macaques, and gorillas. He describes some of the most interesting experiments and the behaviors of these animals from those experiments. He deftly compares humans to animals and how similar the behaviors are between them. From power struggles, sex, violence, kindness, and altruism it certainly seems humans have inherited these traits from long ago ancestors. "

Now, I think in most cases we just think we think more!No fundamental differences especially with other primates. We actually have more in common than differences. our world is not different and as the book says “Even if we wield the better chess computer, we’re still all playing chess.” and he is not talking just about thoughts or brain power. our behavior through power, sex, family, violence or kindness is included too.a must-read and enjoyable book."
37,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Yuval Noah Harari recommends this book, and I read it for that reason. I do not have much knowledge of the studies done with apes, but this book was fascinating. I never heard of the Bonobo and learned a lot about the Bonobo from this book. There is a lot of research talked about how different the chimpanzee and the bonobo are. It seems interesting how there are many similarities between humans and these two primates. The best studies were the ones on how different their sexual behaviors are and the way they structured hierarchy. "
38,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945716-elizabeth,2,"It was hard for me to focus on De Waal’s main thesis here because I was blinded by the ignorant, inaccurate, and shockingly irresponsible portrayal of chimpanzees as mean, selfish, calculating, bloodthirsty hellbeasts. Just a single aside to point out that chimps have plenty of admirable qualities as well would have sufficed, but De Waal seemed too busy stroking his own giant ego to think all the way through his argument."
39,1594481962,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10533571-ahad,4,"Really enjoyed the book. It provides a refreshing overview of our behavioral similarities to our closest ancestors, chimps and bonobos and how ethics could be seen as extension of empathy and reciprocity seen in apes. Few times the anecdotal evidence and the side stories overshadow the main message, but even those are quite enjoyable. "

I didn’t really know what that meant. Now from this book, I know what that means. Seriously, we are really really like them. I actually liked the comparisons with human behavior and politics.
