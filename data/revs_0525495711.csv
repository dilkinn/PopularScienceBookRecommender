0,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"Richard Dawkins is not a regular writer, for in all of his writings you feel his excitement and passion for the subjects he's talking about, more so when you listen to him speak about it as I did with the audiobook version. He delivers that with rare astonishing clarity that makes you understand what he meant exactly, and sometimes he goes out of his way to clarify what he meant precisely just to prevent misunderstanding. Unlike in the heated debates many people know him from, Dawkins in his books strikes me as a calm mind, ideal scientist and truth seeker. He doesn't dismiss arguments out of hand, but discusses them and points out to their flaws, if any. In this book, compromised of 41 different essays, the author among other trivia argues passionately for the values of science, defends and explains evolution, and holds the flame of rationality against all sorts of superstition and ignorance. Through it, you can begin to see the real soul of science. "

Dawkins as evolutionary biologist, political activist, advocate for reason, purveyor of knowledge, and slayer of superfluous hogwash and evangelical claptrap. If you are unfamiliar with Dawkins as a writer, this might be a great place to start. If you are a fan, as I am, this is a front row seat in his proverbial choir. Covering a time span from 1979 (Dawkins at age 38) to 2017 (Dawkins at age 76), there is an admirable consistency of ethical intellectualism and grace at play here - I know of no other author, other than the late, great Christopher Hitchens, that even comes close."

I'd typically listen to him on the way to work & then something else the rest of the day while mulling over what he had said. He's truly a great scientist & man. A few of the highlights for me were his recognition of Terry Pratchett, the values of science, & open letter to Prince Charles. In the Author's Introduction, Dawkins writes, ""But there are poetic usages of ‘soul’ and related words that I am unashamed to embrace."" Words like 'soul' have multiple definitions & uses. He means the personal consciousness which develops & dies with the physical body. He uses other words like this occasionally, yet never in a religious sense.In the Editor's Introduction, Gillian Somerscales points out that Dawkins is ...a maker of connections, tirelessly throwing word-bridges across the chasm between scientific discourse and the broadest range of public debates... & has had to ...divert much of that energy and skill to persuading people to accept the truth of evolution at all... IMO, he does a great job of it. He makes complex subjects accessible & yet never dumbs the science down.This collection of essays is wide ranging & thought provoking. I think the Table of Contents: is enough explanation of the book. It's also important to note that it was written shortly after Carl Sagan's death, a man that Dawkins admired a lot.Part I: The Value(s) of ScienceThe Values of Science and the Science of ValuesSpeaking Up for Science: An Open Letter to Prince CharlesScience and SensibilityDolittle and DarwinPart II: All Its Merciless Glory‘More Darwinian Than Darwin’: The Darwin–Wallace PapersUniversal DarwinismAn Ecology of ReplicatorsTwelve Misunderstandings of Kin SelectionPart III: Future ConditionalNet GainIntelligent AliensSearching Under the Lamp-PostFifty Years on: Killing the Soul?Part IV: Mind Control, Mischief and MuddleThe ‘Alabama Insert’The Guided Missiles of 9/11The Theology of the TsunamiMerry Christmas, Prime Minister!The Science of ReligionIs Science a Religion?Atheists for JesusPart V: Living in the Real WorldThe Dead Hand of Plato‘Beyond Reasonable Doubt’?But Can They Suffer?I Love Fireworks, But…Who Would Rally Against Reason?In Praise of Subtitles; or, a Drubbing for DubbingIf I Ruled the World…Part VI: The Sacred Truth of NatureAbout TimeThe Giant Tortoise’s Tale: Islands Within IslandsThe Sea Turtle’s Tale: There and Back Again (and Again?)Farewell to a Digerati DreamerPart VII: Laughing at Live DragonsFundraising for FaithThe Great Bus MysteryJarvis and the Family TreeGerin OilSage Elder Statesman of the Dinosaur FancyAthorism: Let’s Hope It’s a Lasting VogueDawkins’ LawsPart VIII: No Man Is an IslandMemories of a MaestroO My Beloved Father: John Dawkins, 1915–2010More Than My Uncle: A.

3,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,5,"This could be seen as Richard Dawkins at his best. It is a collection of shorter works from journal, magazine, and newspaper articles, speeches, lectures, and online posts. The topics run the gamut of topics: the values of science, Darwinism, looking towards the future, religion (or anti-religion), current issues (at the time they were written), truth in science, humor, and tributes. These pieces really show off his skill as a writer, not just his expertise as an evolutionist.The following are some of the comments I wrote on specific pieces of text. Page numbers are in brackets []. It follows the Kindle pagination.[49] “Similar artificial selection [to non-human animals] would work with humans. Not only could you breed for tastes, you could breed for callousness, sympathy, loyalty, slothfulness, piety, meanness or the Protestant work ethic.” But, nobody today would see the results.[49] “Evidence is good that the brain contains a language ‘module’, a computational mechanism that actively seeks to learn language and actively uses grammatical rules to structure it.” Sure it seems obvious, but I would still like to know about any study that confirms this.[106] “IT IS IN the nature of scientific truths that they are waiting to be discovered, by whoever has the ability to do so.” Humans create truth. But a truth needs match reality to be correctly labeled as so. This smacks of platonic realism; nature does not come with labels saying “true.” Despite this scientific truths are discovered and not invented as some postmodernist would have it.[279] ‘Atheists for Jesus’ might be just what is needed to kick-start the meme of superniceness in a post-Christian society.” Jesus wasn’t the greatest character to emulate. And could be childish at that. I used character because I believe he is a work of fiction, and most likely never existed as a historical person.[303] “Isn’t it plausible that a clever species such as our own might need less pain, precisely because we are capable of learning faster, or intelligently working out what is good for us and what damaging events we should avoid? Isn’t it plausible that an unintelligent species might need a massive wallop of pain, to drive home a lesson that we can learn with less powerful inducement?” I found this a fascinating notion. Just as I think I know everything Richard Dawkins has to say, I read another one of his books. This collection of short works is no exception and exemplifies it. From learning something new to support for liberal issues to pure enjoy at his use of words to his humor the book was a very good read. I don’t often give a book a 5 star rating, but this one deserves it.If your a fan of Dawkins or have never read him before I can recommend this book to all but the person with a closed mind, and even then it would do them a world of good to read it."
4,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4117805-james,3,"I've now read all of Dawkins books (again!). This is his second essay collection, and for most people I think 4 or 5 stars would be appropriate because of what an original and witty writer he is, effortlessly explaining science. That said, a lot of this is (naturally) repetitive for someone fluent in his viewpoints, so while there were some excellent new ways of looking at biology there was also a lot that felt overly familiar. "
5,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,3,"As a bit of a rationalist myself, maybe not as passionate as Dawkins put I still enjoy seeing him take it to the establishment. Enjoyed the analysis of the ""Alabama Insert"" which is required to be placed in science texts to attempt to cloud the debate on evolution. Naturally, most people don't think of the age of the earth in terms of how many begats are listed in the bible, or when confronted with evidence of material billions rather than thousands of years old claim that they were put there by God to test our faith, but there are enough out there to give one pause.One interesting thought related to why religion exists for so many in the first place is related to one of the ideas of evolutionists that only those behaviors and attributes that contribute to survival will be incorporated and passed on. Religion seems to defy explanation. Dawkins brings up one possibility that humans which survived fully embraced the idea that you listen to, accept and act according to what your parents and elders tell you. So ""Keep out of the river with the crocodiles in it!"", probably equates to longer life. The one that says ""Kill a goat and plant the body near the Nerdle tree and your crops will be successful this year."", probably not so much. Since the instructions being followed do not come with a ""this is true, this is crap"" notation it is all accepted and passed on with great sincerity and enthusiasm.Since this is a compendium of his talks, articles, correspondence, etc. The book can get quite repetitive. And it is abundant with dreaded footnotes that easily could have been incorporated into the text but cause one to stop, read and return to the prior place. Still, an interesting bit of work and some intriguing ideas so good way to get the year going with your thinking cap on. "
6,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Dawkins can be both irrititating and inspiring. Irritating because of his arrogance and almost militant atheism, inspiring in showing how science and awe and wonder at the natural world is enough in itself. We don't need to have imaginary friends to experience wonder.This books is a collection of essays and speeches. They vary in content and points, but most are fascinating and fun. I enjoyed this a great deal more than I thought I would. Dawkins tackles his usual topics of magical thinking, religion, misunderstandings. Definitely recommended."
7,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,3,I guess if you already read some of Dawkins work this book won't provide as much of new insights as you expect it to. It is a compilation of different essays which mostly addresses topics he already wrote about in his previous books. I would recommend this book to everyone who never really got in touch with Dawkins books before. It's a decent start into his work.
8,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8077845-simon-fletcher,1,"Well I've finally finished this and it couldn't end soon enough. Such a disappointment.I've been reading Dawkins' work for many years now, both his scientific work and his more atheist writings and they have always been a bit of a mixed bag. His scientific writing is really good. The Selfish Gene and The Greatest Show on Earth, are great books, clear, concise and engaging. His atheist writings are however less good and his tendency to knock down straw men far too evident. This book though sits squarely in the middle, being an anthology of his writings and fails to really engage on any level. In fact some of these pieces are so bad they are almost self parody."
9,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5276878-stefanie,4,"The first section is very heavy on the science, and I have to admit my English major brain struggled with some of the information. But after that we get into more of what I expect from Dawkins -- a humorous, graceful, and bitingly clever dissection of humanity why religion is so terrible. I loved the parody of Wodehouse almost as much as the essay that describes religion as an addictive drug. Dawkins is a gem."
10,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,3,"This is one of my special books not because of the content but for the point of time it reached my life. This is one of the two books I ever bought from the payslip of my first job a couple years back. Somehow the book slipped out of my reach and this September served a good alibi to explore the work again. The work primarily comprises of 41 essays of Dawkins, the guy your religious parents told you not to read about. Essays of various dimensions from Social aspects of Darwinisms, Ethical behavior of Humans upon Non-Human creatures and Environment, Some Homage over his personal influencers including Hitchens, Various explanations and misconceptions on Evolutionary theories and the concept of Kin Selection in the gene pool. Some of the essays had to be skimmed as well but about seventy percent were worth reading for me, personally.There are many things I could agree with him and there are many things I could do disagree with certainty (depicting false accounts and analogies with questionable veracity) and interestingly, there were certain portions where I could only listen and fathom the opinions of the writer, which he himself acknowledge it so, and remain neutral and yet to be decisive about it. Maybe I have to ask myself in a couple years time again."
11,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38582182-jules,4,"A small raft is drifting in the middle of the ocean. On it a disheveled figure is thirsty and hungry under the unforgiving heat of the sun. Four equally disheveled chickens, cramped together at the opposing end of the raft are gawking at him suspiciously with bloodshot eyes. A horse comes up from the basement of the raft with a bottle of wine tucked under his arm. ""Do you guys..."" But then he notices the static tension in the air, the accusing looks of the chickens and slowly, quietly, backs away back in the basement. ""So... have you heard about the four horsemen of apocalypse?"" He starts with a high pitched voice. Startled, the chickens jump and try to group even more in an amorphous mass. He was a creationist and believed in the nobility of the soul; the chickens were pragmatic, turned from fearsome dinosaurs to defenseless flightless birds, if the horse was going to tempt Him long enough with that bottle of wine He might fall for a meal too. ""You fed thousands of people with a few fishes, why would you want to eat us?"" ""Blame my Dad. He made you that delicious."" ""Your Dad tried to roast us all with a big arse meteorite."" ""He was just playing golf, it was an honest mistake."" ""There is nothing honest about you"" they quacked. ""We are chickens, not ducks, we do no quack! What kind of clueless narrator are you?"" Then addressing to Him ""Why don't you walk on water now?"" ""I can't, I forgot my Nikes at home. Don't worry, I called Lucy, he's on the way up here in a submarine, it's just going to take a while. Until then enjoy the view. Here, use this bottle of tan oil spray on your legs, you don't want to get burnt."" The horse opened the bottle with a satisfying pop and started humming ""As we live a life of ease...A life of ease... Everyone of us has all we need...Sky of blue and sea of green...Sea of green."" "
12,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"This is the second such collection of Richard's essays and speeches, some of them going back a couple decades. I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Richard and his ex-wife Lalla Ward. The content is grouped by subject matter in to eight different sections in the book with each section introduced by editor Gillian Somerscales. Each chapter contains a separate essay / speech. Richard provides an afterword to a number of the chapters with updated information or a comment about how he could've written the essay / speech better originally. I'm a Dawkins fan so this book spoke to me and I loved most of it. It is typical Dawkins: promoting science and rationalism through subjects such as evolution and biology, and taking down religion and supernaturalism. He is preaching to his atheist and science enthusiast choir. One section didn't quite work for me: the humor section called ""Laughing at live dragons"". Dawkins is a witty chap and uses humor effectively within essays but when his humor didn't work so much for me when the whole essay is supposed to be comedy.The sections I enjoyed the most included the following subjects: anti-religion, Galapagos Islands, animal rights, and the tributes to his father and Christopher Hitchens. The animal rights essays surprised me as I've never heard Richard talk about this subject. He used his knowledge of biology to illustrate how humans underestimate the intelligence, ability to feel pain, and ability to express emotions of animals. He predicted that 100 years from now humans will look back in shame at the way animals are currently treated, just as we now look back 100 years and are embarrassed at the way certain segments of the human population were treated. I think this is a good introductory collection of essays / speeches for someone wanting to dip their toe in to Richard Dawkins' pool of work. He is often portrayed as a divisive character due to his unabashed criticism of religion but his knowledge of biological science is hard to top and his standing as a science communicator is matched by very few today. This is an excellent collection. "
13,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"This latest collection of essays is just a pleasure to read and contains some favorites that you will know along with several speeches and articles that have not been made available in the US until now. Dawkins is always a very engaging and passionate writer with the scientific credentials to back up his claims. In this collection the focus is more on the poetry and beauty of scientific thought and the need for rationalism pertaining to numerous areas of inquiry. The most heartfelt are the closing contributions which contain eulogies and remembrances of his father as well as Hitch. A fine collection covering a wide range of topics, if you read Dawkins then I would certainly recommend picking it up!"
14,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202575-lena-nechet,5,Reading this book was a joy.
15,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,Listened to the audio version and enjoyed this very much! 
16,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"""Science in the Soul: Selected Writings of a Passionate Rationalist "" written by Richard Dawkins is a collections of essays he delivered over the last three decades. Some of the essays are accompanied by the afterthought written by the author himself on what his current view on the subject is and how he would have written the essays differently.There are many subjects that this book covers ranging from rationalism, skepticism, evolution, human, etc., but there are two ideas that are new, or rather memorable, to me.The first one is that we human have a strong urge to thank something when a child who was presumed dead was later found to be alive after flood. We think that some deity is the reason behind the flood and the child being alive. Like what I learn from ""The Believing Brain"" by Michael Shermer, our brain is trying to connect dots in order to make sense of what is happening in our life, thus giving superstition a chance to prosper. But whether or not the pattern is there, we did not have a means to tickle this. Well, we have scientific method, but it is too recent compared to our pattern recognition.The second one is that it is high time a Nobel Laureate in literature was a scientist. I cannot argue against many poets or social critics receiving the prize, but we also cannot overlook the writing of great scientists like Carl Sagan whose words are poetic filled with the wisdom, rationality and science. If you have ever read a book by Carl Sagan, you will know exactly what I mean.Richard Dawkins is usually known by the heated arguments he had with creationists, but it would be better if he is known by his writings such as what is in this book."
17,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,5,"I should say that it was not easy to finish this book. I spared much time thinking and sometimes researching the points made by one of the greatest scientists of our time, Richard Dawkins. I am saying this because as also explained in the book, Richard Dawkins really gives 'science its soul' by advocating for it and calling for rational thinking. The book has some important sections. Some sections in the book are allocated to the explanation of science and some of the misconceptions of science such as science being the domain of elitists (!) or the place of science in the post-truth era. Even some of these things are funny when I read them because he really went into the basics, but also sad to see so many of us believe nonsense so much that there is literally the need to explicitly explain these points clearly. I liked the chapter Alabama insert as it explains the position of many schools in terms of teaching evolution. In this chapter. Dawkins attempts to clarify some of the misleading assertions made in Alabama Insert (here is more info on what this is: https://www.newsweek.com/alabama-biol...) Seriously, I want to print out this chapter as a one-pager and distribute it to skeptics. Actually one of my favorite sections from this book comes from this chapter: 'Since all organisms inherit all their genes from their ancestors, rather than from their ancestors unsuccessful contemporaries, all organisms tend to possess successful genes. They have what it takes to become ancestors - and that means to survive and reproduce. This is why organisms tend to inherit genes with propensity to build a well-designed machine: a body which actively works as if it is striving to become an ancestor. This is why birds are so good at flying, fish so good at swimming, monkeys so good at climbing, viruses so good at spreading. This is why we love life and love sex and love children. It is because we all, without a single exception, inherit all our genes from an unbroken line of successful ancestors. The world becomes full of organisms that have what it takes to become ancestors'."
18,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35745081-nandini,5,"Richard Dawkins' writing inspires and encourages me to write. Haha, only and if I could start. Okay, let me try here. This book is terrific, and a must-read. I especially loved his memoirs, and even more, admired him for writing and including them in this book. He remembers all those nostalgic details so well and pours them beautifully into words. I thought this book would be mostly a revision for us who have read his books, but it definitely has a lot more in it which I had missed (for instance, the memoirs and humour-rich stories). His speech for Hitchens is a masterpiece, and even though I had listened to it several times on YouTube, it was lovely and so moving to read it here. Cheers to Science!"
19,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,I was never really a fan of composite literature. I prefer his full volumes. Each essay was just too short to really get to the meat of hte arguments a nd enjoy. Not the best format for Dawkins and I have read a few. He does best when he has time to expand his ideas and let his thoughts blossom.

22,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Richard Dawkins, arguably one of the the greatest and most prolific scientists of our time, touches upon various topics in this fantastic book. He elegantly describes the poetic aspect of science and the significance of looking for the objective truth. I doubt any other scientist can expound better how natural selection works and how it's not a random process as opposed to mutations. He passionately explains why it is more likely for a scientist to lie to his/her spouse or a tax inspector than a scientific journal. This book added a wealth of information to my knowledge and the following is a number quotes you may find interesting too:- a scientists who is found fiddling research data will be shunned by his colleagues and without mercy drummed out of the profession for ever.- there is mystery but never magic, and mysteries are all the more beautiful for being eventually explained.- a Darwinian society is not the sort of society any friend of mine would wish to live.- the fundamental logic of Darwinism: everybody has ancestors but not everybody has descendants. - natural selection will tend to uphold an equillibration rule: Rob from strong bones to pay weak ones, until all are of equal strength.- we know that fire was tamed by Homo Erectus more than a million years ago, the species that was probably our immediate predecessor in evolution.- if nerves carry information about the world as it is now, genes are a coded description of the distant past. this insight follows from the selfish gene view of evolution."
23,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67747271-amy-c,3,"While Dawkins clearly espouses an unyielding penchant for evolutionary science, his rhetoric is much too incisive for my liking. Although he explicates normally abstruse concepts beautifully, much of his writing seems directed at demeaning religious groups rather than convincingly persuading others of the positive aspects of science, which is an incredibly compact subject. Rather than appealing to readers by offering substantive examples of science's beneficial impacts on the world, Dawkins attempts to dissuade readers by describing the atrocities of crimes motivated by religious beliefs. Dawkins' concentration on the detriments of religion fail to address the reason science should serve as the true guiding star in our lives; because science is a crucial facet of the world, I found Dawkins' book exhilarating until he encroached upon religious territory in an unremitting fury."
24,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20572109-sergey-antopolskiy,2,"I adore Dawkins and probably read all of his major works. And for this reason I must say, I think this book is just for fans and people very well familiar with Dawkins' life work. It is a good collection, but if you haven't read all of his books, anything else probably would be a better investment of time. "
25,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,4,"Science in the Soul by Richard Dawkins is a book hard to review. It is a collection of essays that addresses the importance of science, taken from Dawkins’ past lectures, publications, replies or letters in journals and newspapers, etc. The construction of the book is very similar to Philip Pullman’s Daemon Voices.I was totally fascinated by the first part of the book so much so that while I was listening to the audiobook, I wanted to hold a physical copy in my hand so badly, I walked to no less than four bookstores across town, hoping I could find a copy. The first part of the book is Dawkins’ view on the values of science - what it is, what it does, how it is best done. The value of science, the science of value and the science of sensibility are the overarching themes in this section. I found Dawkins’ arguments unapologetically compelling, much like the way he makes his points - ruthless and remorseless but infused with whitty sarcasm. I definitely want to reread the first third of the book (or the original content from which this book extracts) again soon.Sources for this part of the book are:- The Oxford Amnesty Lectures 1997 “The Value of Science”- “Speaking Up for Science” an open letter to a Prince Charles, 2000- BBC Radio 3, “Sounding the Century” March 24, 1998I wasn’t able to find a copy of the book that day, and I was glad. Following this gripping and thought provoking part of the book is Dawkins’ obsession over Darwinism. The second third of the book is dedicated to this subject and it’s related topics. Not that I object to Dawkins’ beliefs, I just find this topic dry and boring. Much of the content overlaps with Dawkins’ famous book “The Selfish Gene”, which I tried to read previously but couldn’t get pass the first few chapters. I skipped over much of this section of the book.In the last third of the book, Dawkins addresses what is going to happen to science and in the scientific field in the (near) future. I find some of the concepts he introduces intriguing; however, in my opinion, this section is not very well-structured, hence making the content hard to absorb. Two chapters I want to reread are “The Science of Religion” and “Is Science a Religion?”The difficulty of rating books like this (essay collections) is that rarely one feels the same across all essaypieces. As I ponder the accessibility of the content, I realize that this book is not written for the “non-believers”. Even for myself, who has basic biology and physics knowledge, I find certain parts of the book difficult to read. Anyone who does not believe in scientific inquiries would not be able to comprehend and/or tolerate Dawkins writings. If anything, I think Dawkins is urging scientists to take a firmer stand on the side of true empirical science and to protect the integrity of science through ensuring that we act in accordance to what we claim we believe in. I don’t consider myself finished reading this book because I skips a bunch of chapters. Based on my personal reading experience, it’s a 3-star book. The relevance of this book, though, makes it a 5-star book. 4-star it is then!"
26,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10117134-israel-drazin,5,"Whether one is an atheist, like Richard Dawkins, or not, whether one rejects the idea that a God exists and people lack souls, as Dawkins thinks, and even if one disagrees with him when he contends that a religious faith is a delusion, it is still worth the time spent to read his books. Dawkins (born 1941) was voted the world’s top thinker over the past hundred years in a Prospect magazine poll of 10,000 readers. He prompts us to think even if we disagree with his view. He is a famed English evolutionary biologist. As a youngster, he believed in the existence of a God because of all the wonders he saw around him, but in his early teens he came to think that the evolutionary views of Charles Darwin made more sense to him. He attained fame in 1976 for his book The Selfish Gene which was republished in 2016 in an extended version. Much of his writings criticize creationism and intelligent design. He coined the word “meme,” which rhymes with team. A meme is an element of culture or a behavior or a system of behavior or an idea that is passed on from one person or one group to another, not by the genes, but by imitation. The word comes from the Greek mimema which means imitation; a meme is something imitated, often unconsciously. It is the way that cultures are passed on. Although not mentioned by Dawkins, I think of the idea of “original sin,” which did not exist before the fourth century when it was invented by Augustine, which is contrary to Jewish theology, yet this meme is now believed by most Christians and many Jews.This book is made up of short essays that Dawkins published in the past, with a few new ones. Some few are not understandable unless one has read a detailed description of the idea in his earlier books. There are eight chapters that contain more than forty short pieces. Two of the chapters, for example, are titled The sacred truth of nature and Living in the real world. Dawkins discusses memes, for instance, in nine pages, Darwin multiple times, and atheism in his eulogy of Christopher Hitchens. The editor of the volume tells readers about Dawkins in four pages and Dawkins himself introduces the book in eleven pages."
27,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61557581-behrooz-parhami,5,"I listened to the unabridged MP3 audiobook version of this title (read by the author, Lalla Ward, and Gillian Somerscales, Random House Audio, 2017).This book brings together 42 essays and other writings of ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, spanning three decades, all sharing the author’s characteristic clarity, wit, and focus on the primacy of nature. Dawkins calls for using reason and empirical data over gut feeling (which may be influenced by superstition and blind prejudices) in all of our sociopolitical decisions. “Science in the Soul” really pertains to the role of science in ethical decision-making. Dawkins views it as inexcusable that in the age of electronic communication, which puts scientific findings at everyone’s fingertips, so many people in high places still question the facts of evolution and climate change. Why has the world grown so hostile to facts? Wrapped up in our prejudices, many of us cannot step back and take a broad look at the entire collection of prejudices that exist in the world. About the myriad of incompatible gods and religious faiths, Dawkins has said: “We are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.”I enjoyed listening to this audiobook, which provides much food for thought. Several chapters are supplied with afterwords containing updates or thoughts on how he could have written them better. These afterwords make the collection more useful, even for those who are already familiar with Dawkins’ ideas. The book has my highest recommendation."

I wish we could A) get this into the hands of the people who need to read it most and B) convince them to fucking read it, because -- as has been the case in my family my entire life -- they refuse to read anything ""secular"" because it'll definitely be an attack on their god and thus on them and it's from the devil. I'm not talking Dawkins. I'm talking Charlotte's Web! Fucking ANYTHING that's not religious, er, fundie. Everything else is dangerous, so while relatives have always felt just fine in sending me a billion evangelical brain washing propaganda books for the braindead, will they ever consider reading anything I send them? No matter if it's economics, literature, philosophy, biographies, political science, history, and of course science. It's a one way street with the closed minded theists. So ""A"" could be accomplished, but I doubt ""B"" could ever be accomplished, even with a metaphorical gun to their heads. And BTW, yes, I have read a million of their damn books they've sent me over the years. Because I'm willing to. How many have they read? That would be zero. Not even inspirational Masala's autobiography. Because she's a ""godless Muslim."" Pathetic. These damn religionists have never emerged from the Dark Ages and want to take us back there. That's one reason why this book *should* help any who have an open mind. Sadly, very few ever do. Nonetheless, recommended for those brave enough to read it."

The audiobook is partly narrated by the author himself, which is almost always a plus. The creakiness of his voice made me wonder whether he recorded this after his mild stroke in 2016. Anyway any irregularities in his voice didn’t bother me and this was a pleasant listen. The book is actually a collection of essays by this world-famous scientist. Don’t be surprised by the title. Dawkins, renowned for his outspoken atheism, is not claiming that there’s such a thing as a soul, but this title is indicative of what Sean Carroll aptly termed “poetic naturalism.” A lot of subjects are discussed in these essays. Science, religion, abortion, elections, mortality to name just a few. Some parts are funny, others are serious. Some readers might complain that the book to a large extent repeats so much from his other writings. But it also includes Dawkins’ thoughts on Brexit, Trump and current world affairs. Dawkins fans will be pleased. The man is still an unapologetic rationalist and outspoken unbeliever. The book is dedicated to Christopher Hitchens, his late brother in arms whose books I can’t recommend enough if you haven’t read them yet."

35,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11615991-kyle,4,"The incurably incurious believe that Richard Dawkins is a fanatical and heartless militant atheist, destroyer of all things magical and wonderful, and eater of babies. And many snobbish academics think that he's not a good, or pure, scientist. In their view he’s just a vulgar science populariser and religion-basher (who doesn't even do a good job of the former due to his penchant for the latter). In fact, Richard Dawkins' love of the truth, in all its beauty and brutality, his curiosity and desire to understand the world, drives him to passionately defend the best tools we have devised to get closer to truth -- science and reason -- against the onslaught of irrationality coming from the academic and far left and the religious and far right. Unlike most people, he is not afraid of the facts, nor is he afraid of using his razor-sharp wit to cut down those who try to obscure the facts. He thereby educates not only his opponents, but the millions of spectators and readers who are intellectually courageous enough to take the truth without sugar-coating.I think his tough-love approach is underpinned by, not only his own passion for understanding, but his humanism -- his passion for the public understanding of science (his title at Oxford was the Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science) and his passion to disabuse humanity of very bad and very harmful ideas. And far from being just a vulgar populariser, his scientific contributions are considerable and his reformulations and reinterpretations of his scientific colleagues' ideas are enthusiastically endorsed by these same colleagues, some of whom have said that he helped them to gain new insights into their own theories. In fact, a whole book is devoted to this: It's called ""Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think"". Some who are determined to find sexism and racism everywhere, think that he is a sexist, racist, Islamophobe. In contrast, his humanism, i.e. the fact that he holds everyone – regardless of sex, race, and religion – up to the same high intellectual and moral standards, and does not insult anyone's intelligence by treating them with kid gloves, is often unthinkingly interpreted as some kind of bigotry. In my opinion, his science writing is unmatched, or matched only by Carl Sagan, and this book is a comprehensive compilation of some of the best articles and speeches he’s written on various topics over an outstanding career. But don’t expect it all to be serious. I attended the book-promotion event in St Andrews and (I must have believed his critics more than I realised because) I was surprised at how often he had everyone laughing, both while he read parts of the book out and while he answered audience questions/challenges. The book is not only a great defense of the scientific way of thinking but it reveals how funny Dawkins can be. These two aspects are also captured well in the following Dawkins quip: ""Science: It works...bitches"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6hxo..."
36,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67884507-reader76,1,"Dawkins tries his best to denigrate religion, but then he supports the idea of aliens on other planets.""The problem of recognizing an alien intelligence arises, in its starkest form, in that branch of science known as SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. SETI deserves to be taken seriously... A strong case can be made for the probable existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.""If you are a skeptical person who is against the claim of supernatural beings from other dimensions, then this blatant hypocrisy should raise eyebrows. Dawkins is open to the possibility of artificial intelligence or aliens on other planets, but he rebukes the ""intelligent design theory"". Now that's a head scratcher. Dawkins is not an astrobiologist and is not qualified to make statements about exosolar activity.The overall book is a one-sided case. If you were a juror in a courtroom, would you make a decision after only listening to the prosecutor? You don't get to hear what the defense has to say.""If a time machine could serve up to you your 200-million-greats-grandfather, you would eat him with sauce tartare and a slice of lemon. He was a fish. Yet you are connected to him by an unbroken line of intermediate ancestors, every one of whom belonged to the same species as its parents and its children.""He doesn't give detailed, incontrovertible evidence for this claim, but it sounds entertaining when he mentions fish sauce. The basic message of the book, ""Science in the Soul"", says that in fact you are just an animal without a Christian soul."

I would recommend those specific texts to anyone but not the whole book. I think reading all of the texts only makes sense for people interested in Dawkins himself. There are, as expected, texts about evolution, others about religion. Others offer historical accounts for the future and others are deeply personal. To anyone looking for a specific area of Dawkins thought, this is not the right book.The book's overarching theme is somewhat of a reconciliation of Richard Dawkins with the word ""soul"". Is rationalist and profound scientific mind doesn't allow for the soul to be an immortal supernatural one but a humanistic one as expected but there's soul in the artistic sense in each of the 41 writings. For this reason I found some of the writings somewhat out of place in this theme but this is subjective. I guess as subjective as Dawkins' can possibly be.I'll gladly re-read the following texts with great pleasure in the future, probably multiple times:- The values of science and the science of values- Dolittle and Darwin- 'More Darwinian than Darwin': the Darwin-Wallace papers- The guided missiles of 9/11- 'Beyond reasonable doubt'?- But can they suffer?- Sage elder statesman of the dinosaur fancy- Honouring Hitch"

You'll be struck with a tinge of melancholy after reading the last article wishing that the book was twice as long as it is. Hopefully Dawkins and his editor will put together a second volume in the future.

41,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76666801-emil,5,Richard Dawkins becomes one of my favourite people.
42,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7196581-zarsmuseshtern-ya,5,"I read this book a few weeks ago in readiness for Outgrowing God, which I actually found to be quite boring with no new ideas added since the much more ground-breaking The God Delusion.In any event, I absolutely loved Science In The Soul.I am a proud atheist and humanist and Richard Dawkins, following the death of that great iconoclast, Christopher Hitchens (who gets plenty of praise, understandably, from Dawkins in this book) is probably the most prominent atheist in the world today.What I've always loved about Dawkins is that he doesn't just stick to the stuff that he is a world class-authority on, such as evolution through natural selection, and being, essentially, Darwin of the modern age.He writes on all sorts of topics through the year and while he does get on his favourite bike a few times in bashing religion, eulogising Darwin and his contemporaries and their ideas, praising Hitchens and a few other bits, the sheer breadth of things that he has a refreshing opinion on is quite something.This book is a collection of his essays, articles, speeches, presentations and even some eulogies (one of his father and uncle, in particular, I found both moving and hilarious) towards the back of the book.While this is a loose collection of his writings over a roughly 25 year period, they are helpfully organised into sections by the editor, who writes an introduction to every section. Given the book was published in 2016 but some of the articles as much as 2 decades prior to that, Dawkins very shrewdly adds an afterword to each article, written in 2016, given a modern feel to a lot of the stuff he wrote and spoke about, even praising himself for making such bad/good predictions, depending on context.I feel that a lot of people consider David Attenborough to be a British institution (myself included) but also being the 'good part' of British intellectualism, in that he isn't really big on arguments of controversies and annoying people at all. Dawkins, despite being 15 to 20 years younger than Attenborough is the other side of British intellectualism - somebody who is brash, unabashed in his ideas, but so smart and well informed that he will deconstruct most arguments and, to use a British euphemism, 'doesn't suffer fools gladly.'While I love David Attenborough and their subject matters differ greatly, so perhaps are not a like-for-like comparison, I also love how Dawkins is always seeking the truth, that he is not afraid to say science does not have all the answer (yet!) and that when there is a logical phallacy or contradiction, he just comes out and says so.He doesn't help himself, at times, by picking fights with random people on Twitter and what have you, but it isn't because he doesn't have a point.His writing style is accessible and wry humorous and at times self-deprecating in the classic British style.I haven't always enjoyed some of the other books that he is famous for (I loved The Magic of Reality way more than A Selfish Gene and The Ancestor's Tale) mostly, I suspect, because I do not come from a scientific background and hence a lot of the scientific brilliance in his books on evolution are slightly lost on me. But I absolutely love it when he writes in an engaging manner on all sorts of topics (off the top of my head, his essays on banning firecrackers and language and linguistics in this present collection, were a major highlight).It is great that a white bloke in his 70s, who in a parallel universe probably has a professorship at All Soul's College and dwelling in a crusty lab together with similar types, manages to stay level in this day and age.And for all the toxic coverage surrounding Brexit the past 3.5 years, it is his comment that 'voting on such important matters as leaving the EU should not be left to ill and misinformed people like you and me' that stands out - and he was (is) right about that.Sometimes, it takes a scientific, inquisitive, inquiring mind to give people a better dose of perspective on established issues. And when that happens - wonderful collections, such as Science In The Soul - are the bi-product - for us lucky readers."
43,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,3,"There are times in which I need a heavy dose of rational thought to ease my stress in being bombarded by inanity or outright dishonesty from reading news events. Mr. Dawkins is a decent palliative. I enjoyed reading his work entitled ‘The God Delusion’ when it came out in 2006 and also listening to some video excerpts where he lectures about a variety of topics. While the noted academic is a scientist who writes in a manner that even this less-than-brainy reader can follow, some of the essays took more effort to digest. I give him kudos for avoiding the use of scientific equations to support his explanations and, instead, resorting to clever analogies to get across his points. The anthology clearly shows that if the author were to have his body tattooed, Charles Darwin (also maybe Alfred Wallace) and Carl Sagan would be emblazoned on his chest. The guy is firmly a rationalist who embraces science with a childlike glee. While reading ‘Science in the Soul’ I imagined his gentle voice reciting the material. Even his barbs come across as polite rebuttals that caused me to occasionally laugh out loud while reading the material.While the collection is more approachable to people who are not immersed in the sciences, the first third of the book I found to be not as leisurely a read as ‘The God Delusion.’ Mr. Dawkins addresses such topics as evolution; how science is far superior to religion; cultural relativism; the prevalence of superstitions in today’s society; and examines some of the controversial evolution issues in the scientific community. I found Jerry A. Coyne’s book ‘Why Evolution is True’ to be easier to follow. Other topics addressed by Mr. Dawkins include the feasibility of people having souls; the impact of the Internet; extraterrestrials; debunking creationism; 9/11; governments supporting faith-based schools; theories on how religions formed; do animals feel pain; and how nature observes time. The last third of the collection highlights his tributes to a few dead friends and his attempts at humor. The pieces range in length from the longest being a little over forty pages to one being about a page long. There are plenty of interesting facts peppered throughout the anthology. It was published in 2017. The following excerpt gives a good indication what is in store if you read Mr. Dawkins’s book. “There’s all the difference in the world between a belief that one is prepared to defend by quoting evidence and logic and a belief that is supported by nothing more than tradition, authority or revelation. Science is founded on rational belief. Science is no religion.”I found ‘Science in the Soul’ to be a mixed bag for my tastes. This is not a surprise. Most fiction and nonfiction collections do not bat a thousand with me. But there are enough enjoyable pieces in it for me to feel I got my money’s worth from it. It was nice to get a healthy dose of rational thought compared to the surfeit of intellectual dullness that is out-and-about even in the twenty-first century. It was a nice anodyne.(Another book I recommend is one I read earlier this year that goes more in depth than Mr. Dawkins about genes is Siddhartha Mukherjee highly informative and entertaining ‘The Gene: An Intimate History.’) "
44,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78803578-mick,4,"Science in the Soul is the eleventh exhibit in my book club, and reminiscing, it reminded me how delightful Richard Dawkins is as a writer, scientist, and human being. I felt like he was insightful on many points, including topics like speciesism that I haven’t been so contemplative over. While contextualizing the state of the world, Dawkins urged us to embrace the values of science, the scientific way of thinking, and a greater sense of curiosity, as he threw many darted points towards Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, religious dogma, and pseudoscience. This book was written in 2017, and we’re far from climbing out of our dystopian reality in 2020. Throughout this collection of work, Dawkins called for actionable change.Richard Dawkins doesn’t downgrade his writing to appeal to a common denominator. His aim, not so humbly but ever so necessary, is to swell the elite. Evolutionary biology is instrumental as Dawkins offers valuable insight into our experience, quantifying our essence to our building blocks: the gene. We emerged as moral creatures (at least desirably moral) from an ethical vacuum through a process that favors short term gain over long term consequences, and it’s our scientific ability that we should use to predict and our humanistic compassion that we should use to plan, collectively. Dawkins feels, as do I, that the future is something worth sustaining and our superniceness is something worth spreading.My favorite takeaway is the concept: outward urge. It’s a regal captain in our huddle of neurons; it’s a deep sense of wonder, spirit of curiosity, and soul of science; it’s the humility of knowing what we don’t know and the drive to figure it out. The urge is inspired by what is magnificent and awesome, not what is ordinary and pedantic. The value here comes from making a mysterious universe beautiful through science, and thereby, the challenges we face intelligible through beauty. It’s a force within us that should be embraced on a ubiquitous scale, as it’s our best chance to saddle into reality as we navigate through a thicket of information. It’s surely a cure to that dastardly Dunning-Kruger effect and our arrogant posturings.While I haven’t read Dawkins’ other anthology A Devil’s Chaplain, I would recommend this book as a sampler to anyone who is interested in an overview of Dawkins’ career. This is my second favorite book we have read in the book club, right behind Michio Kaku’s Future of Humanity."
45,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6038911-david,4,"Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is hailed as one of the most enlighted science writers of our time and I agree. I've read several of his books and liked all of them. Science in the Soul is a compilation of some of his lesser-known essays and speeches and I found it good reading as well if only to get a more personable look at the scientist Richard Dawkins. Some of the earlier essays deal with the superiority of science over other means of decision making or action. Whether it's healing the sick, understanding the weather, or predicting a future event, science does these things a lot better than prayer, astrology, or psychics.Many of the other essays are about evolution, the overwhelming evidence for it and its universal acceptance by scientists. ""Today,"" he points out, ""notwithstanding local school boards in various backwoods and boondocks of the United States, no educated person doubts the truth of evolution."" His article entitled The Dead Hand of Plato, about the discontinuous mind, is also really good. In it, he describes how our tendency to split a continuous variable into discontinuous categories such as rich/poor, black/white, safe/unsafe harms our ability to think clearly about these things. Our demands for absolute yes/no answers often create false impressions of reality. Some things are safer than others and nothing is perfectly safe. People are richer or poorer than others, people have darker or lighter skin colors, and Dawkins shows how creating categories by arbitrary devices such as the poverty line or forcing people to check a box for race on a survey create false impressions and false thinking.All in all, an interesting collection of essays and well worth the read. "
46,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892350-ollie,3,"Richard Dawkins is someone who has been impressing me ever since I started reading him more than 10 years ago. It’s surprising the kind of shade that gets thrown his way, because if you read his books, they are quite enlightening and he comes across like a perfectly sane (albeit a bit arrogant) man.Dawkins’ books vary between his major theses, autobiography, and short essay collection. This book falls in the latter category. Science in the Soul is organized into several sections which deal with topics as varied as Darwinism (of course), social causes, epistemology and the search for extraterrestrial life, politics, science (of course), education, religion, and finally (and strangely) eulogies. Most of these essays come across with Dawkins’ trademark clarity and wit. The man definitely knows how to go for the jugular and he makes his point very clear, even if you don’t’ agree with it.A small setback in this book is in the curating, because some of these essays are a bit disappointing. Sometimes they are too personal (like the eulogies section which does doesn’t fit well with this book), and seem to be motivated by Dawkins’ desire to gain the moral high ground on some issues (or people) instead of more noble means. Other times, it seems like Dawkins just plain wants to show off (he insists that he could have predicted the internet 30-40 years ago, which then again, might be true). Not to mention the “humor” section of this book which is as annoying as a Rick and Morty fan.So, not Dawkins’ strongest book, but the first half has some definite great moments and full of the stuff that makes us feel in awe of the universe we live in."
47,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,0,"I'm letting this one go--read the intro, but the Kindle version had ragged right margins (at least for the teeny Kindle I have), an unforgivable no-no for me. Glad it was a library borrow and not a buy. From what I did read here, and elsewhere, I just find the ideas that self and soul are congruent and arise from the neural network to be reductive and patronizing. You carry a child--no, Dawkins, you CREATE a child, inside you--in today's environment where we are encouraged and often given the opportunities to really connect well before the child is born or even forms a neural network. Then come back and let's discuss this. I wonder if mothers have less trouble with the idea of a soul. It is such a pain trying to explain things to men. They seem to feel they have to through this whole convoluted process, like a knight in an overgrown forest, to get to some insight that's ""objective,"" when all along they could have just asked their mothers. Are the insights of mothers objective? They're experiences. Of course they're subjective. But someone who spends a lot of time in the lab, in the philosophy salon, in the jungle is not objective either, just having different experiences, with generally nothing to do with the arrival of the soul in the world. Dawkins or those who come after him will not prove that the soul =self or that it arises from electrical impulses. Why is he bothering?Meanwhile, we mothers know what we know. Anytime, just ask."
48,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22910172-sorrento,5,"This is a book of Richard Dawkins selected writings speeches and letters presented in eight sections with an introduction by his editor Gillian Summerscales. Dawkins has a real talent for educating the general public about Darwinian evolution and the book contains brilliantly well-argued sections on the wonder and power of evolution by natural selection. In this book Dawkins shows us that he is a passionate advocate for science and rationality. He is also tireless advocate for their application in the realms of our public discourse on morality, politics education and public decision making. I especially enjoyed the writings which displayed Dawkins’ wit and sense of humour. His reposts to Tony Blair, David Cameron and the Prince of Wales on issues such as segregated education in faith schools are devastating. Surprisingly in these writings Richard also reveals his love for the sermon the mount, the Kings James Bible, Christmas and carol singing.This is vintage Dawkins a well-crafted anthology displaying all of Richard Dawkins many admirable qualities in abundance. A delight to read."
49,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7598902-arni-fannar,4,"A collection of articles and speeches that are mostly excellent, however, the whole collection is slightly cheapened by some ramblings in the footnotes as well as the excessive input of the editor, with her nine introductory chapters. In an article where Dawkins praises the 2016 Reason Rally in Washington D.C. (which I admittedly didn't attend, but have seen videos covering it) the professor makes the surprisingly simplistic point that since the rally was held that automatically means there was need for it. I would be cautious to give that kind of a justification to any instance of a demonstration, or--by extension--a riot. I also can't see how that same line of reasoning couldn't be applied, as a justification, to religion. I was also not happy with the splotches of ink that came out of the printing on a few of the pages (though I don't know if that was just my copy). Aside from those minor complaints it was a solid read. 'The magnitude of a threatened punishment is inversely proportional to its plausibility,' (relating to the idea of Hell) is easily my favorite quote from the collection."

There is no wonder, with an anthology like Science in the Soul showcasing the power of his mind and work. I can't even decide which article, speech or open letter was my favourite. I love them all, really, even though there must be something in the back of my mind that says 'Pick this one!'.I can't deny there were laughter, tears and incomprehension about what I read, though that last is not on Dawkins' account, but rather on some of the people who believe some of the things he was writing to destroy. Oh, and also on the laws concerning personal ownership and the legal ability to set off fireworks in the UK. Canada has much stricter laws, I must assume.To anyone who has any reason to love science and wants to be loved by a scientist who believes no one should be spoken down to, and that everyone is capable of understanding the beauty of science and the dangers it faces from ignorance and religion, this book, and everything else Rickard Dawkins has written, is for you."
51,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68890608-gary-watts,3,"This book reaffirmed that Richard Dawkins is not my cup of tea. I had some of his books on my to read list but now will probably avoid them all. This collection of writings from Richard Dawkins gives you a taste of all his writings from The God Delusion, The Selfish Gene and so on. Richard Dawkins writes most expertly on evolution, and on that topic he brought my understanding of evolution up a level, it's amazing to look at all the creatures and plant life on the planet and how they slowly morph and dovetail with each other over vast periods of time. It's his writings on evolution that push this book up from a 2 star to a 3 star for me. But otherwise, for me he is a dogmatic person, possibly more so than many religious people. He writes with an arrogance and in many respects it seems he is missing the enquiring mind which for me is so vital in true scientific exploration. He seems to have blinkers on in many areas where he sees as fact what we don't and maybe cannot know. The enquiring mind is vital, as well as bridge building over arrogance. The antidote and perfect counterbalance to Richard Dawkins is The Science Delusion, by the scientist and author Rupert Sheldrake."
52,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44231578-ram-vasudeva,5,"Dawkins's latest is filled with as much excellence as it was in all his works from the past. It is lead as selections of his writings with an after note from Gillian Somerscales. The book is easy to read, has an up to date discussion on various facts surrounding Natural Selection. It also deals significantly about the problems of religious, spiritual ideas in the current modern world and its fight against rationalist evidence based truths. I admire this particular work of Richard which pays tribute to the great Christopher Hitchens, who was a rationalist and above all a great human being who played his part in enlightening many who believed like him and fought against mundane religious beliefs. The collection of writings in this volume are so good that one could return to it after a while and still find the contents of it gripping and learn about how evolution works. Richard also pays tribute to his father and Uncle who played an immense role in making him who he was. I would still recommend this work if you have read all or (some of) Richard's previous works. A five star for me. "

It appears to want us to make a choice between current scientific knowledge and some sort of belief in God or a higher power which guides an order in the universe. Granted that concepts of God have been abused and used for abuse, there is no reason to disregard possibilities in our unlimited universe to glorify current scientific knowledge. With all our advance biological scientific knowledge, we cannot mix a few inert chemicals together and produce life. The book does not seem to allow for any concept of a power higher than science, yet passionately avoids addressing what DOES make those chemicals come to life.The scientific facts can be accurate, but the interpretation of them in our unlimited universe seems very narrow minded.The writing is clear and interesting, but does not appear to be open minded, even though our universe appears to be open ended."
54,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376431-kem-white,3,"This collection of Dawkins' essays is enlightening and entertaining. The collection is also a bit self-serving. The essays are largely drawn from speeches Dawkins has given at various scientific conferences and seminars. Others are personal reflections presented at various ceremonies. All essays in this collection have merit and not a little wit.The ones from his chosen field of scientific endeavor are especially worthwhile. I had never read any of Dawkins' scientific writing, so it was his essays on evolution, biology, ethology, and the value of science that I found most compelling. There are a few essays on the folly and perniciousness of religion. But only a few. The book ends with a few short humorous essays and personal reflections. The book is worthwhile if you've never encountered Dawkins scientific writing. Less so if you're after polemics. Dawkins is a very talented writer. For all of this collection, you'll get clear, precise, and insightful exposition. Recommended."
55,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78945623-alan-newton,4,"(Audible) Dawkins is most insghtful, to me, when talking about Darwinian evolution and what science has tested and knows (as accurately as it can). When it comes to his vehement, almost toxic bashing of religion, I tend to switch off a little, as he doesn't appear to recognise differences between organised religion, religion, and spirituality, not to mention the evolutionary biology whereby religion and spirituality are inbuilt within the human psyche. He also, rather conveniently, ignores research such as prayer has been shown to have positive impacts on individuals, particularly in respect to depression and anxiety. His views about religion are far to often rabidly morbid and - I fear - designed to garner support and likability. He's a very educated man with some very sound views and opinions, and obvious - often comical - queries about 'organised religion' but I think he spoils it. "

Also enjoyed discovering Dawkins views on other societal issues that lay outside the realms of evolution and religion - like his dismissal of the Platonian idea that all things have a perfect 'essence' or how many don't appreciate the guidance provided by the precautionary principle.Not so interesting for me were the sections going into the more technical details of evolution and natural selection, for example logically breaking down why 'kin selection' was likely not a force in the evolution of life (zzz). Also the section on comedy I didn't really get, the style of humor seemed too intellectual and old-fashioned English for my tastes."
57,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77437796-will-thorpe,4,"This is my second ""Book"" by Dawkins, the previous was 'The God Delusion.' I'm glad I read this and even more so that I listened to it on audio since it's mostly read by Dawkins himself.There's no way to really evaluate this type of book as it's a series of essay's but I did find it very enlightening and helpful. I learned a lot and even felt motivated at times, especially at the very end when he was honoring the late Christopher Hitchens. It's made me look circumspectly and inwardly regarding who I want to be. I freed myself 6 months ago from being a very devout christian.There are elements of Dawkins I love, but in his honoring of Hitchens, I realize Dawkins summary and honor towards Hitch is a goal I think anyone would want to ascertain. The book has given me perspective and while portions clearly went over my head, I do indeed have a much better understanding of science, evolution and especially of Dawkins himself. "
58,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,3,"This is a collection of Dawkins' writings on (you guessed it) evolution and religion mostly. With his normal eloquence and obvious passion, he bemoans the fact that so many people fail to understand the first and are so eager to believe unsupportable claims of the latter. I empathize with his dismay, but I try not to let it upset me as much as it does Professor Dawkins. I've come to understand that a truly rational species has not yet evolved on Earth. Humans are capable of brief moments of rationality, but it doesn't seem to come naturally to many people. It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that humans often behave irrationally, nor should it be surprising if our species drives itself (along with others) to extinction as a result. That's evolution in action, and it happens whether you believe it or not."
59,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6222903-loren-dillon,4,"Dawkins elaborates on what he means by “soul” and how one can awe at the amount of things there is to know in the universe. From remembering and honoring his fellow men (Douglas Adams, Hitchens among others) for their contribution to the search for truth, to the dissecting of harmful ideologies mostly seen in religion (child indoctrination, god of the wars), Dawkins shows that a person can indeed have a soul and not depend on supernatural sources. This list stood out to me: “Lemma 1: When comprehension expands, gods contract –but then redefine themselves to restore the status quo. Lemma 2: When things go right, God will be thanked. When things go wrong, he will be thanked that they are not worse. Lemma 3: Belief in the afterlife can only be proved right, never wrong. Lemma 4: The fury with which untenable beliefs are defended is inversely proportional to their defensibility.”"

I'm also slightly taken aback by the fact that he doesn't practice what he preaches. One example is how important it is that nothing is fully one thing or another, but he will multiple times tell you of other things he doesn't approve of, and how incredibly bad these things are, belittling people associated with said things. Some of these pieces should also have just stayed as tweets, there were no need to elaborate them in order to get to publish them somewhere. This book is also littered with weird flexes, but okay..In conclusion, sadly he is too much a product of his time and culture for the message he is trying to deliver to come all the way across."

Purchase Science in the Soul here for just $12!

You’ve definitely heard of Richard Dawkins. Popularly known for his seminal work The God Delusion, he has moulded his reputation on his critique of religion in particular, as well as overarching systems and expectations that govern the human experience. Science in the Soul is a collection of journal extracts, as well as magazine and newspaper articles, speeches, lectures and a plethora of other public addresses. Similar to his previous works, this book touches on topics to do with religion, current events and the value of science in everyday life.Taylor - The Book Grocer"

""Science in the Soul"" is pure Dawkins - passionate, witty, snarky, sharp, and sometimes a dash douchey. This book is simply a collection of existing articles, essays, and speeches, but it's well-edited, well-organized, and impressively cohesive.Pieces are grouped thematically (examples are along the lines of ""why science is dope,"" ""why religion is not,"" ""random funny stuff""), and on the whole the quality of content is quite high. There's a few stinkers and one entirely skippable section (basically ""eulogies Dawkins has written""), but they take in aggregate on the order of 30 pages, so we'll let it slide.Dawkins' is the Feynman / Sagan of our generation; this collection nicely illustrates why."

The book is made up of short essays that Dawkins published in the past, with a few new ones. Some few are not understandable unless you have read a detailed description of the idea in his earlier books.Dawkins is a master of making science, (ir)-religion, philosophy, and a lot of other fields accessible to anyone, and this book is a worthy addition to his outstanding published work."

Whenever I pick up a book by Richard Dawkins I know I will come out the other side of the book with a deeper understanding of biology/evolution, and of science in general.This book consists of a series of essays, published elsewhere, some on the topic of science, but others not related at all, so it is a true mix of styles and material.If you have enjoyed Dawkins' writing in the past, it is a good continuation of that thread.

While I am an unreligious person, I am not overly interested in the slightly repetitive atheistic theses Dawkins is nailing on a metaphoric chapel door. I get where Dawkins is coming from and what he is getting at, but I've yet to find his religious commentary too much removed from choir-preaching that might get a few heads nodding here and there. However, his writing (and narration) keeps everything in place, and the wide array of other topics covered in this selection make it again one I don't regret reading."

This book of excerpts from various of his books, lectures and more is a good way to get to know him. Reading Science of the Soul is comforting for those of us who feel we are surrounded by people who have no logic. While some parts of the book may prove more difficult to understand due to their scientific nature it still gets the message across loud and clear. I enjoyed this book because it not only taught or explained new concepts but because it made me think. I will keep this book in my library so that my teenage daughter can read it as well."

It's an anthology though, a collection of his writing and speeches over the last 20 years, and it is definitely worth reading. The book covers a wide variety of topics, but the core is truly Darwinian Natural Selection, and it keeps returning to that theme.I love Dawkins' humour and brutal honesty.

Only, they weren't. I know his friend Hitchens got in trouble for saying that women aren't funny (i.e. professional comedians), but Dawkins is definitely less funny that the worst female comedian.

Remember science thought the world was once flat and we shouldn't travel the oceans due to sea creatures? There are so many examples where science was proved wrong as we gained more knowledge. His whole premise is flawed as there is much more that we can't yet understand so how do we use that to run a society?

112,0525495711,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506592-michael,5,"Enjoyable essays spanning twenty or thirty years from the world's most likeable atheist. I especially liked the author's comments before each essay--as well as the notes--explaining a bit about the context in which they were written, and making connections to today's world. While I find Dawkin's atheism to be grating, I have long suspected that he would be both kind and intellectually generous in person were I ever lucky enough to meet him. I think he comes off more harshly in writing than he would in person. Could be wrong.Dawkins is in love with science and with the pursuit of truth. His essays display a profound sense of wonder at the natural world we live in, and his belief in the power of science to make our world a better place (albeit a harsh one). I skipped a few of these essay, having recently finished The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, which was a long review of evolution.NdGT said it best: science is true whether you believe in it or not. The question is, is science enough? For Richard Dawkins, and for many others, I believe the answer is yes. Not for me, though. "
