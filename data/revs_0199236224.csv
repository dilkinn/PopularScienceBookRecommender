0,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22269025-robin-friedman,4,"Relativity In The Very Short Introductions SeriesThe Very Short Introductions Series of Oxford University Press offers a gateway to the broad scope of knowledge in books usually slightly more than 100 pages in length written by distinguished scholars. I have learned a great deal from the series, both about subjects that I know and about subjects that I don't. Relativity falls easily into the latter category. I wanted to give ""Relativity: A Very Short Introduction"" (2008) a try after enjoying other works in the VSI series on scientific subjects. The author, Russell Stannard, is Emeritus Professor of Physics at The Open University and has had a lengthy career as a high energy nuclear physicist. Stannard has written many books for both children and adults which attempt to explain scientific concepts in an accessible way. Stannard has also written several books on the relationship between science and religion.Stannard's book consists of two sections covering, in turn, special relativity and general relativity. Einstein developed the theory of special relativity in 1905. Stannard defines it as dealing ""with the effects on space and time of uniform motion."" In 1916, Einstein presented the general theory of relativity which ""includes the additional effects of acceleration and gravity."" Special relativity is a special case of general relativity. Stannard shows how relativity revolutionized scientific thinking and how it runs contrary to a number of ideas considered part of common sense.The book is clearly and engagingly written given the complexity of the subject. Stannard shows how Einstein developed his theories by thinking about seemingly commonplace observations together with the work of earlier scientists. Stannard offers effective illustrations and examples showing the development and content of relativity. His diagrams also are clear and useful. For both special and general relativity, the book works from the relatively simple to the extraordinarily complex. The book does not require a knowledge of mathematics but it makes, for me, a substantial use of mathematical formulas which I couldn't follow. I found it easier to understand the verbal discussions of a point rather that the formulas, regardless of how elementary the formulas might be to some readers.The book gave me, a reader with no mathematics and little background, a better understanding of relativity than I probably had a right to expect. Reading the book proved a humbling experience as well. For all Stannard's skill in writing for lay readers, this book is difficult to understand. Making readers aware of the difficulty undoubtedly is part of the purpose of the book. There is little chance that any reader will consider him or herself an instant expert after reading this VSI. I became more fascinated with the book as I continued to read. The final pages show how general relativity forms part of broad questions about the nature of the universe. It explores matters such as black holes, gravitational waves, dark matter and dark energy. Stannard offers a strong sense of the sheer enormity of the universe and its mystery. I was reminded again about how little I know and more importantly how little scientists know even with astonishing accomplishments such as the theory of relativity.The book includes a short three-tiered bibliography based upon the reader's level of mathematical knowledge. This VSI is an excellent choice for readers wanting a basic understanding of a complex and profound scientific theory.Robin Friedman"

Nice section on energy mass equivalence, resolves the twin paradox by dissolving the paradox away. Misleading frontpaper flap (pretends to promise that black holes can 'squash you without feeling a thing and [make you] live forever.' which is nonsense I think.) A fun little read overall."
2,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18649552-michael-tito,4,"I liked how the author used simple equations. Now I understand relativity more and better. The ""very short introduction"" book series seem very promising to beginners."
3,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14472623-muhsin-dogan,4,"The book was written to explain the main basic questions that asked by humanity itself. I like two important point in this point. First, the basic drawings are provided for readers to make better understanding. Second, it is about Oxford series' concept. ""The short writing concept"" provides the simplistic view for difficult cases. Those make the book reader-friendly. The last word of Stannard was good summary for whole book. I will write down here: ""[Einstein's] ...his general theory of relativity provides the essential language and tools for understanding the universe as a whole."""
4,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"When ""Time"" magazine chose Albert Einstein as the person of the century for the 20th century it was due to his incredible intellectual achievements. Among those, two stand as particularly remarkable, becoming forever uniquely associated with their inventor, in minds of general public and professional scientists alike. These are the special and general theories of relativity. Their reputation is fully deserved. The two theories of relativity forever changed the way that we look at the space, time and matter. They touch upon our deepest understanding of physical reality and their core principles have stood the test of time, a remarkable achievement after a century full of usurpations of some of our most cherished notions. The special and general relativity also have a reputation of being incredibly complex and hard to understand. In the case of special relativity this has primarily to do with the non-intuitive way that the world of four dimensions appears to us. In the case of general relativity, however, the complexity is substantially increased by the use of very advanced mathematical structures that it requires. And yet, all of the mathematical and conceptual implications of relativity stem from a few very simple ideas: the relativity of all reference frames, the constancy of the speed of light, and the equivalence of acceleration and gravitational field. It is a remarkable achievement of Russell Stannard's book to explain so much with just a very basic application of those principles. This makes it possible for a general reader to appreciate these beautiful theories without having to get bogged down in heavy mathematics. All examples in the book are intuitive and accessible. The illustrations are clear and serve to reinforce the main points in the text. One of the particularly remarkable features of this thin book is that it gives a full treatment of the ""Twins Paradox"" taking into the account the principles of general relativity - something that is usually brushed over in many other treatments. The only problem with the book that I have concerns a few math examples that are used. The math notation is not quite clear, and even as simple a math symbol as a square root is printed in a very inadequate way. Also, there are a few glaring math mistakes (3/5 is not .67), but overall these are minor points that don't distract too much from the main content of the book. I would strongly recommend this book as a good starting point for learning about relativity."
5,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14643850-sundararaman-r,3,"Not bad, but kind of a disappointment compared to the other Very Short Introduction books I've read. Usually in this series, the short length forces the authors to consider and extract the true essence of the subject and present that clearly, with some indications towards where there are nuances and complexities involved. But this book feels like it was shortened the high school student's way - a large piece of text ""shortened"" by the removal of sentences and paragraphs here and there, without really considering how that affects the flow an readability of the result. The book is informative, in that it contains a lot of information, but not educational, in that it's poorly organized and lacking in structure. "
6,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10341081-jawher,4,"Provides a pretty thorough ""introduction"" to the subject matter while offering lots of ""pause and google"" moments. Unlike the preface states, some basic grasp of mathematics and physics is necessary to get the most out of it, i'd say high school grad. All in all, clear and fluid explanations with on point illustrations."
7,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75265158-jesse-coker,5,"Fascinating and approachable--I picked this up after being confused by parts of ""A Brief History of Time"", but after finishing Stannard's book I felt confident in a general understanding of relativity. Quick to get through as well--definitely recommended. "
8,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22669210-austin,5,"About as good an introduction to a complex topic as one could hope for in a mere 100 pages. Mostly conceptual, contains very little math. Looking forward to reading Wolfgang Rindler's more mathematical treatment."
9,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,3,"I finished this so long ago that I can't really remember it, but if I remember it correctly I think it was a little too technical and difficult for being an introduction."

16,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16824309-yl-lee,5,"It's all about the theories of relativity without the math! Well, there are simple equations that anyone can handle, but not any of those that only mathematicians and physicists can stomach. Russell Stannard unfolds the concepts clearly, a step at a time, with easy-to-understand examples, diagrams and analogies.The first part of the book deals with Special Relativity. The first phenomenon introduced is time dilation - time slowing down at speeds close to that of light. It doesn't seem complex, stated as such, but the part that might be called non-intuitive about it is that one experiencing time dilation will not notice that anything is out of the ordinary (neural impulses, like everything else, are slowed accordingly), because time is not of its own, but a part of spacetime, the four-dimensional reality we live in. Apart from the effect on time, there is length contraction as well. Prof Stannard also discusses the Twin Paradox, Simultaneity (whether two events happened simultaneously or not depends on who is looking), and the (arguably) most famous equation of all time, E=mc^2. Subsequently, the reader will be introduced to General Relativity, which is, as the name clearly states, the theory of relativity for general cases, taking gravity into account. The reader must be prepared to understand (seemingly unorthodox) concepts such as light is bent when passing through a gravitational field, and space is not nothing and it can assume contours - like being curved one way or the other. The book concludes by showing the reader how everything comes together to provide scientists the understanding of much of the universe that they currently know (about 5% of it only!).This is a book I feel everyone should read. It's beautifully written, with adequate simplification of the complex, but not so much as to compromise the knowledge presented. Happy reading =)"
17,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1317185-matija,4,"At first I thought I may had been in over my head, however after rereading the starting chapters, everything seemed much clearer. Therefore, I deem this a very good introductory general relativity book. It does not assume the reader's familiarity with physics, though some general knowledge of at least Newtonian mechanics and kinetics is helpful.The book begins with an interesting premise - that it will challenge some of the most fundamental ideas regarding space, time and matter the reader likely grew up with. For example: that time passes equally quickly for everyone, that two events occur either simultaneously or one after the other and that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.The first part focuses on Einstein's special relativity, particularly on the concepts of time dilation, space contraction and event simultaneity. It often resorts to diagram-supported use case of an astronaut traveling through space in a spacecraft, being observed by a mission controller on ground to illustrate these concepts.The second part adds gravity and acceleration to the mix, introducing Einstein's theory of general relativity, thus inviting the reader to contemplate time ""running"" faster in lower gravity (that's right, time runs faster upstairs!), possibility of existence of multiple universes, the curvature of space-time and the formation and effects of black holes.Due to the book's shortness, some interesting ideas are merely glossed over or tackled very superficially, but at the end there is a suggested further reading list. Contains a little bit of math and equations, but with the exception of one chapter that can safely be skipped, nothing out of the reach of basic college physics."
18,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6043728-bryan-hall,3,"It's hard to say whether: a) this covered a topic too large and complex for a Very Short Introduction; b) it wasn't written clearly enough; or c) I didn't pay close enough attention. I bet it's a combination of (a) and (c), as I definitely was distracted by outside noises at times, and felt my mind wandering at others. But I don't think it was poorly written, though there were times when I re-read some parts and still didn't fully grasp the subtleties; again, was that my fault or the explanation's, or is it just really hard stuff that you need more than a snapshot of to fully grok? Regardless, it certainly wasn't a waste of time. It penetrated a bit deeper into my understanding of those concepts of relativity that I've heard or read more or less in passing. I definitely have a bit better grasp on curved spacetime, for example, and why near-lightspeed travel distorts time without actually letting us ""time travel"". But if the measure of understanding something is in how well you can explain it to someone else, I didn't make it all the way there through this book. PS: If you have any interest at all in the subject, I can't recommend highly enough the Very Short Introduction book on Quantum Theory. I read it probably a decade ago, and while I couldn't give a lecture on the topic today it was a great read that, at the time, made me feel like I understood the ideas pretty well. "
19,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52801352-peerawit-santipanth,4,"We all heard the myth that time goes slower the faster you go, or that time goes slower when you are in space. I never really fully grasp the idea of how a human construct, such as time, can have an impact on the physical world. It was this book that introduced this complex concept to me in a short and simple format. The idea that the speed of light is constant, at first, sounds like it is impossible. This is the core of the idea of relativity. If light speed is constant, there will certainly be inconsistencies between two or more different observers. One scenario is such that if one observer is on a spaceship traveling at a speed near the speed of light pass another observer in another ship that is stationary, how can anyone be sure that it isn't the other way around? Often on Earth it is rather easy to deal with this problem as we can use the Earth as a frame of reference for our observations. But in reality, the Earth is orbiting around the Sun, which is then flying through space within the Milky Way galaxy, this problem is even worse when the observers are in the middle of space with no significant object that can be used as a frame of reference. Perhaps we can't use anything to act as a constant for our observations and that everything in the ever expanding universe is always relative to each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Einstein's Special Relativity. "
20,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19123495-jeff,5,"The first explanation of the distinction between the Special and the General parts of Relativity that started to make sense. Now I have to go back and re-read it so I can remember how to explain what Inertial Frame of Reference is.The whole manifold concept of spacetime is fascinating, along with the effect of velocity and gravitational field on the observed rate of time. Can all points in time exist in each point in space?Got to go and study ""Frame-dragging"" more so I can get the significance of that too. Lots more to read it for - could be looked as a simple intro to the development of the math involved in Relativity for non-mathematicians.Just read it - or better yet, listen to the audio, then read it."
21,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45487643-neko,5,"It is a tiny book but terribly informative, comprehensive and succinct. The content was naturally hard to grasp with its various mathematical concepts in question but the explanation was clear enough, and with aid of diagrams and well-thought-out examples, managed to help me from one understanding to the next without me ever losing interest. Which is a great feat, as I'm rather prone to dropping books I've lost interest in. I love this book and it's taught me quite some. Basic understandings of concepts explained in this book will help in more in-depth reading on many topics."
22,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200404-logophile-heather,4,Russell Stannard is incredibly good at explaining physics in ways that makes a person feels as though they can totally understand the basics. Then he throws a monkey wrench in and explains that and so on. The effectiveness of allowing some confusion while instructing is recently getting attention in pedagogy circles and here is Russell Stannard demonstrating the practice with finesse and making me feel like I basically understand relativity as well. 
23,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38540433,3,"The more i read about physics, the more i fall in love with it. The theory of relativity is a masterpiece. It answers questions that no one have ever given them a second thought. What is time?, is it just an illusion?, is there any relationship between time and space?, is there really a force that pulls objects to earth call gravity?, and many more.Regarding the book, i believe that anyone with no background in physics will struggle to understand it."
24,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1531440-cate,5,"Hmmm...what did I learn? That the universe is a very large, WEIRD place. I learned about black holes not being infinite and also about how large objects and their gravity curves space, which has really interesting implications for geometry. I also learned about spacetime, which seems to imply that one could travel anytime, anywhere...So weird and awesome. "
25,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"I read this around 6 months ago and, flicking through it, I really can't remember what I thought of it at the time. I've read many books that have been written for the layman on relativity and this one seems to have left little impression on me. I don't recall many moments of sensing the mists clear as I read it, but it's a good general introduction."
26,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275340-luis,5,"Let's put it plain: I am usually terrible about physics and maths, and I have always thought I would never get a full glimpse of Relativity. Then I read this book and I believe I understood a good deal of it. You like physics but you can get through the numbers and equations: this is a book for you."
27,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22262554-shane-hall,4,"Like others in Oxford's VSI series, you need to be able to keep up if you're going to take away an understanding of the subject. That being said, Stannard presents Relativity clearly and well from the modern viewpoint, factoring in 100 years of additional augmentative theory and citing numerous experimental proofs. Not perfect but excellent for expanding your understanding."
28,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3000981-paulo,4,"A wonderful, brief, introduction to the very complicated and at-times mind-boggling theme of relativity. The book manages to be accessible, without cutting on rigour. This is a very good introduction to some for whom, like me, relativity is a completely new subject. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to learn a bit more about the universe, space and time."
29,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright,4,"Russell Stannard re-writes the first two books of his excellent Uncle Albert series, but for grown-ups. A clearer introduction to special and general relativity for the intelligent layman you will struggle to find anywhere."
30,0199236224,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17805486-russell,4,"I liked that the book is a concise overview of both special and general relativity. Most importantly, it takes today's understanding of particle physics and cosmology and shows how our understanding of relativity helped shape it."
