0,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"A compelling medical mystery turned thriller race against time and death—this memoir is even more than that. It's an emotional journey with the author as she tells of her frantic efforts to save her husband's life by finding the ""perfect predator"" capable of knocking out ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" She does so my mobilizing her circle of medical and scientist friends to search for bacteriophages capable of doing what all known antibiotic drugs had failed to do.  Her husband had been hospitalized for several months with an infection, and his medical condition had continued to deteriorate as he was put on life support, had experienced repeated bouts of septic shock, and was beginning to show signs of multiple organ failure. Up to fifteen different antibiotic drugs had been administered in various combinations, but any early signs of effectiveness had faded as the drug resistant 
acinetobacter baumannii
 had apparently continued to mutate into increases resistance to the drugs. The author is a research epidemiologist and therefore had the knowledge and contacts to get the ball rolling. Phage therapy is not approved by the FDA, so the use of such unorthodox treatment had to receive permission under investigational new drug (IND) (a.k.a. compassionate use) provisions of federal law. A lot of potential red tape was passed through swiftly—having the staff at UCSD behind it helped.The story begins innocently enough while the author and her husband were vacationing in Egypt. He got sick with what they at first assumed to be an old-world version of ""Montezuma's Revenge."" But things got worse so they were medevaced to Frankfurt, Germany where the infection was cultured and identified as ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" Then they were medevaced to UCSD hospital in California. The next four months were filled with a series of efforts to bring the infection and related complications under control. I as a reader (a.k.a. audio listener) was emotionally pulled along with the author's story as she told of multiple ups and downs of her husband's medical condition. The book also contains multiple short interludes in her husband's first person voice describing some of the hallucinations he had while drifting in and out of consciousness. I finally breathed a sigh of relief as the first signs of recovery were described following initial phage therapy. But that relief was shattered as the author told of another set back due to various complications. I lost track of the number of emotional ups and downs encountered in this story. I was surprise by my own adrenaline spiked responses to the book's story because I already knew the final outcome—her husband survives. Even after reaching the part of the book where the infection is finally defeated the reader is informed of the reality of a slow and drawn out recovery time. The total hospitalization time was nine months, and they anticipate the recovery time to be five times longer than that. Symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) from the long exposure to intensive care are also described.The book's narrative also provides historical background to the developments of germ theory and early utilization of bacterial phages prior to the discovery of penicillin. We learn how the success of antibiotic drugs left phage therapy largely forgotten in the Western world, but it continued to be used in the Soviet block countries during the Cold War era. Any interest in phage therapy at one time was an indication that you were a Communist. One of the really good things that has come out of this particular case is the fact that it has been thoroughly documented resulting in an ""IV-phage therapy protocol available globally to help others."" One of the details learned as a consequence of this case is that some phage and antibiotic drug pairs used together can symbiotically increase their mutual effectiveness which raises the possibility of a second life for antimicrobial resistant drugs. Findings such as these help to raise awareness of phage therapy's potential and increases the possibility for future research funding. Increased antimicrobial resistances is sort of like global warming. We know it's coming, we know why it's coming, but we don't stop doing what's causing it. Bacterial infections that have been easily controlled during the second half of the twentieth century will in the future become once again deadly uncontrollable threats. Therefore, the story in this book provides a glimmer of hope for a method of enhanced treatment of infections in the coming brave new world of drug resistant bacteria.If you are expecting the private pharmaceutical industry to develop future phage therapy, you'll probably be disappointed. There's no apparent way to make easy money with phages. They don't lend themselves to broad spectrum use. Nature developed them narrowly focused on a certain bacteria thus they have to be custom cultured for a single bacterial strain. But the good news is that phages can often mutate while on the job in response to mutations by the bacteria which is something antibiotics can't do.Here's a link to a May/June 2018 article from Mother Jones about this case:https://www.motherjones.com/environme...Here's a link to a TED talk by the author, Steffanie Strathdee:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAZU...If you can't take time to read the book, I recommend listening to the TED talk."

It all started with some small gallstones that caused his body to develop a pseudo cyst. And somehow—who knows how—he got infected with Acinetobacter baumannii. This is one nasty bacterium—resistant to EVERY single antibiotic available. Tom was flown first to Germany from Egypt and then to UC San Diego. [Key learning—Buy the medical insurance that includes medivac coverage when traveling abroad.]Strathdee is an epidemiologist focused on infectious diseases. Her husband, Patterson, is an evolutionary sociobiologist. Both had worked previously on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They had a lot of friends within the science community and knew the scientific protocols they would need to follow as they fought to keep Patterson alive until they could find something—anything—that would work to combat the bacteria. So—clearly they enjoyed a privileged situation in their search.What Strathdee stumbled upon was the use of viral phages to attack the bacteria. This is not a new idea. It was first discovered in 1917, but then quickly disregarded with the advent of antibiotics. BUT—using viral phages is tricky business. First, one must find the viral phage that will work against the target bacteria. AND, if the bacteria is one that can transform and counter phage attacks quickly—like A. baumannii; then one needs to find several viral phages that can attack simultaneously. AND, it needs to be isolated, purified and approved by the FDA. This process utilized doctors, the FDA, numerous researchers, and even the US Navy. Patterson was extremely sick for months. He went into sepsis several times and was in a coma waiting for the viral phages to become ready. The good news is that they worked!Now for the bad news, our overuse of antibiotics has led to ‘superbugs’ exhibiting AMR (Anti Microbial Resistance). There have been no new classes of antibiotics developed since the 80s, and there are strong indications that we may be headed toward a post-antibiotic era by 2050. THIS is likely to be more catastrophic to humankind than climate change.Highly recommend this important book!"

3,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946544-christopher,5,"When her husband Tom Patterson developed a stomach bug while in Egypt, epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee wasn’t concerned. The pair had traveled the world and suffered far worse than vomiting. However, when Tom’s condition deteriorates further, he’s medavacked back to the United States. Soon, doctors pinpoint his sudden decline to an antibiotic-resistant bacteria— a superbug. As treatment options begin running low, Steffanie begins her own search for a next-to-impossible cure to save her husband.At the core of The Perfect Predator is a thriller. Tom is suffering from an obviously debilitating problem— something that can kill him. The problem is stopping the killer. Yet, like all heart-stopping thrillers, there’s an infinite amount of obstacles standing in the detective’s, or health professional’s, way. That’s partially why what authors Strathdee and Patterson have done in writing this book is so invaluable. Superbugs represent a massive threat to global health, but it can be tricky boiling away the wonky science to something approachable.Steffanie and Tom, through their personal experiences, humanize superbugs, prevention, and the complex process of experimental treatment. Most of the story stems from Steffanie’s perspective as she researches a cure for her husband. She’s determined, inventive, and a skilled researcher— the perfect combination to tackle such a harrowing task. Her frustration is palpable, and provides an insightful look at the treatment process. Hospitals can seem like places where a patient walks in and treatments work like magic, but Steffanie catalogs the difficult behind-the-scenes work that occurs in the worst of circumstances.Yet, her writing goes deeper than the science. Steffanie’s drive is an intense love for her husband. As the story progresses, she explores her relationship more. Though she struggles through FDA regulations, countless journal articles, and tedious laboratory work, she also shines light onto Tom and the life they crafted together. Their bond is heartwarming and the center of this book.It’s gripping, pulse-pounding, and yet the bulk of the action takes place in laboratories and a single hospital room. Tom is confined to a coma through much of his treatment, and he recounts this in several interludes. He explains the hallucinations he experienced and the thoughts he focused on during his months in the ICU. These are some of the most effective moments in the book, as they play against the chaos happening around his hospital bed.Within all of this is both a warning and a call to action. Superbugs are growing in prominence. However, as Steffanie and the amazing assembly of doctors, nurses, researchers, and technicians who supported her husband’s case discovered, there are options. Phage therapy, a process of using specific viruses to attack bacterial infections, proved effective in this case, as well as other. However, it requires broader research and implementation. Steffanie and Tom have done tremendous work in using their personal story as a framework for understanding a necessary treatment. The Perfect Predator does what all great nonfiction books should do. While presenting the truth, it transcends genres— scientific exploration, mystery, thriller, and even romance. And it does it all by exploring an extraordinarily human story.Note: I received a free ARC of this book through NetGalley. "
4,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsAn absolutely fascinating and completely compelling read, The Perfect Predator is not one to miss. With a captivating and engaging writing style, the authors kept the pages turning as they described Patterson’s harrowing struggle to survive a superbug, and Strathdee’s dedicated attempts to find the cure.I greatly appreciated the inclusion of the science behind not only the treatments that were used throughout the book, but also related medical terms, discoveries and histories that help to flesh out the scientific and emotional backstory. Though there were a few times where the information got repetitive because Strathdee would reiterate the science behind something not long after she initially explained it, overall it was very well-presented and explained. The repetition helped reinforce the complex science behind phage therapy and wasn’t frequent or obvious enough to be distracting or negatively impact my enjoyment of the book."
5,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90265068-judith-auerbach,5,"This book is, forgive me, a real “phage-turner!” Seriously, it is a compelling read—a gripping, suspenseful medical mystery tour that turns the tide on a therapy—bacteriophage therapy—long dismissed or ignored by the medical establishment. The authors have done a wonderful job weaving together a very personal and scientific story conveyed in the voices of the two protagonists – Dr. Strathdee, the epidemiologist-wife, and Dr. Patterson, the psychologist-husband-patient. (Full disclosure – both authors are colleagues and friends of mine.) The persistent scientific sleuthing of Dr. Strathdee as her husband lay near death in the hospital from systemic infection with one of the worst multi-drug resistant bacteria is punctuated by the remembered hallucinations of Dr. Patterson—a melding of his awareness of what was going on around him with profound philosophical musings. Together, these voices tell a truly remarkable story of love, privilege, resourcefulness, determination, risk-taking, faith, and luck.The lessons from The Perfect Predator are many and related. First, it definitely “takes a village”—in this case, family members, clinicians, researchers, government officials, and even a psychic—but even more so, it “takes a catalyst” to engage all these villagers. That was Dr. Strathdee, who tapped into her own scientific training and professional network, which was vast from her and Dr. Patterson’s global work in HIV/AIDS, to leave no stone unturned—even those that were a bit risky—to save her husband’s life. Second, it also takes technology. Not only medical technology that allowed the phages to be isolated, sanitized, injected, and monitored, but also the cell phones that allowed Dr. Strathdee to communicate with everyone she needed to around the world at any time of day or night, and the Internet, which allowed her to research the medical literature. Whatever qualms we have about the overreach of such technologies, this book makes clear their value.Third, as the authors acknowledge, much of what they were able to do was a result of being in a relatively privileged position – well-connected university professors of means. Their goal is to see phage therapy scaled up sufficiently to make it accessible to people and places with much more constrained resources. Why they care about this is the fourth lesson: Dr. Patterson’s case must be put, as the authors do, in the context of the global growth of superbugs—antibiotic resistant bacteria—which already poses one of the greatest threats to global health. Combatting this threat requires being open to new—or not so new, but marginalized—approaches to prevention and treatment, and being committed to supporting the science that will lead to their discovery and implementation. It may seem hyperbolic, but it is true, to say that the authors have done the world a great service by using their very personal and emotional story—beautifully written—to save lives around the world."
6,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14451752-steffanie-strathdee,5,"As an author of this book, I won't leave a review, but am posting the review my Dad gave after he read the first draft, shortly before he died. Having gone through Tom's hospital ordeal gave me the courage to hold my Dad in my arms as he died. -Steff""Bravo, Steff and Tom! I knew the whole story of course, since Mom and I were there to help you through it, at least some of the time. But I still couldn't put the book down and read it until the wee hours of the night. Readers will know that Tom lived since they'll see his name on the cover of the book, but this isn't so much a book about the 'what', it's a book about the 'how'. I thought I knew a thing or two about phages and superbugs, but I learned a lot from reading your book. I really loved how accessible you made it for the reader; you're not writing this as Drs. Strathdee and Patterson, but as Steff and Tom. Readers will see you as people, not just scientists, and in a world where there's suddenly so much opposition to science, this book presents real facts in the format of a medical thriller. It reminded me of The Hot Zone. I'm so proud of you!"" -Al Keith"
7,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86545403-diana-mccague,5,"Riveting! Page turner! Awsome! Ok, so I’m a little biased, since I know and admire Steffanie Strathdee, one of the authors. I followed this story as it unfolded in (almost) real time via social media and had the honor of being asked to read this amazing book in advance of its publication. Despite having observed this ongoing, life-changing, roller coaster experience as it was happening, the book reeled me in and I could not stop reading from the first paragraph. My heart pounded in my chest in some places and tears poured from my eyes in others. One of the greatest lessons of this story is that love may be something we feel, but it is best expressed in action. Oh, and that phages may end up being the answer to antibiotic resistance.In the telling of her story, Dr. Strathdee beautifully melds two perspectives she brought to this experience; she is an overwhelmed human being and life partner, and she is a research scientist. If this story focused only on the science, it would lose the average reader because so many of us would assume it was beyond our comprehension. However, the descriptions of the heroic people, the roles they played, and their personalities, along with the author’s own self-examination along the way and her commitment to save her husband make this a truly accessible saga for every reader. I don’t see how anyone could help but be moved, thoroughly engrossed, and carried effortlessly along on the amazing journey detailed in The Perfect Predator."
8,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,"Everybody in reviews talking about science side of that book. When I read through it one word constantly came to me - ""love"". It's Stefannie's love to Tom that make this miracle happens, make her going on and on and on without surrender to save her husband from grips of deadly antibiotic-resistance bug. Talking about scientific side of the book it's not the first time I've heard about phage therapy, but this one explains it in so many great details that you basically can see phage attacking the bug. Another good book she mentioned is The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic--and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World - well written and joy to read."
9,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4020888-maya-sophia,4,"What an utterly fascinating and gripping book. This is about an epidemiologist whose husband, also a scientist, contracted an antibiotic resistant bacteria while they were traveling in Egypt and the extraordinary lengths that she went to to save his life using a rarely used technique in Western medicine called phage therapy. There are times when this broke my heart and made me tear up because I cannot possibly imagine how difficult this was for the both of them, to be so sick and so close to death so far from home. Strathdee covers a lot of topics from the advent of antibiotics, the factors that led to the overprescription of antibiotics, and the geopolitical reasons why phage therapy hasn't been researched in the West. Everything about it, from the medical to the historical was fascinating and it was held up beautifully by their own personal story. There were so many times that I was just in awe at how brilliant humans can be, and while there is a decent argument to be made that we wouldn't have an imminent need for phage therapy without the overuse of antibiotics, I remain amazed at the science behind phage therapy."

11,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science and Technology 2019I guess I will NOT be entering the Red Pyramid in Egypt after reading this frightening and unbelievable tale about a Canadian epidemiologist named Steffanie Strathdee and her husband Tom Patterson. Dr. Steffanie Strathdee is an infectious disease epidemiologist and Associate Dean of Global Health Sciences and Harold Simon Professor of Medicine at the University of California San Diego where she co-directs the new Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics. Strathdee has spent most of her career on HIV prevention research in marginalized populations in countries around the world, focusing on injection drug users and sex workers. She is married to Dr. Thomas L. Patterson, Professor of Psychiatry at UC San Diego. They've led HIV prevention research programs along the Mexico-US borders and have conducted many research studies together and separately.The couple were vacationing in Egypt in late 2015 when her husband comes down with a stomach bug. At first, they think Tom has food poisoning, but soon Steffanie realizes there is something far more sinister at play. Tom had contracted one of the most dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world known officially as Acinetobacter baumannii. Nicknamed the Iraqibacter, this simple bacterium is a super germ that plagued wounded soldiers who served in Iraq. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has listed Acinetobacter baumannii as one of the world's six most dangerous, top-priority, drug-resistant microbes.Tom was fighting one of the most dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world. Tom's situation quickly turned critical and he was raced to Germany and then home to California, where he fought for months to beat this deadly bug. All seems lost until Strathdee comes across a hundred-year-old forgotten cure - phage therapy. This involved injecting a bacteria-eating virus into Tom to see if it would kill off the colony of bacteria that was leading to full organ failure.This book provides a terrific background to history and the development of germ theory as well as early use of bacteriophages before the discovery of penicillin. I was shocked to learn that phage therapy is largely ignored in Western countries, but has been continued to be studied and used for major infections in the Soviet bloc countries, including a leading center in Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia in Eastern Europe.Strathdee's commitment to her husband and her descriptions of being a caretaker really hit home for me. To have someone devote themselves entirely to your well-being is something that I unfortunately know something about. Her story and comments about Tom's condition really resonated with me. I am not surprised by the awards she has won or that her commitment to her husband and its results - an IV-phage therapy protocol that can be used globally to help other people with drug-resistant infections - will land her in the history books.Towards the end of this book, Dr. Patterson and Dr. Strathdee dove into medical PTSD a bit and how Tom was traumatized by spending so much time being dangerously sick in the hospital. I've started to see medical PTSD mentioned more for people who have spent time in the hospital or been through ongoing medical traumas. It's a topic that really interests me. I often wonder how Dr. Patterson is recovering and whether or not they'll write about medical PTSD and how it affects patients since it is a topic that gets such little coverage. Either way, I hope he is doing ok and getting stronger every day.The biggest thing on the horizon for humanity, aside from global warning, is increased antimicrobial resistance. If global warming doesn't get us soon, the bugs will. I can't stress the importance of global health centers working together to come up with more options for these deadly bugs. Strathdee has offered us hope with her story of survival and dedication to finding a cure for her husband."

From then on, Tom fights a harrowing fight first in a small clinic in Egypt, then in a much larger hospital in Germany, and onward when he's shipped off to the one of the most competent hospitals in the States.

This book is every bit as tense and thrilling as any fictional thriller that could've been written about the subject. It's not the most fast-paced, admittedly. Strathdee takes a lot of detours to explain in ""normal people"" terms what's going on with Tom medically. But it never felt info-dumpy- in fact, it was all so interesting!As the sickness unfolds, it seems that everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. And though it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the outcome, it didn't stop the story from being gripping and tense. It does dip slightly in the middle part, but the story always picks back up again. I haven't read many medical thrillers, but this genre is definitely going to be more of an interest for me now. And this book, one of my favorite nonfictions I've read this year so far!(Thank you, NetGalley, for letting me read an early copy in exchange for review.)"
13,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"The Perfect Predator: A Scientist's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug is a medical memoir. In the first half of the book, the author Steffanie Strathdee tells how her husband Tom Patterson became sick in a trip to Egypt in 2015, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, later infected with Acinetobacter baumannii that was resistant to every known antibiotic to scientists. A few months later he was in coma, facing multi-organ failure and dying. The second half of book describes the battle to find the ""perfect predator"" to kill the bacteria and save the patient. In short, the perfect predator for the multi-drugs resistance bacteria is bacteriophages, i.e. viruses that feed on the bacteria. It's fascinating to read about the history of bacteriophage therapy. The therapy was discovered in 1915 (before Penicillin), but largely forgotten by the Western world after WII. It was not only because antibiotics were a much better weapon to fight bacteria infections (easier to manufacture, one type of antibiotic kills many types of bacteria), but also for political reasons. For a very long time bacteriophage therapy was only available in Russian and Eastern European countries such as Georgia. The tide is starting to change as multi-drugs resistance bacteria (known as super-bugs) killing more and more people while no new category of antibiotics has been discovered since 1980s. Tom Patterson is the patient zero of the new wave bacteriophage therapy in United States. Today's bacteriophage therapy, even in its experimental stage and a long way from FDA approval, has moved way beyond what its inventor could possibly imagine. It's a high-tech, personalized medicine, in some cases even including gene editing. It was a fungus that gave us penicillin. Now it's time for recruiting viruses. The Darwinian dance is beautiful and serendipitous.Both Stefanie Strathdee and Tom Patterson became bacteriophage therapy advocate afterwards. Today Steffanie Strathdee co-directs The Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics at UC San Diego School of Medicine."

Getting sick on vacation was nothing new to Tom, however, as he often traveled, ate, and lived a bit on the wild side. But when what they thought was food poisoning grew increasingly worse, his wife Steffanie Strathdee took him to a clinic in Luxor. Soon, the humble clinic could do nothing for Tom and he was medivac’d to a state-of-the-art hospital in Germany, where it was determined that he had an infection of Acinetobacter baumannii. Ordinarily a relatively harmless bacteria that resides in our guts, A. baumannii has become a “superbug” - an antibiotic resistant bacteria - and one of the “worst bacteria on the planet.”This is an interesting story about how Strathdee, a global health specialist and epidemiologist, was able to find a controversial and fairly obscure treatment for her husband using bacteriophages, or “phages” for short. Phages are tiny viruses that prey naturally upon bacteria. And while the story of Tom’s illness, which left him in a coma for two months, is fairly compelling in its own right, I felt this alternative treatment was the real story in light of our overuse of antibiotics and their growing resistance. Yet as interesting as the story is, I had a hard time getting into it - not really connecting until I was more than 100 pages in. Still, the story is well-told and you get a decent feeling for what it was like, the ups and downs and the worry and feelings of helplessness. I’m not as enthusiastic about it as most other readers, but I think it’s an important direction for the future as more and more bacteria stop responding to the drugs we currently rely upon. 3.5 stars."

The Perfect Predator reads like a Robin Cook or Michael Crichton novel. I like reading books about science. Even more since my great niece was born with Cystic Fibrosis because I want to learn as much as possible about this awful disease. The Perfect Predator is not a Cystic Fibrosis story rather it is the true story of what happens when an individual becomes infected with a superbug that is multi antibiotic resistant. Catching a superbug can happen to anyone and many of these bugs have become resistant to all antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics because for years antibiotics were prescribed by doctors frequently and were present in the meat we ate. The husband in the book had one of these superbugs, and the book is the tale of his wife and a team of physicians and researchers who turned to an almost forgotten method - phage therapy to try to save him. Phage therapy is a breakthrough treatment for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis who often contract superbug lung infections that have stopped responding to antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. While phage therapy can’t cure Cystic Fibrosis, it maybe able to halt the superbug lung infections that kill some of those with CF. Well written for a target audience of nonscientists.

As a bacteriophage (phage) researcher, I was delighted to receive an advanced copy of this gripping tale of the therapeutic application of phages for treating Tom Patterson. The science bits are simple and nicely explained, and won't prevent you from turning page after page. The collaborative nature of the scientists and doctors involved is inspiring, all working to try and save one person's life whom they don't know. They rolled the dice in a high stakes game and won. Tom Patterson's case illustrates the challenges presented with antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens (bad bugs), and brings it home at a personal level. But hope is not lost, and this well-told tale restores our faith in a vigorous and creative scientific community as a reservoir of new solutions to major health challenges."

At least we can hope it will be the day for that. This is the second time I have been surprised to come to understand how scientific research and thought paths can be altered--ruinously--by racial or geo-social political prejudices. The Germans understood the relationship of fat and carbohydrates to weight gain, but because the Germans were our enemies in two world wars, the U.S. turned its back on all of that research. And then here again: the Soviets were diving deeper into phage research and so the U.S. turned its back on all of that--maybe not quite that obviously or simplistically in either case, but definitely the prejudices had an impact. It might not be as great an impact if the giant funding mechanism for scientific research in the U.S. was not our government.Anyway, I enjoyed this book very much, appreciate that my friend Donna recommended to me, and appreciate also that she understood when I told her the link to travel that complicated the author's husband's health crisis makes this a book I cannot let my husband read--unless I want to never travel again!

Stef seeks out non-traditional therapies and proposes phage, viruses that infect bacteria. Approximately 100 years ago, phage were researched for human use.

That’s how some of the world’s top health officials, including former CDC director Tom Frieden, describe the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). By 2050, one person could die from a superbug infection every three seconds, making AMR a more immediate threat to humankind than climate change."""
20,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15720140-booksingarden,5,"Fantastic book by a scientist, epidemiologist, on her efforts to find a cure for her husband who had his entire body colonized by superbugs and been in a coma for months. With immediate multiple organ failure imminent, she investigated phage/bacteriophage therapy. She working in conjunction with others eventually managed to get enough phage varieties (wrong word) to successfully knock out the primary villain (Acinetobacter baumannii)."
21,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson,5,"This is an unputdownable true medical thriller and I loved it. I usually only find 1 or 2 books a year that I absolutely can't put down and this was definitely one of them; I read the entire book in less than 24 hours (rare!). Steffanie Strathdee and her husband Tom Patterson were traveling in Egypt when Tom first got violently sick. Eventually they figured out that he had contracted an infection from a superbug - a virulent drug-resistant bacteria. When Tom worsened and worsened and doctors started to tell her that there was nothing more that could be done, epidemiologist Steffanie took matters into her own hands, researching phage therapy - treatment involving virus phages that attack bacteria. Not only is this a page-turning thriller that reads like the best episode of ER ever, it's written in a very relateable style and with lots of humorous moments. I enjoyed the writing as much as the subject matter. Strathdee has a talent for explaining a lot of complicated medical stuff in ways that make it easy to understand and engage with. I learned a ton and super enjoyed the reading experience. It's definitely disturbing in parts and this book won't be for everybody - it's graphic in its descriptions of Tom's illness, hypochondriacs and the squeamish should stay away. Plus, the threat of drug-resistant bacteria is a very real threat that humans have created and ignored for so long that it's pretty scary. Press this into the hands of readers who enjoyed true medical mystery stories like BRAIN ON FIRE or THE HOT ZONE. "
22,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472316-zulfiya,3,"On a personal level, it is one of the most conflicted reviews I am posting. Let me first elaborate the positive aspects of my reading experience. 1. The book flows, and it flows well, and all the parts in it are in the right places, and nothing is excessive in the book, and chapters do not drag. 2. The book is bringing awareness to antibiotic resistant bacteria strains, and it serves its educational purpose. 3. The writing per se ( sentences, paragraphs, transitions - aka the building blocks of composition) was good,too. It was not spectacular, and it is hard to achieve deep emotional engagement with non-fiction, but it was very decent and relatable. 4. it was based on personal experience, and it always takes some guts to publish a book with the personal involvement, including some very intimate moments about bodily functions. Now, my peeves, and many of them are subjective peeves driven by my Russian judgmental nature and my personal freelancing experience as an interpreter/translator working in the field of public health, HIV, ID, and epidemiology. It is also important to keep in mind that my degree is in ESL, linguistics, and world lit. 1. I was only exposed to this field as an interpreter, but some of moments of ignorance shocked me. Again, it is all my vitriolic Russian nature is rearing its ugly head. In Russia, once can not be an epidemiologist without taking extensive courses of infectious diseases, and vice versa, one can not be an infectious disease specialist and being totally clueless about public health and ways diseases spread. One can say that global public health is mostly WHO protocols, predictions and formulas, and it is true, but these formulas without any knowledge how diseases spread and their etiology are useless, so I simply found this lack of knowledge unbelievable. 2. Again, due to my Russian background, I heard about phages and their usages in microbiology and public health. One might attribute my knowledge to the factors Ms. Strathdee mentioned in her book, but I did hear about the biophage methods in ..... high school. High school!!!! Not college - high school! I can say many negative things about the Soviets, but formal and natural sciences were strictly science driven, rigorous, and demanding parts of curriculum. 3. Because the book is based on true events, I also think I have the right to touch upon memoir-like parts of the book. The author was absolutely right to describe the abject medical conditions in Egypt, but in my personal experience, I did visit some rural health departments in the USA, and they are as shoddy and poorly equipped as the one in Luxor. Oh, did I hear a little bit of judgment from the author? I did, and I would be opinionated, too, but it is nice to remember that one can find similarly equipped medical offices in the USA. 4. Please, do not let me start on religion and prayers that were malapropos. First, if it is a divine providence for her husband to be saved, why would phage biotechnology be used only by the Soviets, the self-proclaimed atheists of the past? Secondly, the role of prayers is highly hyperbolic. I do understand that faith is a crutch that one needs and it is an evolutionary mechanism to cope with enormous pressure, but why wouldn't a scientist put common sense first? This is way beyond my comprehension. On the other hand, I might succumb to the same need of succor and support at the time of trial. Who knows? 5. I am sure I will get a lot of hate comments here, but this book had this weird California aftertaste - one that combines science, gaps in required knowledge, prayers, New Age life coaches, etc. If I based my review on my peeves, I would possibly give it two stars, but because it might educate public that needs this knowledge, the book gets a three-star review."
23,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230503-marsha,5,"The Perfect Predator: A Scientist's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug by Steffanie Strathdee and Thomas Patterson (with Teresa Barker) is an all consuming medical memoir that reads like a thriller.Steff and Tom are both scientists. While on holiday in Egypt, Tom suddenly becomes deathly ill. He's initially treated at the hospital in Luxor, then flown to Frankfurt, then finally to the US. Unfortunately he has an antibiotic resistant superbug among other horrible things and his health continues to decline precipitously despite the best medical treatment possible. Out of sheer desperation, Steff, an epidemiologist, begins researching far and wide for anything that could remotely save her husband, but it's a race against time as his health gets worse day after day. I don't want to give the whole book away but let me suffice it to say that I was most impressed with Steff and Tom in their devotion to each other, their sense of adventure, their generosity, their intelligence and their doggedness. Steff grew up in Toronto and was a bullied nerdy girl who even got set on fire once by her classmates as a prank. She ducked and rolled, putting out the fire, then calmly walked home even though most of her hair had been burned away. That anecdote is emblematic of what a smart and tough cookie Steph is. She doesn't give up and she doesn't let emotions get in the way of sound decision making. The way she saved her husband's life is now saving other lives around the world. You've GOT to read this book. Brilliant and heartbreaking on so many levels."
24,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90309560-jill-mitchell,5,"This is such an amazing read!! I knew what happened in this riveting memoir (Steffanie is my sister), but I couldn't put the book down!! Steffanie has a way of bringing the reader along with her on the roller coaster that she lived through. Tom's hallucinations were haunting and captivating. This book has it all, a thrilling true story from start to finish. I promise you won't regret reading this book!!!"
25,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95856766-victoria,5,"This was, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read this year! Ever since I was an undergraduate biology major I've been interested in phage therapy and its potential. This book had me on the edge of my seat wanting to read more and more to find out how it would all play out! The authors did a fantastic job accurately explaining the science behind everything so that any reader will be able to understand the complexities of the problem and the reason why phage therapy is so exciting. I was constantly torn between wanting to read as fast as I could to find out the ending and wanting to slow down to savor the story. A phenomenal memoir!"
26,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92821298-charles-berry,5,The excitement of this book was not lessened by the fact that I already knew the storyline from having watched the authors struggling through Tom's illness. The action was blended with enough science to explain why medical treatments failed and why getting the treatment that did save Tom ready to use required lots of experts and some lucky stars. You do not need to be a scientist to read and enjoy it.
27,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13138777-jason-keane,5,"Brilliant book. Even when faced with the impossible, see what you can do."
28,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35283416-lauren,5,This was an excellent book. One of the best I've all year. Highly recommended for anyone.
29,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925847-karen,4,"I suspect some may not appreciate how important this story is! Since many alive today, including physicians, have not lived in a time preantibiotics or yet appreciate a coming time of “post antibiotics “ we may not appreciate the danger of multi antibiotic resistance. Most of us have lived in a time of easy access to antibiotics to treat any and all infections. Unfortunately we have abused these medications because we did not appreciate the rapidity of the development of resistance possible with the use of them. We have been in a free for all, where antibiotics have been used for any little sniffle or scratchy throat, resistant to the admonishment that most of these are caused by viruses, untouched by antibiotics! Alexander Flemming, who discovered penicillin, warned about the development of this resistance. His warnings fell on deaf ears. So, as bacteria developed resistance the scientific community found new antibiotics and for awhile kept ahead of infectious agents. But now add in the agricultural community which learned that adding antibiotics to animal feed increased growth, which increased yields. Now, uncontrolled use skyrocketed around the world, and resistance grew exponentially. In addition, countries around the world began offering antibiotics over the counter. No questions asked. No control at all. Well, you might then understand why we are seeing the rise of multi antibiotic resistance and the danger this poses. These superbugs are now responsible for an increasing numbers of deaths, as antibiotic development has not kept up with the mutations.This book tells the frightening story of a UCSD professor who developed an infection while overseas. The superbug he was infected with proved to be resistant to every single antibiotic available, including those usually kept in reserve for resistant infections. As he became sicker and sicker, and was medivaked to first Germany and then to the UCSD hospital, he seemed to be in very serious danger of losing his life. His wife, also a UCSD professor of infectious disease epidemiology, desperately searched for some other way to fight the infection that seemed poised to end his life. The plan that she developed, along with a cadre of very dedicated doctors and researchers, was to pluck an old therapy abandoned almost a century ago, out of obscurity. This approach, involved using a virus, called a bacteriophage. These viruses attack and destroy bacteria! The approach was all but abandoned when antibiotics were discovered. The story as it unfolds is a page turner, as they must find phages that are specific for the superbug that was killing her husband and fellow professor. As they raced to overcome each obstacle I found myself unable to put the book down, reading late into the night.This is a book that should be widely read so all recognize the dangers in antibiotic overuse. Also, For those who appreciate public health and epidemiology concerns, and who have enjoyed reading such books as “The Coming Plague” by Laurie Garrett and appreciate the scientific process as it unfolds, you will find this a great read. But, you are forewarned! This is a world we are all walking into, where a simple cut may land you in the fight is your life!“Gentleman, it is the microbes who will have the last word.”Attributed to Louis Pasteur“The thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism,” he wrote, after he and his colleagues received the Nobel Prize that year. It fell on deaf ears among industry, physicians, patients, and policy makers.” Alexander Flemming"
30,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7576034-celena,5,Fascinating!
31,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8140239-dylan,5,"Best nonfiction book I've read so far. Fascinating, gripping, tearjerking, fierce, inspirational, touching, raw, blunt, hopeful, grim, striking, spiritual, unvarnished, human, on the shoulders of giants.I hope that phage therapy will indeed become a viable therapy next to antibiotics and other potential future treatments like quorum sensing inhibitors, bacteriocenes, antimicrobial peptides and others. It'll be crucial to not just insist on antibiotic stewardship, but phage stewardship and stewardship of all antimicrobial medicines to prevent the emergence of new multi resistances as much as possible."
32,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35512436-gillian,5,"I blew through this book. Its a very easy read -part thriller, part medical. The science on phage biology in it is kept light but references are given. The book places more emphasis on the clinical approaches and how conventional treatments were tried and failed. It's also a very interesting story of persistence and belief, as well as a highlight of the innovation which can happen when different research groups, and entities, including the FDA work together towards solutions. I was particularly interested in the reasons why phage research hadn't come further in the West.Highly recommended for your summer reading."
33,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2498102-leanne,5," I don't think I would have ventured near this gem of a book without reading the recommendation of it on my Goodreads feed--so thanks, Mary!This is the true story of a scientist's fight to save her husband from an antibiotic-resistant ""superbug,"" and the most surprising thing to me is that Strathdee is able to tell a very complex, scientific experience in a way that keeps a non-scientist like me totally engaged. My doctor husband loved it too. I highly recommend it both for the great storytelling and for the medical-world insights. "
34,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13295653-nicole,5,"Absolutely FASCINATING. This memoir is a MUST READ. As I sit here searching for the “right” words I am utterly captivated by the perseverance of Stephanie and Thomas and their insight to phage therapy. Is it too much to wish I could uproot my family, immerse myself in science and move to San Diego to study. Not even kidding, sorta. This memoir is that thrilling. Wait...Is it too late to join the Navy? (Read this book!) Haha!Stephanie, Thomas and the many forces behind them (too many to name here) are heroes to the world. If only the world would follow suit.

36,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5223975-pam,4,"This was a book I hated to put down. Having a bit of a medical background gave me insight to what was going on for this unfortunate man who picked up the worst superbug ever. Enter Phage treatment. I’d never heard of it but am quite excited by it. The process of months of treatments, the emotional roller coaster, the bits of humour all contributed to a good book. "

40,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7712419-liz,4,What a horrible (but fascinating!) ordeal for the author and her family to have gone through. I hope that phage therapy finds its way into first-line therapeutic options for the treatment of drug-resistant infections (and maybe infections generally). This book is engagingly written and thoroughly interesting. Recommended if you like fast-paced epidemiological thrillers.

I saw the authors on BookTV, and their story was so compelling that I wanted to read the book. The wife searches for a cure to her husband's infection of a bacteria resistant to all antibiotics. Amazing. Frightening. Enlightening."
44,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76894477-karen-roos,5,"A non-fiction book that combines science, romance, high adventure, utter terror, life and death drama, AND has a happy ending, is a rare find. This was a highly engaging tale that also painlessly taught me a little science while I was engrossed in the overall story. You need this book!"
45,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010080-shani,5,"If you are fascinated by epidemiology like I am, read this book, it's incredible. If not, pick a different genre. This will likely not be the one for you."
46,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15716216-carol-creech,5,"I couldn't put this one down. I read very sporadically these days, but this amazing account is a gripping combination of science, tenacity, and serendipity all rolled into one. Though the end result is clear from the dust jacket, you are taken on the roller-coaster of this horrifying experience right alongside Dr. Strathdee, and I wanted to follow every step along the way to see how they accomplished it. Even more exciting is to see where Dr. Strathdee and Dr. Schooley (her friend and colleague who helped save her husband's life) are taking what they learned to help others fighting the ever-growing, modern-day plague of antibiotic resistant bacteria."
47,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91406897-joseph-de,5,"As a friend of the author I was lucky enough to get to read an advanced copy of the book. What seems a magnificent Science Fiction tale is, in fact, a Science fact story, a love story told with humour, desperation and compassion, with serious implications for our world of tomorrow. What The Da Vinci Code was to Christian mythology and classic art The Perfect Predator is to medical science and the deadly antibiotic resistance epidemic this world faces today. Dr. Strathdee’s poignant tale relives the despair of powerlessness through to the hope and determination of her research, all the way to success in saving the love of her life. A wonderful and touching book."

49,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104909046-madison,5,I loved this book!! I had a feeling I would though as it’s closely related to the research I’m involved in. It had the perfect amount of story line mixed with education and public health history to all balance our beautifully. It offered great insight into where the world currently stands in the fight against antibiotic resistance and where we are headed in the future. You will find yourself rooting for Tom with every twist and turn of his care in different settings across the world. This book is excellent for scientifically minded people and I’ve already recommended it to colleagues. The Perfect Predator is a must read.

51,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54696048-yolanda-wallington,5,"I absolutely loved this scientific read with such an amazing personal story. As a registered nurse, the science and the terminology were familiar to me. I think that the author did an adequate job describing principals & procedures and defining terms, however I am not sure that a lay person wouldn't miss important points of the book. The most important point, however, is that the author has a determination to save her dying husband and the language used to describe this is universal. I would read this again. "
52,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37939833-blaire-benson,4,"This is a medical drama of the highest caliber. Trouble is....it's all true! Over-prescribing of antibiotics has led to some really nasty superbugs. When a world-class doctors cannot find a single antibiotic to clear up a deadly infection, what do you do? You invite viruses over to play, of course! I love the use of bacteriophages to combat deadly resistant bacteria in a human host. What an amazing world we live in! This book is science and medicine at its best! Knowing the ending doesn't even dampen the twists and turns of this case. Wonderful nonfiction, medical read."

It was fascinating to learn about the phage therapy which brought her husband from the brink of death. Tom's interludes gave great insight into what it was like for him while in a coma. Antibiotic resistance is a problem which needs to be addressed.

55,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38895582-clay,2,"Two people go looking for trouble in the world of bacteria and find it. Absolutely astounded by the stupidity her husband shows in protecting himself from infection over the course of his lifetime and their lackadaisical use of antibiotics during trips abroad especially considering the author has a PhD in Epidemiology. How did it take this episode for the author, an epidemiologist, to become aware of the massive threat that antibiotic resistant bacteria poses to humanity? She even admits how shocking her ignorance was at the end of the book.There is an immense amount of filler. Be prepared to learn plenty about Steffanie's Pandora playlists, her son's Pokemon cards, and her skype psychic that she consults with in a 100% serious manner throughout the book. This is rarely a book about science and when it is it's devoid of technical details or sufficient context--mostly it's just history. You can tell that Steffanie would rather have written a fiction novel and considering the amount of stress she was under during her husband's hospitalization I wouldn't be surprised if a large portion of the interactions and characters in this book were completely manufactured. She was most likely suffering from serious sleep deprivation and stress considering her mentioning getting PTSD yet still has pages long conversations with exact quotes from strangers and friends alike. Steffanie at the very least gives a good idea of past phage treatments, what they are, and where they're going."
56,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82267638-sondra-brooks,4,"For those of you who like memoir, and for those of you who like science, THIS IS THE BOOK! I had never before heard of phages---viruses that eat bacteria--- and this was fascinating instruction on the subject. The author saved her husband's life through her own intelligence, quick-thinking, and courage. Time was running out, traditional treatment options had failed, and the author had the nerve to ask doctors to try it her way. I have to hand it to the doctors as well for not brushing her off.I was grateful that the book didn't morph into pleas to a god, or sappy theology, or a morass of thoughts and prayers. No, it was SCIENCE, and a fascinating lesson at that.. I don't think we can be warned often enough about the risks of taking antibiotics, especially at the slightest sign of infection. For those of you who eat meat, please be very careful about its source; antibiotics may have been injected into the animal. I was reminded while reading this book that antibiotics are even prescribed for my dogs, and seemingly far too often. ""The Perfect Predator"" is a source of very good information, and on many levels."
57,0316418080,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"A somewhat engaging account of an infectious disease epidemiologist’s efforts, along with those of two separate labs and a whole host of other doctors and supporters, to save the life of her husband after a pancreatic pseudocyst becomes contaminated with a superbug.The human interest angle is meant to bring in the non-scientist public, and the account is sprinkled with explanations of the history of epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and basic microbiology, so it remains accessible even as Strathdee and the team head for the edges of modern medicine. More interesting to me was the bureaucratic process Strathdee has to vault in order to get permission to use phage therapy on her dying husband. She succeeds, but to the informed observer it’s easy to see where someone who wasn’t a well-respected member of the infectious disease and academic community may have faltered or been roadblocked.A good epilogue on the current status of phage therapy (rapidly expanding) and good points about medical research, successful and otherwise."

Through a perfect blend of personal statement, factual recitation, scientific review, and ""interludes"" by her then-comatose (or nearly so) husband, Strathdee builds a story that educates, horrifies, and enlightens in turn. It was a powerful and moving read and hopefully will serve as a wake-up call about the dangers of ignoring the ever-growing evidence about the dangers of ""superbugs""...Thanks to NetGalley for my review copy."

What turned me off were the constant weird New Age-y references and the continued story of Tom’s “Cherokee grandfather”. These family narratives of an ancestor who is said to be Native American are extremely harmful and the way they included it in this book perpetuated stereotypes about Natives. The descriptions of “shamanic drums” almost made me quit the book. Obviously this book was written from a position of privilege. "

Fascinating, gripping, tearjerking, fierce, inspirational, touching, raw, blunt, hopeful, grim, striking, spiritual, unvarnished, human, on the shoulders of giants.I hope that phage therapy will indeed become a viable therapy next to antibiotics and other potential future treatments like quorum sensing inhibitors, bacteriocenes, antimicrobial peptides and others.

She succeeds, but to the informed observer it’s easy to see where someone who wasn’t a well-respected member of the infectious disease and academic community may have faltered or been roadblocked.A good epilogue on the current status of phage therapy (rapidly expanding) and good points about medical research, successful and otherwise."

Through a perfect blend of personal statement, factual recitation, scientific review, and ""interludes"" by her then-comatose (or nearly so) husband, Strathdee builds a story that educates, horrifies, and enlightens in turn. It was a powerful and moving read and hopefully will serve as a wake-up call about the dangers of ignoring the ever-growing evidence about the dangers of ""superbugs""...Thanks to NetGalley for my review copy."

What turned me off were the constant weird New Age-y references and the continued story of Tom’s “Cherokee grandfather”. These family narratives of an ancestor who is said to be Native American are extremely harmful and the way they included it in this book perpetuated stereotypes about Natives. The descriptions of “shamanic drums” almost made me quit the book. Obviously this book was written from a position of privilege. "
