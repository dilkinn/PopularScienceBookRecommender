It's an emotional journey with the author as she tells of her frantic efforts to save her husband's life by finding the ""perfect predator"" capable of knocking out ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" She does so my mobilizing her circle of medical and scientist friends to search for bacteriophages capable of doing what all known antibiotic drugs had failed to do.  Her husband had been hospitalized for several months with an infection, and his medical condition had continued to deteriorate as he was put on life support, had experienced repeated bouts of septic shock, and was beginning to show signs of multiple organ failure. Up to fifteen different antibiotic drugs had been administered in various combinations, but any early signs of effectiveness had faded as the drug resistant 
acinetobacter baumannii
 had apparently continued to mutate into increases resistance to the drugs. The author is a research epidemiologist and therefore had the knowledge and contacts to get the ball rolling. Phage therapy is not approved by the FDA, so the use of such unorthodox treatment had to receive permission under investigational new drug (IND) (a.k.a. compassionate use) provisions of federal law. A lot of potential red tape was passed through swiftly—having the staff at UCSD behind it helped.The story begins innocently enough while the author and her husband were vacationing in Egypt. He got sick with what they at first assumed to be an old-world version of ""Montezuma's Revenge."" But things got worse so they were medevaced to Frankfurt, Germany where the infection was cultured and identified as ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" Then they were medevaced to UCSD hospital in California. The next four months were filled with a series of efforts to bring the infection and related complications under control. I as a reader (a.k.a. audio listener) was emotionally pulled along with the author's story as she told of multiple ups and downs of her husband's medical condition. The book also contains multiple short interludes in her husband's first person voice describing some of the hallucinations he had while drifting in and out of consciousness. I finally breathed a sigh of relief as the first signs of recovery were described following initial phage therapy. But that relief was shattered as the author told of another set back due to various complications. I lost track of the number of emotional ups and downs encountered in this story. I was surprise by my own adrenaline spiked responses to the book's story because I already knew the final outcome—her husband survives. Even after reaching the part of the book where the infection is finally defeated the reader is informed of the reality of a slow and drawn out recovery time. The total hospitalization time was nine months, and they anticipate the recovery time to be five times longer than that. Symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) from the long exposure to intensive care are also described.The book's narrative also provides historical background to the developments of germ theory and early utilization of bacterial phages prior to the discovery of penicillin. We learn how the success of antibiotic drugs left phage therapy largely forgotten in the Western world, but it continued to be used in the Soviet block countries during the Cold War era. Any interest in phage therapy at one time was an indication that you were a Communist. One of the really good things that has come out of this particular case is the fact that it has been thoroughly documented resulting in an ""IV-phage therapy protocol available globally to help others."" One of the details learned as a consequence of this case is that some phage and antibiotic drug pairs used together can symbiotically increase their mutual effectiveness which raises the possibility of a second life for antimicrobial resistant drugs. Findings such as these help to raise awareness of phage therapy's potential and increases the possibility for future research funding. Increased antimicrobial resistances is sort of like global warming. We know it's coming, we know why it's coming, but we don't stop doing what's causing it. Bacterial infections that have been easily controlled during the second half of the twentieth century will in the future become once again deadly uncontrollable threats. Therefore, the story in this book provides a glimmer of hope for a method of enhanced treatment of infections in the coming brave new world of drug resistant bacteria.If you are expecting the private pharmaceutical industry to develop future phage therapy, you'll probably be disappointed. There's no apparent way to make easy money with phages. They don't lend themselves to broad spectrum use. Nature developed them narrowly focused on a certain bacteria thus they have to be custom cultured for a single bacterial strain. But the good news is that phages can often mutate while on the job in response to mutations by the bacteria which is something antibiotics can't do.Here's a link to a May/June 2018 article from Mother Jones about this case:https://www.motherjones.com/environme...Here's a link to a TED talk by the author, Steffanie Strathdee:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAZU...If you can't take time to read the book, I recommend listening to the TED talk."

It all started with some small gallstones that caused his body to develop a pseudo cyst. And somehow—who knows how—he got infected with Acinetobacter baumannii. This is one nasty bacterium—resistant to EVERY single antibiotic available. Tom was flown first to Germany from Egypt and then to UC San Diego. [Key learning—Buy the medical insurance that includes medivac coverage when traveling abroad.]Strathdee is an epidemiologist focused on infectious diseases. Her husband, Patterson, is an evolutionary sociobiologist. Both had worked previously on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They had a lot of friends within the science community and knew the scientific protocols they would need to follow as they fought to keep Patterson alive until they could find something—anything—that would work to combat the bacteria. So—clearly they enjoyed a privileged situation in their search.What Strathdee stumbled upon was the use of viral phages to attack the bacteria. This is not a new idea. It was first discovered in 1917, but then quickly disregarded with the advent of antibiotics. BUT—using viral phages is tricky business. First, one must find the viral phage that will work against the target bacteria. AND, if the bacteria is one that can transform and counter phage attacks quickly—like A. baumannii; then one needs to find several viral phages that can attack simultaneously. AND, it needs to be isolated, purified and approved by the FDA. This process utilized doctors, the FDA, numerous researchers, and even the US Navy. Patterson was extremely sick for months. He went into sepsis several times and was in a coma waiting for the viral phages to become ready. The good news is that they worked!Now for the bad news, our overuse of antibiotics has led to ‘superbugs’ exhibiting AMR (Anti Microbial Resistance). There have been no new classes of antibiotics developed since the 80s, and there are strong indications that we may be headed toward a post-antibiotic era by 2050. THIS is likely to be more catastrophic to humankind than climate change.Highly recommend this important book!"

3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946544-christopher,5,"When her husband Tom Patterson developed a stomach bug while in Egypt, epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee wasn’t concerned. The pair had traveled the world and suffered far worse than vomiting. However, when Tom’s condition deteriorates further, he’s medavacked back to the United States. Soon, doctors pinpoint his sudden decline to an antibiotic-resistant bacteria— a superbug. As treatment options begin running low, Steffanie begins her own search for a next-to-impossible cure to save her husband.At the core of The Perfect Predator is a thriller. Tom is suffering from an obviously debilitating problem— something that can kill him. The problem is stopping the killer. Yet, like all heart-stopping thrillers, there’s an infinite amount of obstacles standing in the detective’s, or health professional’s, way. That’s partially why what authors Strathdee and Patterson have done in writing this book is so invaluable. Superbugs represent a massive threat to global health, but it can be tricky boiling away the wonky science to something approachable.Steffanie and Tom, through their personal experiences, humanize superbugs, prevention, and the complex process of experimental treatment. Most of the story stems from Steffanie’s perspective as she researches a cure for her husband. She’s determined, inventive, and a skilled researcher— the perfect combination to tackle such a harrowing task. Her frustration is palpable, and provides an insightful look at the treatment process. Hospitals can seem like places where a patient walks in and treatments work like magic, but Steffanie catalogs the difficult behind-the-scenes work that occurs in the worst of circumstances.Yet, her writing goes deeper than the science. Steffanie’s drive is an intense love for her husband. As the story progresses, she explores her relationship more. Though she struggles through FDA regulations, countless journal articles, and tedious laboratory work, she also shines light onto Tom and the life they crafted together. Their bond is heartwarming and the center of this book.It’s gripping, pulse-pounding, and yet the bulk of the action takes place in laboratories and a single hospital room. Tom is confined to a coma through much of his treatment, and he recounts this in several interludes. He explains the hallucinations he experienced and the thoughts he focused on during his months in the ICU. These are some of the most effective moments in the book, as they play against the chaos happening around his hospital bed.Within all of this is both a warning and a call to action. Superbugs are growing in prominence. However, as Steffanie and the amazing assembly of doctors, nurses, researchers, and technicians who supported her husband’s case discovered, there are options. Phage therapy, a process of using specific viruses to attack bacterial infections, proved effective in this case, as well as other. However, it requires broader research and implementation. Steffanie and Tom have done tremendous work in using their personal story as a framework for understanding a necessary treatment. The Perfect Predator does what all great nonfiction books should do. While presenting the truth, it transcends genres— scientific exploration, mystery, thriller, and even romance. And it does it all by exploring an extraordinarily human story.Note: I received a free ARC of this book through NetGalley. "
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22443749-debbie,4,"4.5 starsAn absolutely fascinating and completely compelling read, The Perfect Predator is not one to miss. With a captivating and engaging writing style, the authors kept the pages turning as they described Patterson’s harrowing struggle to survive a superbug, and Strathdee’s dedicated attempts to find the cure.I greatly appreciated the inclusion of the science behind not only the treatments that were used throughout the book, but also related medical terms, discoveries and histories that help to flesh out the scientific and emotional backstory. Though there were a few times where the information got repetitive because Strathdee would reiterate the science behind something not long after she initially explained it, overall it was very well-presented and explained. The repetition helped reinforce the complex science behind phage therapy and wasn’t frequent or obvious enough to be distracting or negatively impact my enjoyment of the book."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90265068-judith-auerbach,5,"This book is, forgive me, a real “phage-turner!” Seriously, it is a compelling read—a gripping, suspenseful medical mystery tour that turns the tide on a therapy—bacteriophage therapy—long dismissed or ignored by the medical establishment. The authors have done a wonderful job weaving together a very personal and scientific story conveyed in the voices of the two protagonists – Dr. Strathdee, the epidemiologist-wife, and Dr. Patterson, the psychologist-husband-patient. (Full disclosure – both authors are colleagues and friends of mine.) The persistent scientific sleuthing of Dr. Strathdee as her husband lay near death in the hospital from systemic infection with one of the worst multi-drug resistant bacteria is punctuated by the remembered hallucinations of Dr. Patterson—a melding of his awareness of what was going on around him with profound philosophical musings. Together, these voices tell a truly remarkable story of love, privilege, resourcefulness, determination, risk-taking, faith, and luck.The lessons from The Perfect Predator are many and related. First, it definitely “takes a village”—in this case, family members, clinicians, researchers, government officials, and even a psychic—but even more so, it “takes a catalyst” to engage all these villagers. That was Dr. Strathdee, who tapped into her own scientific training and professional network, which was vast from her and Dr. Patterson’s global work in HIV/AIDS, to leave no stone unturned—even those that were a bit risky—to save her husband’s life. Second, it also takes technology. Not only medical technology that allowed the phages to be isolated, sanitized, injected, and monitored, but also the cell phones that allowed Dr. Strathdee to communicate with everyone she needed to around the world at any time of day or night, and the Internet, which allowed her to research the medical literature. Whatever qualms we have about the overreach of such technologies, this book makes clear their value.Third, as the authors acknowledge, much of what they were able to do was a result of being in a relatively privileged position – well-connected university professors of means. Their goal is to see phage therapy scaled up sufficiently to make it accessible to people and places with much more constrained resources. Why they care about this is the fourth lesson: Dr. Patterson’s case must be put, as the authors do, in the context of the global growth of superbugs—antibiotic resistant bacteria—which already poses one of the greatest threats to global health. Combatting this threat requires being open to new—or not so new, but marginalized—approaches to prevention and treatment, and being committed to supporting the science that will lead to their discovery and implementation. It may seem hyperbolic, but it is true, to say that the authors have done the world a great service by using their very personal and emotional story—beautifully written—to save lives around the world."

Having gone through Tom's hospital ordeal gave me the courage to hold my Dad in my arms as he died. -Steff""Bravo, Steff and Tom! I knew the whole story of course, since Mom and I were there to help you through it, at least some of the time. But I still couldn't put the book down and read it until the wee hours of the night. Readers will know that Tom lived since they'll see his name on the cover of the book, but this isn't so much a book about the 'what', it's a book about the 'how'. I thought I knew a thing or two about phages and superbugs, but I learned a lot from reading your book. I really loved how accessible you made it for the reader; you're not writing this as Drs. Strathdee and Patterson, but as Steff and Tom. Readers will see you as people, not just scientists, and in a world where there's suddenly so much opposition to science, this book presents real facts in the format of a medical thriller. It reminded me of The Hot Zone. I'm so proud of you!"" -Al Keith"

I followed this story as it unfolded in (almost) real time via social media and had the honor of being asked to read this amazing book in advance of its publication. Despite having observed this ongoing, life-changing, roller coaster experience as it was happening, the book reeled me in and I could not stop reading from the first paragraph. My heart pounded in my chest in some places and tears poured from my eyes in others. One of the greatest lessons of this story is that love may be something we feel, but it is best expressed in action. Oh, and that phages may end up being the answer to antibiotic resistance.In the telling of her story, Dr. Strathdee beautifully melds two perspectives she brought to this experience; she is an overwhelmed human being and life partner, and she is a research scientist. If this story focused only on the science, it would lose the average reader because so many of us would assume it was beyond our comprehension. However, the descriptions of the heroic people, the roles they played, and their personalities, along with the author’s own self-examination along the way and her commitment to save her husband make this a truly accessible saga for every reader. I don’t see how anyone could help but be moved, thoroughly engrossed, and carried effortlessly along on the amazing journey detailed in The Perfect Predator."

It's Stefannie's love to Tom that make this miracle happens, make her going on and on and on without surrender to save her husband from grips of deadly antibiotic-resistance bug. Talking about scientific side of the book it's not the first time I've heard about phage therapy, but this one explains it in so many great details that you basically can see phage attacking the bug. Another good book she mentioned is The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic--and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World - well written and joy to read."

This is about an epidemiologist whose husband, also a scientist, contracted an antibiotic resistant bacteria while they were traveling in Egypt and the extraordinary lengths that she went to to save his life using a rarely used technique in Western medicine called phage therapy. There are times when this broke my heart and made me tear up because I cannot possibly imagine how difficult this was for the both of them, to be so sick and so close to death so far from home. Strathdee covers a lot of topics from the advent of antibiotics, the factors that led to the overprescription of antibiotics, and the geopolitical reasons why phage therapy hasn't been researched in the West. Everything about it, from the medical to the historical was fascinating and it was held up beautifully by their own personal story. There were so many times that I was just in awe at how brilliant humans can be, and while there is a decent argument to be made that we wouldn't have an imminent need for phage therapy without the overuse of antibiotics, I remain amazed at the science behind phage therapy."

Dr. Steffanie Strathdee is an infectious disease epidemiologist and Associate Dean of Global Health Sciences and Harold Simon Professor of Medicine at the University of California San Diego where she co-directs the new Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics. Strathdee has spent most of her career on HIV prevention research in marginalized populations in countries around the world, focusing on injection drug users and sex workers. She is married to Dr. Thomas L. Patterson, Professor of Psychiatry at UC San Diego. They've led HIV prevention research programs along the Mexico-US borders and have conducted many research studies together and separately.The couple were vacationing in Egypt in late 2015 when her husband comes down with a stomach bug. At first, they think Tom has food poisoning, but soon Steffanie realizes there is something far more sinister at play. Tom had contracted one of the most dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world known officially as Acinetobacter baumannii. Nicknamed the Iraqibacter, this simple bacterium is a super germ that plagued wounded soldiers who served in Iraq. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has listed Acinetobacter baumannii as one of the world's six most dangerous, top-priority, drug-resistant microbes.Tom was fighting one of the most dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world. Tom's situation quickly turned critical and he was raced to Germany and then home to California, where he fought for months to beat this deadly bug. All seems lost until Strathdee comes across a hundred-year-old forgotten cure - phage therapy. This involved injecting a bacteria-eating virus into Tom to see if it would kill off the colony of bacteria that was leading to full organ failure.This book provides a terrific background to history and the development of germ theory as well as early use of bacteriophages before the discovery of penicillin. I was shocked to learn that phage therapy is largely ignored in Western countries, but has been continued to be studied and used for major infections in the Soviet bloc countries, including a leading center in Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia in Eastern Europe.Strathdee's commitment to her husband and her descriptions of being a caretaker really hit home for me. To have someone devote themselves entirely to your well-being is something that I unfortunately know something about. Her story and comments about Tom's condition really resonated with me. I am not surprised by the awards she has won or that her commitment to her husband and its results - an IV-phage therapy protocol that can be used globally to help other people with drug-resistant infections - will land her in the history books.Towards the end of this book, Dr. Patterson and Dr. Strathdee dove into medical PTSD a bit and how Tom was traumatized by spending so much time being dangerously sick in the hospital. I've started to see medical PTSD mentioned more for people who have spent time in the hospital or been through ongoing medical traumas. It's a topic that really interests me. I often wonder how Dr. Patterson is recovering and whether or not they'll write about medical PTSD and how it affects patients since it is a topic that gets such little coverage. Either way, I hope he is doing ok and getting stronger every day.The biggest thing on the horizon for humanity, aside from global warning, is increased antimicrobial resistance. If global warming doesn't get us soon, the bugs will. I can't stress the importance of global health centers working together to come up with more options for these deadly bugs. Strathdee has offered us hope with her story of survival and dedication to finding a cure for her husband."

From then on, Tom fights a harrowing fight first in a small clinic in Egypt, then in a much larger hospital in Germany, and onward when he's shipped off to the one of the most competent hospitals in the States.

Strathdee takes a lot of detours to explain in ""normal people"" terms what's going on with Tom medically. But it never felt info-dumpy- in fact, it was all so interesting!As the sickness unfolds, it seems that everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. And though it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the outcome, it didn't stop the story from being gripping and tense. It does dip slightly in the middle part, but the story always picks back up again. I haven't read many medical thrillers, but this genre is definitely going to be more of an interest for me now.

13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"The Perfect Predator: A Scientist's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug is a medical memoir. In the first half of the book, the author Steffanie Strathdee tells how her husband Tom Patterson became sick in a trip to Egypt in 2015, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, later infected with Acinetobacter baumannii that was resistant to every known antibiotic to scientists. A few months later he was in coma, facing multi-organ failure and dying. The second half of book describes the battle to find the ""perfect predator"" to kill the bacteria and save the patient. In short, the perfect predator for the multi-drugs resistance bacteria is bacteriophages, i.e. viruses that feed on the bacteria. It's fascinating to read about the history of bacteriophage therapy. The therapy was discovered in 1915 (before Penicillin), but largely forgotten by the Western world after WII. It was not only because antibiotics were a much better weapon to fight bacteria infections (easier to manufacture, one type of antibiotic kills many types of bacteria), but also for political reasons. For a very long time bacteriophage therapy was only available in Russian and Eastern European countries such as Georgia. The tide is starting to change as multi-drugs resistance bacteria (known as super-bugs) killing more and more people while no new category of antibiotics has been discovered since 1980s. Tom Patterson is the patient zero of the new wave bacteriophage therapy in United States. Today's bacteriophage therapy, even in its experimental stage and a long way from FDA approval, has moved way beyond what its inventor could possibly imagine. It's a high-tech, personalized medicine, in some cases even including gene editing. It was a fungus that gave us penicillin. Now it's time for recruiting viruses. The Darwinian dance is beautiful and serendipitous.Both Stefanie Strathdee and Tom Patterson became bacteriophage therapy advocate afterwards. Today Steffanie Strathdee co-directs The Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics at UC San Diego School of Medicine."

Getting sick on vacation was nothing new to Tom, however, as he often traveled, ate, and lived a bit on the wild side. But when what they thought was food poisoning grew increasingly worse, his wife Steffanie Strathdee took him to a clinic in Luxor. Soon, the humble clinic could do nothing for Tom and he was medivac’d to a state-of-the-art hospital in Germany, where it was determined that he had an infection of Acinetobacter baumannii. Ordinarily a relatively harmless bacteria that resides in our guts, A. baumannii has become a “superbug” - an antibiotic resistant bacteria - and one of the “worst bacteria on the planet.”This is an interesting story about how Strathdee, a global health specialist and epidemiologist, was able to find a controversial and fairly obscure treatment for her husband using bacteriophages, or “phages” for short. Phages are tiny viruses that prey naturally upon bacteria. And while the story of Tom’s illness, which left him in a coma for two months, is fairly compelling in its own right, I felt this alternative treatment was the real story in light of our overuse of antibiotics and their growing resistance. Yet as interesting as the story is, I had a hard time getting into it - not really connecting until I was more than 100 pages in. Still, the story is well-told and you get a decent feeling for what it was like, the ups and downs and the worry and feelings of helplessness. I’m not as enthusiastic about it as most other readers, but I think it’s an important direction for the future as more and more bacteria stop responding to the drugs we currently rely upon. 3.5 stars."

The Perfect Predator reads like a Robin Cook or Michael Crichton novel. I like reading books about science. Even more since my great niece was born with Cystic Fibrosis because I want to learn as much as possible about this awful disease. The Perfect Predator is not a Cystic Fibrosis story rather it is the true story of what happens when an individual becomes infected with a superbug that is multi antibiotic resistant. Catching a superbug can happen to anyone and many of these bugs have become resistant to all antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics because for years antibiotics were prescribed by doctors frequently and were present in the meat we ate. The husband in the book had one of these superbugs, and the book is the tale of his wife and a team of physicians and researchers who turned to an almost forgotten method - phage therapy to try to save him. Phage therapy is a breakthrough treatment for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis who often contract superbug lung infections that have stopped responding to antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. While phage therapy can’t cure Cystic Fibrosis, it maybe able to halt the superbug lung infections that kill some of those with CF. Well written for a target audience of nonscientists.

At least we can hope it will be the day for that. This is the second time I have been surprised to come to understand how scientific research and thought paths can be altered--ruinously--by racial or geo-social political prejudices. The Germans understood the relationship of fat and carbohydrates to weight gain, but because the Germans were our enemies in two world wars, the U.S. turned its back on all of that research. And then here again: the Soviets were diving deeper into phage research and so the U.S. turned its back on all of that--maybe not quite that obviously or simplistically in either case, but definitely the prejudices had an impact. It might not be as great an impact if the giant funding mechanism for scientific research in the U.S. was not our government.Anyway, I enjoyed this book very much, appreciate that my friend Donna recommended to me, and appreciate also that she understood when I told her the link to travel that complicated the author's husband's health crisis makes this a book I cannot let my husband read--unless I want to never travel again!

21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson,5,"This is an unputdownable true medical thriller and I loved it. I usually only find 1 or 2 books a year that I absolutely can't put down and this was definitely one of them; I read the entire book in less than 24 hours (rare!). Steffanie Strathdee and her husband Tom Patterson were traveling in Egypt when Tom first got violently sick. Eventually they figured out that he had contracted an infection from a superbug - a virulent drug-resistant bacteria. When Tom worsened and worsened and doctors started to tell her that there was nothing more that could be done, epidemiologist Steffanie took matters into her own hands, researching phage therapy - treatment involving virus phages that attack bacteria. Not only is this a page-turning thriller that reads like the best episode of ER ever, it's written in a very relateable style and with lots of humorous moments. I enjoyed the writing as much as the subject matter. Strathdee has a talent for explaining a lot of complicated medical stuff in ways that make it easy to understand and engage with. I learned a ton and super enjoyed the reading experience. It's definitely disturbing in parts and this book won't be for everybody - it's graphic in its descriptions of Tom's illness, hypochondriacs and the squeamish should stay away. Plus, the threat of drug-resistant bacteria is a very real threat that humans have created and ignored for so long that it's pretty scary. Press this into the hands of readers who enjoyed true medical mystery stories like BRAIN ON FIRE or THE HOT ZONE. "
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472316-zulfiya,3,"On a personal level, it is one of the most conflicted reviews I am posting. Let me first elaborate the positive aspects of my reading experience. 1. The book flows, and it flows well, and all the parts in it are in the right places, and nothing is excessive in the book, and chapters do not drag. 2. The book is bringing awareness to antibiotic resistant bacteria strains, and it serves its educational purpose. 3. The writing per se ( sentences, paragraphs, transitions - aka the building blocks of composition) was good,too. It was not spectacular, and it is hard to achieve deep emotional engagement with non-fiction, but it was very decent and relatable. 4. it was based on personal experience, and it always takes some guts to publish a book with the personal involvement, including some very intimate moments about bodily functions. Now, my peeves, and many of them are subjective peeves driven by my Russian judgmental nature and my personal freelancing experience as an interpreter/translator working in the field of public health, HIV, ID, and epidemiology. It is also important to keep in mind that my degree is in ESL, linguistics, and world lit. 1. I was only exposed to this field as an interpreter, but some of moments of ignorance shocked me. Again, it is all my vitriolic Russian nature is rearing its ugly head. In Russia, once can not be an epidemiologist without taking extensive courses of infectious diseases, and vice versa, one can not be an infectious disease specialist and being totally clueless about public health and ways diseases spread. One can say that global public health is mostly WHO protocols, predictions and formulas, and it is true, but these formulas without any knowledge how diseases spread and their etiology are useless, so I simply found this lack of knowledge unbelievable. 2. Again, due to my Russian background, I heard about phages and their usages in microbiology and public health. One might attribute my knowledge to the factors Ms. Strathdee mentioned in her book, but I did hear about the biophage methods in ..... high school. High school!!!! Not college - high school! I can say many negative things about the Soviets, but formal and natural sciences were strictly science driven, rigorous, and demanding parts of curriculum. 3. Because the book is based on true events, I also think I have the right to touch upon memoir-like parts of the book. The author was absolutely right to describe the abject medical conditions in Egypt, but in my personal experience, I did visit some rural health departments in the USA, and they are as shoddy and poorly equipped as the one in Luxor. Oh, did I hear a little bit of judgment from the author? I did, and I would be opinionated, too, but it is nice to remember that one can find similarly equipped medical offices in the USA. 4. Please, do not let me start on religion and prayers that were malapropos. First, if it is a divine providence for her husband to be saved, why would phage biotechnology be used only by the Soviets, the self-proclaimed atheists of the past? Secondly, the role of prayers is highly hyperbolic. I do understand that faith is a crutch that one needs and it is an evolutionary mechanism to cope with enormous pressure, but why wouldn't a scientist put common sense first? This is way beyond my comprehension. On the other hand, I might succumb to the same need of succor and support at the time of trial. Who knows? 5. I am sure I will get a lot of hate comments here, but this book had this weird California aftertaste - one that combines science, gaps in required knowledge, prayers, New Age life coaches, etc. If I based my review on my peeves, I would possibly give it two stars, but because it might educate public that needs this knowledge, the book gets a three-star review."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230503-marsha,5,"The Perfect Predator: A Scientist's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug by Steffanie Strathdee and Thomas Patterson (with Teresa Barker) is an all consuming medical memoir that reads like a thriller.Steff and Tom are both scientists. While on holiday in Egypt, Tom suddenly becomes deathly ill. He's initially treated at the hospital in Luxor, then flown to Frankfurt, then finally to the US. Unfortunately he has an antibiotic resistant superbug among other horrible things and his health continues to decline precipitously despite the best medical treatment possible. Out of sheer desperation, Steff, an epidemiologist, begins researching far and wide for anything that could remotely save her husband, but it's a race against time as his health gets worse day after day. I don't want to give the whole book away but let me suffice it to say that I was most impressed with Steff and Tom in their devotion to each other, their sense of adventure, their generosity, their intelligence and their doggedness. Steff grew up in Toronto and was a bullied nerdy girl who even got set on fire once by her classmates as a prank. She ducked and rolled, putting out the fire, then calmly walked home even though most of her hair had been burned away. That anecdote is emblematic of what a smart and tough cookie Steph is. She doesn't give up and she doesn't let emotions get in the way of sound decision making. The way she saved her husband's life is now saving other lives around the world. You've GOT to read this book. Brilliant and heartbreaking on so many levels."

Ever since I was an undergraduate biology major I've been interested in phage therapy and its potential. This book had me on the edge of my seat wanting to read more and more to find out how it would all play out! The authors did a fantastic job accurately explaining the science behind everything so that any reader will be able to understand the complexities of the problem and the reason why phage therapy is so exciting. I was constantly torn between wanting to read as fast as I could to find out the ending and wanting to slow down to savor the story. A phenomenal memoir!"

29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925847-karen,4,"I suspect some may not appreciate how important this story is! Since many alive today, including physicians, have not lived in a time preantibiotics or yet appreciate a coming time of “post antibiotics “ we may not appreciate the danger of multi antibiotic resistance. Most of us have lived in a time of easy access to antibiotics to treat any and all infections. Unfortunately we have abused these medications because we did not appreciate the rapidity of the development of resistance possible with the use of them. We have been in a free for all, where antibiotics have been used for any little sniffle or scratchy throat, resistant to the admonishment that most of these are caused by viruses, untouched by antibiotics! Alexander Flemming, who discovered penicillin, warned about the development of this resistance. His warnings fell on deaf ears. So, as bacteria developed resistance the scientific community found new antibiotics and for awhile kept ahead of infectious agents. But now add in the agricultural community which learned that adding antibiotics to animal feed increased growth, which increased yields. Now, uncontrolled use skyrocketed around the world, and resistance grew exponentially. In addition, countries around the world began offering antibiotics over the counter. No questions asked. No control at all. Well, you might then understand why we are seeing the rise of multi antibiotic resistance and the danger this poses. These superbugs are now responsible for an increasing numbers of deaths, as antibiotic development has not kept up with the mutations.This book tells the frightening story of a UCSD professor who developed an infection while overseas. The superbug he was infected with proved to be resistant to every single antibiotic available, including those usually kept in reserve for resistant infections. As he became sicker and sicker, and was medivaked to first Germany and then to the UCSD hospital, he seemed to be in very serious danger of losing his life. His wife, also a UCSD professor of infectious disease epidemiology, desperately searched for some other way to fight the infection that seemed poised to end his life. The plan that she developed, along with a cadre of very dedicated doctors and researchers, was to pluck an old therapy abandoned almost a century ago, out of obscurity. This approach, involved using a virus, called a bacteriophage. These viruses attack and destroy bacteria! The approach was all but abandoned when antibiotics were discovered. The story as it unfolds is a page turner, as they must find phages that are specific for the superbug that was killing her husband and fellow professor. As they raced to overcome each obstacle I found myself unable to put the book down, reading late into the night.This is a book that should be widely read so all recognize the dangers in antibiotic overuse. Also, For those who appreciate public health and epidemiology concerns, and who have enjoyed reading such books as “The Coming Plague” by Laurie Garrett and appreciate the scientific process as it unfolds, you will find this a great read. But, you are forewarned! This is a world we are all walking into, where a simple cut may land you in the fight is your life!“Gentleman, it is the microbes who will have the last word.”Attributed to Louis Pasteur“The thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism,” he wrote, after he and his colleagues received the Nobel Prize that year. It fell on deaf ears among industry, physicians, patients, and policy makers.” Alexander Flemming"

Fascinating, gripping, tearjerking, fierce, inspirational, touching, raw, blunt, hopeful, grim, striking, spiritual, unvarnished, human, on the shoulders of giants.I hope that phage therapy will indeed become a viable therapy next to antibiotics and other potential future treatments like quorum sensing inhibitors, bacteriocenes, antimicrobial peptides and others.

Absolutely astounded by the stupidity her husband shows in protecting himself from infection over the course of his lifetime and their lackadaisical use of antibiotics during trips abroad especially considering the author has a PhD in Epidemiology. How did it take this episode for the author, an epidemiologist, to become aware of the massive threat that antibiotic resistant bacteria poses to humanity? She even admits how shocking her ignorance was at the end of the book.There is an immense amount of filler. Be prepared to learn plenty about Steffanie's Pandora playlists, her son's Pokemon cards, and her skype psychic that she consults with in a 100% serious manner throughout the book. This is rarely a book about science and when it is it's devoid of technical details or sufficient context--mostly it's just history. You can tell that Steffanie would rather have written a fiction novel and considering the amount of stress she was under during her husband's hospitalization I wouldn't be surprised if a large portion of the interactions and characters in this book were completely manufactured. She was most likely suffering from serious sleep deprivation and stress considering her mentioning getting PTSD yet still has pages long conversations with exact quotes from strangers and friends alike. Steffanie at the very least gives a good idea of past phage treatments, what they are, and where they're going."

The author saved her husband's life through her own intelligence, quick-thinking, and courage. Time was running out, traditional treatment options had failed, and the author had the nerve to ask doctors to try it her way. I have to hand it to the doctors as well for not brushing her off.I was grateful that the book didn't morph into pleas to a god, or sappy theology, or a morass of thoughts and prayers. No, it was SCIENCE, and a fascinating lesson at that.. I don't think we can be warned often enough about the risks of taking antibiotics, especially at the slightest sign of infection. For those of you who eat meat, please be very careful about its source; antibiotics may have been injected into the animal.

More interesting to me was the bureaucratic process Strathdee has to vault in order to get permission to use phage therapy on her dying husband. She succeeds, but to the informed observer it’s easy to see where someone who wasn’t a well-respected member of the infectious disease and academic community may have faltered or been roadblocked.A good epilogue on the current status of phage therapy (rapidly expanding) and good points about medical research, successful and otherwise."

60,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2034447-todd,5,"NOT MY REVIEW:Copying this here because it says everything so well and wanted to save it. Really enjoyed this book.Review is from Clif HostetlerA compelling medical mystery turned thriller race against time and death—this memoir is even more than that. It's an emotional journey with the author as she tells of her frantic efforts to save her husband's life by finding the ""perfect predator"" capable of knocking out ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" She does so my mobilizing her circle of medical and scientist friends to search for bacteriophages capable of doing what all known antibiotic drugs had failed to do.Her husband had been hospitalized for several months with an infection, and his medical condition had continued to deteriorate as he was put on life support, had experienced repeated bouts of septic shock, and was beginning to show signs of multiple organ failure. Up to fifteen different antibiotic drugs had been administered in various combinations, but any early signs of effectiveness had faded as the drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii had apparently continued to mutate into increases resistance to the drugs.The author is a research epidemiologist and therefore had the knowledge and contacts to get the ball rolling. Phage therapy is not approved by the FDA, so the use of such unorthodox treatment had to receive permission under investigational new drug (IND) (a.k.a. compassionate use) provisions of federal law. A lot of potential red tape was passed through swiftly—having the staff at UCSD behind it helped.The story begins innocently enough while the author and her husband were vacationing in Egypt. He got sick with what they at first assumed to be an old-world version of ""Montezuma's Revenge."" But things got worse so they were medevaced to Frankfurt, Germany where the infection was cultured and identified as ""the worst bacteria on the planet."" Then they were medevaced to UCSD hospital in California. The next four months were filled with a series of efforts to bring the infection and related complications under control.I as a reader (a.k.a. audio listener) was emotionally pulled along with the author's story as she told of multiple ups and downs of her husband's medical condition. The book also contains multiple short interludes in her husband's first person voice describing some of the hallucinations he had while drifting in and out of consciousness. I finally breathed a sigh of relief as the first signs of recovery were described following initial phage therapy. But that relief was shattered as the author told of another set back due to various complications. I lost track of the number of emotional ups and downs encountered in this story. I was surprise by my own adrenaline spiked responses to the book's story because I already knew the final outcome—her husband survives.Even after reaching the part of the book where the infection is finally defeated the reader is informed of the reality of a slow and drawn out recovery time. The total hospitalization time was nine months, and they anticipate the recovery time to be five times longer than that. Symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) from the long exposure to intensive care are also described.The book's narrative also provides historical background to the developments of germ theory and early utilization of bacterial phages prior to the discovery of penicillin. We learn how the success of antibiotic drugs left phage therapy largely forgotten in the Western world, but it continued to be used in the Soviet block countries during the Cold War era. Any interest in phage therapy at one time was an indication that you were a Communist.One of the really good things that has come out of this particular case is the fact that it has been thoroughly documented resulting in an ""IV-phage therapy protocol available globally to help others."" One of the details learned as a consequence of this case is that some phage and antibiotic drug pairs used together can symbiotically increase their mutual effectiveness which raises the possibility of a second life for antimicrobial resistant drugs. Findings such as these help to raise awareness of phage therapy's potential and increases the possibility for future research funding.Increased antimicrobial resistances is sort of like global warming. We know it's coming, we know why it's coming, but we don't stop doing what's causing it. Bacterial infections that have been easily controlled during the second half of the twentieth century will in the future become once again deadly uncontrollable threats. Therefore, the story in this book provides a glimmer of hope for a method of enhanced treatment of infections in the coming brave new world of drug resistant bacteria.If you are expecting the private pharmaceutical industry to develop future phage therapy, you'll probably be disappointed. There's no apparent way to make easy money with phages. They don't lend themselves to broad spectrum use. Nature developed them narrowly focused on a certain bacteria thus they have to be custom cultured for a single bacterial strain. But the good news is that phages can often mutate while on the job in response to mutations by the bacteria which is something antibiotics can't do.Here's a link to a May/June 2018 article from Mother Jones about this case:https://www.motherjones.com/environme...Here's a link to a TED talk by the author, Steffanie Strathdee:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbAZU...If you can't take time to read the book, I recommend listening to the TED talk.

A generation ago Acinetobacter baumannii was easily killed by our arsenal of antibiotics, but it has mutated in a Darwinian race against our weapons, and now is immune to all of them. Tom Patterson picked up this bacteria, likely on a vacation in Egypt, and despite everything state-of-the-art medicine could do, ended up in a coma with his organs failing. His wife, epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee, scoured the internet looking for alternative treatments, and came across a few references to phage therapy.Bacteriophages are a specific type of virus that attack bacteria. In the early 1900s a few researchers began investigating their ability to fight infections, but with the advent of antibiotics, phage research went out of vogue. By 2016 when Tom Patterson ended up in the hospital, only a few laboratories in the western world were looking at therapeutic uses for phages (today they are a big part of DNA research, used extensively for gene splicing). But Strathdee, desperate to save her husband, thought this showed promise. She reached out to the three labs she could find experimenting with phage therapy and asked for help. Though none of them were anywhere close to use with humans, since Tom was dying anyway, the FDA approved this Hail Mary pass for ""compassionate"" experimental use. And the race began. There are millions and millions of types of phages out there, and each attacks only certain bacteria. Could these scientists locate, identify, purify, and prepare the right phage cocktail for Tom before he dropped dead? And could the phages kill Acinetobactor before it selected for resistance to them? I am not a science person by any stretch, but I was engrossed by both the war played out on a microscopic level, and the human marathon run by Tom, Steffanie, and the team of doctors and scientists. It's not a spoiler to say that eventually Tom won, and that after a very long recovery he is now back at work. It's exciting to see that his success has led to much more interest in phage therapy, and that several more dying patients have been saved with this experimental method. Those intrepid researchers who kept working with phages despite the widespread poo-poo-ing from the 20th century medical community are now leading the fray into a promising new treatment. As Steffanie told her PhD husband, ""Who knew that your most important contribution to research would happen while you were in a coma!""The scary thing, though? Within two weeks Acinetobactor developed resistance to 7 of the 8 phages in Tom's initial cocktail, and scientists had to go out looking for others. Bacteria are ""smart"" and quick, and evolve faster than we can comprehend. Our casual use of antibiotics, once such miracle drugs, is dooming us. CDC director Tom Frieden warns that by 2050 we may live in a post-antibiotic era, where an antibiotic resistant superbug kills a person every 3 seconds. Within my lifetime we may once again be threatened by a scrape on the knee or cut on a finger. Phage therapy is promising, but no one believes it can compensate if we lose our antibiotic arsenal. That is scary.I really enjoyed this book. My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more science, a bit more extensive discussion on how phages do their work. Granted, Strathdee set out to appeal to a general audience, and this book is classified as memoir rather than science, but I wanted more detail...Anyway, 4 stars."

The ""second time around"" couple who had been married eleven years, were empty nesters with a passion for travel. Between the two of them, they had traveled to over fifty countries. To plan a trip to Egypt over Thanksgiving in 2015 seemed natural. While vacationing Tom came down with what seemed like food poisoning, but quickly turned critical. In an Egyptian clinic, doctors diagnosed pancreatitis, which was found later to be complicated by a football-sized pseudocyst infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria.After two emergency medvac flights, Tom was hospitalized near his home at the UC San Diego medical center. Now Tom was fighting one of the most dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world, and seemed to be losing the battle. After several bouts of septic shock, Tom goes into coma and is placed on a ventilator. There isn't an antibiotic left to treat the bacterial infection and the situation is dire, when Steffanie gears up into professional research mode and pursues the idea that phage therapy could be the solution. She contacts researchers around the world, explains the situation, and asks if they are using phages in their research that could fight the specific bacteria Tom is fighting. Researchers from Texas A&M, and a Navy biomedical center are among the few that step up to help. This is not as easy as it sounds because she also has to go through the FDA for this unapproved treatment.This book is a page-turner and the action is just as heart-stopping as any fictional thriller, perhaps even more so because this is a real life battle. I was totally immersed in the drama of Tom's illness and Steffanie's determination. Most of the story is told through Steffanie's perspective since Tom was out of it or in a coma. There are short interludes of the dreams/hallucinations that Tom experienced while in the coma. In the age of increasing multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections, this case may be singular at first glance, but cases like Tom's will be on the increase. Bacteria are evolving much faster than the development of new antibiotics. Much of this is because of the very real over prescribing and over use of antibiotics.The writing is excellent and clearly presents the story in the sequence of the events as they happened. There is hope and humor in Steffanie's story, as she clearly loves Tom and is devoted to the life they have together. She is also fiercely intelligent. Along with the details of Tom's illness, the history of antibiotics is presented, and her research into phages and how they operate. This is a love story, medical mystery, gripping drama, historical chronicle, and completely captivating true-life story.

Gentlemen, it is the microbes who will have the last word. 
  - attributed to Louis PasteurPerfect Predator is a page-turning, true-life medical thriller. At times I felt like I was reading a Michael Crichton novel. The science is fascinating and scary. Superbugs - bacteria resistant to all existing antibiotics - are becoming more prevalent due to overuse both in medical treatment and as growth enhancers in livestock. Dr. Thomas Patterson contracted what was thought to be the worst superbug, Acinetobacter baumanni. One day, after Tom had been at death's door for two and a half months, his wife, Dr. Steffanie Strathdee, an infectious disease epidemiologist, decided it was time to take matters into her own hands and began searching on the internet for a treatment. What she found turned out to be the ""Perfect Predator"". It involved therapy using bacteriophages - viruses that attack bacteria - to kill the bacteria. Phage therapy had been researched over 100 years ago, but the research was ""relegated to the back burner"" after penicillin was discovered and put on the market. Although it was still being researched for various applications, she could find no evidence that it had been used to treat humans infected with Tom's superbug. She goes on to describe how she consulted and worked with teams of people from various organizations who eventually succeeded in saving Tom's life.Just as compelling as the science in this story is the emotional journey that Steff and Tom went through during the several months Tom was in the hospital. There is a lot of detail about how the family coped during the difficult months when Tom was very sick. The section describing his months of recovery is short in comparison, and I would have enjoyed learning more about that. One thing that struck me was how once the ordeal was over the couple was able to compare notes about the experience. ""Every medical case is lived twice: once in the wards and once in the memory,"" wrote Siddhartha Mkherjee, physician and author, paraphrasing the writer Viet Thanh Nguyen. For a couple or a family, every medical case is lived twice more: alone and together. Each of us had our own version of the illness experience as it affected us individually. Our shared version as a family was a patchwork of pieces that came together more slowly with time and conversations. It was another kind of healing.""I'm sure anyone who has been through a medical catastrophe with a loved one can relate.Because of the success of Tom's case, five other patients were successfully treated with phage therapy by the time the book was published. Also, thanks to generous funding, Tom and Steff have launched a phage center research center. While there is now a glimmer of hope, much research needs to be done before an there is an answer to the dangers of antibiotic resistance. It starts with ending the indiscriminate use of antibiotics."

Here goes...This book is quite brilliant, but many will struggle in the same way that Sheila Watt-Cloutier’s The Right To Be Cold struggled when it was on Canada Read’s a couple of years ago. Both are critical reads, combining the ‘Memoir’ format with timely science… so it might be too ‘science-y’ for some… but not for me!This book is a crash course on so many things including but not limited to: the history of modern medical science; epidemiology; and, the overuse of antibiotics and the rise of (multi-) drug resistant bacteria. It painstakingly documents the broader environmental consequences and implications of our agriculture mode of production, our approach to both health and food policy, and the consequences of government defunding for health related research on human health. It is a damning indictment of our failure to take a multi pronged approach to ‘health and wellness’ in favour of quick and easy - and privately profitable - drug therapies (read ‘antibiotics’) over alternative approaches. And it tackles the global geopolitics of health care, demanding that treatments like phage therapy be part of our western toolkit.It is also a love story that moved me to tears at time. The depth of the relationship between Steffanie and Tom - and their wider extended circle of family and friends and colleagues is profound and moving. Your heart can’t help but go into your throat when Steffanie writes about intimate moments in the TICU, for example a scene which includes this line: I danced for my life. For ours. (pp92-93)It will also speak to - and more importantly, validate - the experience of anyone who has had a family member - or close friend - live through the experience of having a loved one in an ICU unit for a prolonged period of time - and having to advocate and navigate your way through the medical system, as I have had to do more than once.From the uncertainty, the physical and mental exhaustion, to the delerium, to your entire life being on hold… she nails it bang on.On page 126 Steffanie writes that I never knew what a day in the TICU was going to hold… oh so true! It is also a story of hope. Be it watching for the green flash at sunset (p195), or Tom’s survival and return home after the better part of a year in hospital, you finish reading this feeling good about life and about the possibilities for the future....what our experience… shows us is that when scientific advances, masterful medicine, and the will to live come together, that’s when the impossible becomes possible (p311).And for the academic in anyone, the book includes an extensive bibiography and full index at the back."

A major leap forward to saving millions more lives in future, with the expertise learned about phage therapy in its infancy. Much unknown because it’s in infancy today at least in the West due to our easier access to penicillin and to political biases from decades backwards against research in Soviet Block countries, where it's used and better understood. The heroic efforts of so many people involved, from several different conclaves and job descriptions to finally learning sufficient details of what, how much, how often and when. What phage cocktail ingredients had to be changed and tailored to the swiftly evolving microbes, evolving over hours: the circumstances allowing them to beat that race against time to save this man’s life. I didn’t expect to be thrilled while reading this. I raced to read the first 140 pages and then finish it the following day. Little bits of fluffy details occasionally slowed the narrative but it otherwise flowed. I skipped the dozen or so pages where the husband wrote about his dreams—maybe it was important but I wanted to find out what happened next. It was a rather scary look at an archaic, possibly impoverished (2015) Egyptian medical clinic that he was taken to, who treated him erroneously for food poisoning. The clinic staff and police contacts in Egypt: was this business as usual? They were doing their jobs as best they could probably. But I was irritated and incredulous about their medical and cultural ignorance.Look at our own ignorance– will we also look as incompetent 50, 25, even 10 years from now? Will people look back on us the way I looked at these people? Their trip to Egypt in 2015 and the medical drama following for months afterwards –and the many people who were crucial saving him-- inspiring. I don’t think she mentioned the blood donors who allowed him all the transfusions to save him from organ shutdown. We don’t even think of them normally. It's accepted that there will always be adequate for our needs. Our assumptions of our society are that we’ll get the care we need. And hope we don’t go bankrupt for the medical costs. This book was an education about more than just phages. Antibiotic resistance and sepsis: that it is worsening, and that we may not be able to cope in the future: very scary. An estimate that 10M will die yearly from sepsis by 2050. And any infection can cause sepsis, not just antibiotic-resistant ones. A simple cut or scrape may be all it takes to lose a limb or a life. Deadly infections lurk everywhere, and this is even without taking COVID 19 into consideration."

The Perfect Predator is the personal retelling of the rollercoaster medical case of Tom Patterson who contracted the multidrug-resistant bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii. Steffanie Strathdee's memoir retells the agonising months of her husband's illness and the battle to save his life.Steffanie and Tom's story is a tribute to both scientific collaboration and personal determination, as Steffanie faces the reality of Tom's situation as a wife, but also as a scientist. This book contains a great balance of scientific and historical context and touching emotional details of family and friendships. I admire the vulnerability and honesty of Steffanie's writing in admitting her own moments of weakness and mistakes as well as using her and Tom's story to push for much-needed change in attitudes towards antibiotic overuse and alternative treatments. I also loved the inclusion of Tom's interludes, providing the perspective of the patient which is often missing from similar accounts. A common gripe I have read in other reviews refers to the level of detail of particular conversations which realistically could not be accurate. I disagree with these comments in the sense that the thorough coverage and building into a fluid story are essential to what has made this book so well received. Despite this, there are some small areas and moments where the writing begins to stray into what reads like fiction which detracts from the personal and raw aspects of the rest of the book.Another detail I'm torn on is the level of scientific detail. As it stands, this book is perfectly accessible for a general audience to understand the global threat of antibiotic resistance and how it arose. I personally feel some parts were slightly too simplified and would have still been accessible with more accurate and technical explanations, but I acknowledge a personal bias as someone with a background in biological sciences.I hope this story continues to inspire others to do the same as Steffanie, to get ""clued up"" and be active in your own story."

Thomas is struck down with what is iniitally presumed to be nothing more than food poisoning or a stomach bug, little do they know the devastation this illness will wreak on him.From an emergency airlift to Europe follows another emergency airlift to the USA, luckily to the University hospital where many of Steffanie's colleagues are employed. The fight for his life only intensifies there as they realise that they are fighting the most antibiotic resistant bacteria known to man. Only a handful of antibiotics even have a hope of treating it.When it appears that all hope is lost and Thomas is going to lose his fight, Steffanie finds an obscure paper regarding the use of phages for the treatment of these bacteria. Phages are a virus that ""eat"" bacteria but it's not as simple as that. They have to be matched perfectly to the strain of bacteria and the bacteria very quickly become resistant to the virus, the fight begins again.A brilliant, fascinating read and well explained for the lay person. Steffanie does acknowledge their privileged situation with regard to this battle which was one of my thoughts. Thomas had an advocate fighting for him who not only understood all the medical terms but also knew exactly who to reach out to for help. With this in mind she has helped many people access phage therapy and was instrumental in the FDA re-looking phage trials. I knew how dire the predictions of bacterial resistance to antibiotics had been but I had know idea that we are already facing them to this extent. New antibiotics have not been produced since the 80's and without something in our arsenal the situation will only worsen. Thank you to #Netgalley and #Hachette for the ARC of #ThePerfectPredator"

It is a good and tense account of her husband's illness and really a miraculous recovery after being in a coma with imminent organ failure for months. And it could happen to any of us. Which is why should we care. To cure Thomas Patterson (husband) Steffanie Strathdee had to research bacteriophages and those who were working on them at the time. Though bacteriophages had been discovered more than 100 years ago (though not seen as microscopes were not strong enough to do so), and their effects on infections noted, the invention of antibiotics resulted in phage research being pushed aside except for a very few (5? not many more) in all the world pursuing the research if they were able to get funding for something agencies etc thought was really unneeded. However, TP proved to be the perfect storm so to speak (which is nothing anyone should want to be). He contracted bacterial infection, and a couple of others; the first one was immune to any antibiotics we have and the others affected by only one or two. How then to cure them? Phage therapy, the alternate route. Fortunately Steffanie Strathdee was an epidemiologist with medical research friends who knew others to contact; in short a wide-ranging, international ""consortium"" helped out by sending phage solutions to infuse into Thomas. Including also our Navy, which is researching how to combat some of the otherwise almost 100% immune infections our troops have contracted in Iraq.Which means that phage research is now on the rise, and it will help all of us who contract these superbugs--if as Marilyn McKenna says, we can summon the funding and the political will to create it"".

Recommend the Audiobook versionThis was an eye-opening work of nonfiction for me, because I try to keep up with medical news in general, with focus on infectious diseases and MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria. I’ve read about bacteriophages associated with CRISPR-cas9 gene editing system, but like the author, I knew little about phage therapy. Years ago, I read about bacteriophages after finishing Greg Bear’s depressing “Vitals” and a tattered Star Trek TOS paperback about an alien feline species that mentioned bacteriophages. I was fascinated by the medical and laboratory aspects of this novel, but was less enthused about the melodrama of the memoir sections. I was very impressed by the hardworking and near-Herculean efforts of the phage researchers, technicians and everyone involved with—finding, studying, matching, concocting, purifying, titrating, administering—the Navy and Texas A&M phage cocktails. I shuddered for anyone collecting “samples” from sewage treatment plants, cesspits, cattle and pig feces, garbage dumps, and ships’ bilges. I enjoyed reading about the episodes of “luck” and serendipitous events that helped bring phage therapy to the dying patient. BTW, I skipped the creepy interludes from the nearly-dead husband’s POV. The Kindle version was a slow-read for me with a lot of overly-basic (to me) medical information and TICU routines. There were sections that seemed too melodramatic, but when I switched to Audible Audio, the book flowed more smoothly. It’s probably my ‘druthers. OTOH, narrator Christine Lakin did superb work reading the biomedical jargon. Say “Acinetobacter baumannii” three times. 4 stars. Recommend the Audiobook version "

With all of its twists and turns—some events as speed bumps that impede innovation, and others as rocket boosters that propel the experimental treatment forward—it represents the pinnacle of scientific collaboration. Through her writing Strathdee grasps your psyche, and with a firm grip she walks you through the labyrinth that is the Patterson Case. In Strathdee's moments of hysteria, when the reader is left without any hope for Tom, Patterson's Interludes feed that attitude with a strange feeling of love, longing, and courage. Not only do these interludes give us special medical insight, but they make the story real. Beyond nonfiction, and human. It is amazing to see how the smallest biological beings, through a cascade of events, can save a human being from an impossibly deadly infection. This story really shows how the efforts of many, no matter how small, equate to a force much greater than themselves. Equally, through the works of so many scientists and doctors working together, they were able to save a life. Every event which led up to Tom's survival fit perfectly like their own little puzzle pieces, and these were the people who could handle it all. It shouldn't have happened to them, it really shouldn't have, but look at how far we've come because of it—because of Tom. Thank you, Steffanie, for sharing this story to the world. It will inspire thousands and thousands of young women in the future to become scientists like you. And who knows? One of those women might be the one to solve Alzheimer's, or cure cancer!"
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63363454-dai-guerra,5,I love a good virus book and even better if its a non-fiction book because those are scarier. There's nothing like the scare that real viruses cause and especially viruses that are drug-resistant. I've started to listen to my virus books instead of reading the physical book because then I can dwell on each word as I hear them. I find them a lot more fearful and the emotions are stronger if I'm listening to someone tell their story. This book captures both the fear that Tom's wife felt as she watched him battle this drug-resistant bacteria and the lack of understanding and fear that Tom feels as things happen to him. I enjoyed hearing each stage that Tom went through and Steph's battle with this bacteria and her struggle to keep her hope up as she watched her husband at the edge of death. I liked that you were listening to both Tom and Steph's perspective and how differently they both felt about this situation. I thought it was fascinating to hear how these bacteria evolve and how they emerged; I liked thinking about how this story could have gone badly if Steph didn't have the knowledge that she did. It's scary that this can happen to anyone and if you aren't educated on superbugs and don't have the right connections you may not be able to recover. I really love how Steph acknowledges that they had the privilege of the roles they had and in their access to the help they got. I recommend this to those of you who enjoy non-fiction science-related books or those of you who enjoy memoirs. It's a great read for those of you who want some reality to put fear in you or want something to think about.

I was spellbound.The couple travels to Egypt for a historical filled vacation. Several days later, Thomas Patterson falls extremely ill. He is treated in Egypt, then Germany, then flown back to California.With a blended family and many friends, they have much support, but as Tom grows quickly more ill with what is diagnosed as a rare super virus, immune to ALL but two antibiotics, his bodily functions begin shutting down. His wife, Steffanie, searches ceasely on-line, discovers one obscure paper on viruses, and with a close friend, himself a physician, they sail the muddy waters of finding viruses and getting CDC approval.Everyone should read this book because the frightening potential of a world of super bugs without treatment is a very real possibility. What happens when that carry-size bottle of Purell is no longer effective???? We all should be washing our hands for 3-5 minutes many times a day. The grocery cart, the ATM machine, signing with a provided pen, touching any surface outside your home, time in a airplane, sick people who insist on working even when they are contagious...so many ways to pick up germs we breathe in or touch to our face with infected hands. Becoming paranoid won't help, just aware and cautious."

Steffanie and her husband have always traveled the world, fighting the AIDS epidemic and exploring third world countries. They traveled so much that they carried Cipro, ready for the stomach bug that would always eventually attack them. But, this time, her husband gets sick in Egypt and barely makes it out of the country alive. He's transferred once. And again to get back to the States, but he still has an illness that antibiotics can't touch. Guess what? This type of thing happens all the time now in first world countries. Strathdee gives readers tons of scientific information in words we can understand. Phages--I'd never heard of what they did. I still don't know much, but I feel like I've learned enough to want to know more, especially if they help us dumb humans out now and then. Anyone who has had a loved one in ICU or develop sepsis will relate. What are we going to do about it? Have you stopped using antibacterial soap? Do you still ask the dr for antibiotics all the time when you really just need time and patience? What happens when you get sick and antibiotics don't help? How do you act as an advocate to your friends and family when they are in the hospital? Do you research medical journals or just scare yourself on internet discussion boards?

The science is gripping, the personal journeys & nonstop setbacks are heartbreaking. The collaboration across industry, medicine, military, & government blows my mind. I mean, even if you COULD identify a “last chance” treatment and actually get the treatment created in a sterile lab and have a doctor willing to write & get a new protocol approved for dispensing the treatment, what are the chances the FDA is going to approve it before Tom dies?Even though I knew Tom survived, this was a page turner as you follow Tom from Egypt to Germany to California as his condition quickly deteriorates. Biology was not my favorite subject but the authors make the material very understandable.At so many points along the way, the outcome could have been far different; but everything and everyone came together just in time. Time and time again. Strathdee was doggedly persistent & willing to fight to the end (while others were undoubtedly shaking their heads) and Patterson was a fighter. Favorite quote … “no retreat.” "
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4512756-traci,4,"I think everyone should read this book. Not only because it discusses how to be the best advocate for a loved one in the hospital (it does that) but also because it addresses the major issue of antibiotic resistance, how we got here, and what we might be able to do about it (BIG problem, our own overuse/misuse combined with little new research, and honestly, not much...except maybe phage therapy). Having had a loved one in the hospital who suffered sepsis (long, long story) and multi-organ system failure (all part of the sepsis), this was a hard read. It brought back a lot of memories, and yes, many of them were bad ones. I did learn a new term, though, and it explains so much. The author discusses how patients of illnesses that land them in the ICU long-term such as Tom's do suffer from something like PTSD, but it's called PICS - Post-Intensive Care Syndrome. Basically, it's what happens after they regain consciousness, realize what has happened, etc. But the patients aren't the only ones that can suffer from PICS - so can the spouses/loved one that have been through the illness with the patient. It's why even after 10 years if my husband coughs a certain way, or has any sort of symptom that reminds me of his illness, I feel extreme anxiety, even though I know he's fine now. I'm guessing that reading this during the COVID-19 Pandemic didn't help much, either. Overall, a very, very good book. "

With the super bugs and lack of efficient new antibiotic strains to outpace the mutating pathogens, I was thinking we had to find a new way to fight infectious diseases. This booktook me down an old abandoned path that shows great promise for being one new way in our battle of the ‘bacteria. Steffanie writes like a novelist. I loved how she wove international travel adventure, her career and the superbug saga of her family in such a compelling discourse that you almost forgot the story was real! Truth is truly stranger than fiction, and how I love how she wrote about ancient lore, spiritual travel and hard science giving them all equal status, deference and place. As a nurse with a doctorate in cross-cultural care, I was riveted by this couple’s fearlessness and persistence. Sometimes I felt they had not prepared enough for their journeys, and had crossed their own professional boundaries (like how they used a dose of cipro capriciously on trips when they knew how that behavior promoted the proliferation of superbugs).

The fact that the subjects and authors of this book worked in HIV/AIDS also mirrors my experience. This book tells the story of an infection with a multi-drug resistant bacteria. It begins in Egypt, continues in Germany and eventually ends up in San Diego. It chronicles the frantic attempts to clear the infected patient of his infection and the determination of his wife, the author of much of the book, who reads about treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria with bacteriophages, viruses that attract specific bacteria and evolve quickly to combat the evolution of the bacteria’s defenses. Finding just the right bacteriophage isn’t easy, nor is it pleasant, (read to find out why), but the right cocktail of these super predators, or as the title calls them perfect predators, can bring someone back from death’s door. This is a book that should be listened to/ read by anyone who is concerned about drug resistance and the future that may be brighter thanks to phage therapy."

But they were not prepared for this new chapter in their lives: the day Tom fell ill with an inexplicable illness. Thinking it could be food poisoning during their vacation in Egypt, the real fight for Tom’s survival began after blood work revealed that Tom was actually ill with a deadly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria! I feared that a blow-by-blow account of Tom’s illness and Tom’s and Steffanie’s fight for his survival could be a boring read. However, I was surprised that this was a fascinating story, and I could not put the book down. I also feel like I learned a lot about an antibiotic-resistant bacterium and why it is important not to overuse hand sanitizers and antibiotics. I also became fascinated with phage therapy. It was a whole new thing to me! I highly recommend this interesting, exciting and informative book!I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review."

While Steffanie Strathdee and her husband Tom Patterson were vacationing in Egypt, Tom came down with what initially was thought to be a case of food poisoning. The situation quickly escalated as Tom became sicker and it was determined that he had contracted an antibiotic resistant bacteria. As Tom slipped into a coma and his organs began to fail, Steffanie used all of her skill and resources to investigate alternate treatments, eventually finding an over 100 year old therapy that had largely been abandoned by Western science when antibiotics came into the picture. Steffanie and Tom’s story should act as a wake up call for all of us to recognize how severely antibiotic resistance threatens each and every one of us. You don’t need to be a scientist to read this book. While the scientist in me was fascinated with the medical story, this is also very much a personal story of a couple’s journey through a very frightening time but ultimately successful outcome. "

The Perfect Predator is a compelling true story that leaves you eager for the next chapters in phage therapy and the fight against antibiotic resistance. Playing around with phages in the lab to learn molecular techniques has been a fun (if often frustrating) time. Tom's nearly fatal fight for his life, Steffanie's raw grief, and her ferociously dedicated search for a way to save his life has opened my eyes to the real importance and value of phages and phage therapy. The way this book is written plays a huge role in my enjoyment alongside the scientific method & medical investigation that I find fascinating. It is immensely detailed, well paced, and eminently thrilling since after all, Tom's life really was on the line. However, there is a gentle energy woven through the narrative - making scientific progress doesn't erase the trauma of a loved one's prolonged illness.I think everyone, no matter their science background, can understand and enjoy The Perfect Predator."

The truth is often stranger than fiction and even though the book cover lets you know Dr. Patterson survives, the story is a veritable cliff-hanger with the time frames of how Dr. Strathdee manages to bring so many resources to the table (or bedside as it were) over and over again, just in the nick of time! The authors rank up there with Oliver Sacks and Barbara Ehrenreich. Their writing is so personal and intimate, and at times heart-wrenching; other times, it is accessibly educational. As Stephanie learns the clinical science in a field different from her own, she becomes a true detective and advocate for her husband Tom but as a wife suffers the understandable stress and angst of watching her critically ill best friend. They balance their perilous journey in such an amazing book that you won't want to put it down! Even if you think you don't like non-fiction, you should read this one."

It's a very interesting tale of personal agony, the battle, the thin line between life & death & the miracle science can deliver. Beside the heroic personalities involve in this mind boggling ordeal, the take from it are numerous. Penicillin was the first hit we had against bacteria & since then the medical science has traveled with leaps & the things we take granted today are all in jeopardy. Small infections can cause death in matter of no time. The unethical & unchecked use of antibiotics in food chain, has brought us on the brink of another disaster, and that too in about 7 decades. The resistance which bacteria is developing against anti biotic is phenomenal & it requires an urgent need to develop not just ethical practices for the use of anti biotic, but to develop new ways to tackle bacteria.

This is a fascinating and terrifying book written in an easily digestible format. As antibiotic resistance becomes a serious problem in the hospital setting, this book brings home the horrifying prospects of the infections. While this is definitely a story of privilege, it is also the story of a scientist who had the right education and knew the right people and was able to use that knowledge to save her husband and later patients who will also benefit.

That lead to a world-wide journey to find a treatment and involved dozens of doctors, scientists, military personnel, government officials was well as the hundreds of others that would be involved in this story. There is also a good look at the mental strain on those caring for those that can't make decisions for themselves and how difficult it can be to maintain a life balance. One of the interesting parts of this story is the funding issues around research and the communications that must and does take place around the world.

Such an account of it’s like to watch someone you love being overcome by a superbug. How shocking as time passed and one treatment after another failed. I found the science part intriguing, but for any reader it’s a touching account of a couple struggling through a health crisis. Disturbing, yet so hopeful, as phage therapy was reconsidered after being displaced by antibiotics for all these years. These viruses saved her husbands life.Not only does Steffanie have the perspective of a personal account, but she and her husband have devoted their lives to international global health issues.

The endless days in ICU, the medical race to grasp and make family decisions - a heart breaking trail that to many have shared. A true story and a good read and a meaningful book all in one. The PTSD discussion towards the end is an important point to share and one I had not heard named so clearly. What a great example of co-operation across so many social, political and technical lines. It shows quiet strength that these living survivors noted their work on Aids across the american and Mexican border. Doctors still, and hoping to lead by past example.

If the wife hadn't been a scientist herself, I doubt the doctors would have considered and gone ahead with the phage therapy. Personally, I had thought phage therapy for treatment of bacterial infections to be rather common. However, it is still in its early stages and also facing a risk with antimicrobial resistance. Phage therapy also has to be specifically tailored as the pathogenesis of the bacteriophages differ and may not work for different bacterial strains. Nevertheless, it shows to be a promising treatment option and also has a synergistic effect with antibiotics. Some quotes I liked from the book.""The world can collapse around you, but you can survive. Resilience is the sad, strong legacy you carry in your bones.""""When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: You haven't."" - Thomas Edison""There is always hope in life, because there is always hope in science."" - Francoise Barre-SinoussiA thoroughly engaging read. "

The story explores an extraordinary case of the scientific and medical communities coming together to overcome a superbug infection. Steffanie Strathdee very clearly articulates the complex science around antibiotic resistance, bacterial infections, and bacteriophages. This book is anything but a challenging read! The conversational tone makes it feel more human and less academic than one would maybe think given the subject matter. I also think that given the nature of medicine and how slowly things sometimes progress or rebound, Strathdee was able to keep the story fresh and compelling throughout. At no point did it seem fatalistic or beyond the possibility of reason. I think Perfect Predator is an important talking point inside the world of antibiotic resistant superbugs, and our journey to conquering them. "

Such a scary reminder of what we are doing to the biology of our fragile world.Quite honestly tho, my biggest take away was near the end, as the author is describing the after effects of so much time in ICU, including for the caregivers. After spending many hours in the PICU for the 18 months my grandson fought (and eventually lost) his battle with a brain tumor, I never ever thought of how it still affects me, two years later.

It’s always fascinating to me to read what it’s like to be a non-medical person in a medical situation. And, of course, the virus therapy part of this is pretty interesting too, given how we are rapidly approaching a post-antibiotic era. "

I appreciated the depth the author went through to explain everything and I think it's worth a read for everyone, science background or not. I really enjoyed Tom's interludes explaining his hallucinations and dreams throughout the chapters. I knew about antibiotic resistance and that it was a problem, but not to this extent, and it's profoundly affected my attitude going forward in my future career in nursing. I hope that the research field they helped reignite continues to flourish and advance medicine to new levels!"

Knowing that he survived, I was compelled to listen to the whole thing, in order to find out *how.*This is more of a personal story, a story of love, than a scientific one - although it is definitely both. If you, like me, have spent time with a gravely-ill loved one in the ICU, you may find this book to be a difficult and upsetting read at times. For this reason, it took me a long time to finish, even though it was fascinating and compelling. "

However, this story about Tom's superbug infection and Steffanie's almost superhuman efforts to find a cure is so much more than a thriller. Reading about her attempts to bring Valentine's romance into the ICU literally made me laugh out loud and her talks to inspire Tom to fight, when his doctors had run out of treatment options, brought tears to my eyes, even though I already knew the ending. As if this was not enough, this book also educates while it entertains. The authors highlight a looming public health emergency that has already impacted thousands of people and could end up affecting us all. The increase of drug-resistant bacteria and the lack of new, effective antibiotics are terrifying developments. A routine hospital visit, a fall off a bike resulting in a scrape and many, many other everyday situations could land any of us in a situation similar to Tom's. In spite of the complicated science involved, Steffanie describes the technical concepts and issues in a way that's easy to understand, even for a non-scientist and makes a convincing case for research into phage therapy. But even though you are learning about one of the hottest topics in medicine, it never feels like ""class."" You're just right there alongside this awesome couple traveling from the pyramids in Egypt to the ICU in San Diego, leaving no stone unturned as they search for a cure that will save Tom, and that may in the end save thousands of others as well. Personally, I can't wait for the movie."

After finishing this, of course, I saw that the authors had given a talk at my local library back in September '19, only a few months before.

234,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6018681-carolyn,4,"If you keep up with current events as relate to public health, you're probably aware of the presence of ""Superbugs;"" microorganisms that have, through multiple methods, figured out how to best our current arsenal of antibiotics (for bacteria) and antimycotics (for fungi). What you might not be aware of is the depth of this epidemiological nightmare. When the news does pick up on a health-related story, it's usually related to the ongoing opioid crises, the latest controversial product (e.g. e-cigarettes), or, the jackpot of attention-grabbing headlines: Ebola, Zika, or other relatively rare but viscerally scary viral outbreaks. Antibiotic resistance just doesn't seem to capture the popular imagination quite so well.Meanwhile, we are at the precipice of what leading members of the World Health Organization have described as ""a post-antibiotic era."" What does that mean? It means surgery would be essentially out of the question. It makes childbirth an incredibly dangerous proposition, even in the best of circumstances. It means injuries, even minor ones, could result in the loss of life and limb. Based on a combination of societal factors (prophylactic antibiotic use and antibiotic use as growth enhancers in commercial farming, the over-prescription of antibiotics, the irresponsible use and misuse of antibiotics,) and biological factors (genetic drift, spontaneous mutations, gene-sharing plasmids that confer resistance genes to other bacteria, and self-defense mechanisms to inactivate antibiotic drugs,) we are rapidly approaching a full-circle return to a point in medicine predating penicillin and the many life-saving antibiotics that followed. Even the ""biggest guns,"" extremely potent antibiotics that have mostly been kept on the shelf due to their risk of organ, vascular, and/or neurological damage, are proving useless against some of these resistant microbes. This book is written from a very unique perspective. The authors both hail from scientific research and academic backgrounds, with experience in primatology, ornithology, psychology, microbiology, and epidemiology. Both have earned their PhD in addition to racking up decades of field experience, and are well-respected in their fields. And yet, through a cascade of unfortunate events in the wrong place, at the wrong time, they found themselves at the epicenter of a medical nightmare, facing off with one of the most ferocious resistant microbes on the planet. The book presents a balance of both personal and professional perspectives. Dr. Strathdee, who wrote most of the narrative, reveals the vulnerability of being an expert and a spouse in the same horrific scenario. As she mentions a few times, she has a doctorate, but is not an MD/physician, so the clinical aspects of her husband Tom's grueling trip through the medical systems of three different countries were often as frightening and perplexing to her as they would be to any other spouse or relative. As she gains confidence and engages more in the search for an effective way to treat her husband's infection, she shares what she learned in a way that a lay person could understand. She also incorporates several important medical history lessons that provide the reader with background knowledge, like Alexander Fleming's unwitting stumble onto penicillin. Medicine and medical history are two of my favorite non-fiction topics, and I enjoyed this unique book. My only gripe (and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5) was the inclusion of quite a few references to psychic healers, empaths/intuitives, and holistic healers. Granted, everyone has the right to their own beliefs and to cope with so much fear and stress in whatever way they can, but it was just slightly off-putting for me. There's certainly not enough of that to take away from the book's validity overall, especially as it is a memoir and not strictly a scientific text, but it is something to be aware of as a reader. I would still highly recommend the book, and I am interested to see if the authors have any other published works."
235,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5200977-melise,4,"This book tells the story of a man who is struck down by a horrific infection and his wife’s experience gathering together a team of researchers who create an antidote for him. Both the man and his wife are medical researchers at the University of California San Diego. On a vacation to Egypt, the husband contracts an infection caused by a number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. He is hospitalized in Egypt, transferred to another hospital in Germany, and eventually returned home to the UCSD medical center where he eventually goes into a coma and is not expected to live. His wife manages to track down research being done on phages, a type of virus that attacks bacteria. Phages were discovered in the 1800s, but the development of antibiotics led to sidelining research about phages in most of the western world. However, the wife, Dr. Strathdee, manages to gather together a group of researchers who are able to isolate and grow the correct phages to fight her husband’s infection, and convince the FDA to allow his treatment with this untested therapy, which eventually allows him to recover from this infection.I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, it is a fascinating account of the illness and development of a treatment for this seemingly untreatable situation. It is well-written, and reads like a thriller—even though I knew that the husband survived (he is a co-author), I didn’t want to put it down as the tension built throughout the search to develop an antidote in time to save his life.On the other hand, I was reminded of an interaction I had with a friend years ago. We were talking about the book Under the Tuscan Sun, which is a story of a couple who buy a rundown house in Italy and their adventures/experiences as they restore it and begin to treat it as their second home. I remember finding the book charming, but my friend was quite negative about it. She was offended by the lack of acknowledgement within the book of the wealth and privilege that allowed the author to have this experience. A few years ago, this same friend reached out to tell me that her husband had been diagnosed with a brain tumor, an extremely aggressive type with very little chance for survival. She also reached out to her friends and acquaintances and was able to get her husband involved in a cutting edge research study. Unfortunately, the result in his case were not as positive, and he died a few years after he was diagnosed. I find it particularly ironic that the same friend was involved in both of these stories, because after reading this book, I was left feeling much the same way as my friend felt about Under the Tuscan Sun. As fascinating as I found The Perfect Predator, it felt like there was so much missing from the story. I had read about phages in the past, and know that they are used quite a bit in what used to be the Soviet Union. Strathdee mentions research being done there, but never explains why she did not reach out to these people with a history of success using phages. The difficulties she must have faced trying to convince the FDA to allow use of this treatment, and the unknowns about things like dosage and how to administer the treatment felt like they were barely touched on. So, although I definitely enjoyed reading this book, in the end, I was left feeling somewhat disappointed at what I didn’t get to read. Thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for providing an advanced reading copy."
236,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8385692-dindy,5,"Wow! This book so much mirrors my experience over the past several months! The author’s husband, Thomas Patterson, became ill with a bacterial super bug during a vacation in Egypt. The superbug turned out to be antibiotic resistant, and Steffanie Strathdee and Patterson’s medical team were engaged in an almost year long battle trying to fight the rapidly multiplying bacteria that were creating a septic nightmare within Tom’s body. With no more options for antibiotic treatment, Steff, a PhD epidemiologist, resorted to studying treatment options the same way she would approach any other epidemiology problem. She discovered old studies of phage treatment, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. Phage treatment in the US had not been seriously studied for a hundred years since antibiotics came into prominence.So now Steff was in a race against time and bureaucracy. With her husband in a coma and not expected to survive, could she manage to find the right phage therapy for him and cut through the red tape surrounding experimental medical treatment in the US?As I said, this in many ways mirrors my experience over the last several months. I’ve been ill for 10 months with a mysterious condition that left me bedridden for 4 months and put me in a wheelchair, from which I am only just now starting to get out of. Whereas in Patterson’s case, the medical team knew what was wrong, in my case, they don’t. Patterson started out receiving medical care in Egypt which, sadly, was not as good as it could have been. I have been trying to find appropriate medical care in a small southeast Texas town and the standards of care are, sadly, lacking. Tom was airlifted first to a hospital in Berlin and then to one in San Diego. I am going to have to go to a major city for consultation since the doctors where I live don’t seem to be able to get a handle on my situation.Tom underwent something called deconditioning, which is what happens to your body if you are in bed for a long period of time. If he survived, he would have to learn to walk again, and recovery would take more than a year. I underwent deconditioning and spent months in physical therapy relearning how to walk.I could very much relate to what Steff and Tom were going through. The book slowly drew me in and after about halfway, it was hard to put down. I hope they include a cast of characters in the final release of the book. I read an Advance Review Copy, and there are what seem to be hundreds of various doctors and other medical staff who are involved in Tom’s treatment and care. I couldn’t keep track of who they all were and what their role was in the story.This is a riveting book, and I found it very enjoyable, every bit as suspenseful as a Robin Cook novel.Thank you to Hachette Books for providing me with an Advance Review Copy in exchange for an honest rview."

He declined over months and experienced septic shock when his drains get displaced, with the Acinetobacter baumannii (also known as Iraqibacter) spreading to the rest of his body. The physicians indicated that they have run out of treatments. In a desperate attempt to save his life, Strathdee carried out an exhaustive search for alternative therapies finding an approach that uses phages for treatment. Phages are viruses that attack bacteria.Phages and expertise were found at Texas A&M and the Navy's Biological Defense Research Directorate and were screened against Patterson's Acinetobacter baumannii and a few are found that appear to be effective. These were purified, removal of endotoxin being a critical step, and in the end were successful in curing the infection.Felix d'Herelle showed that certain agents were able to pass through fine filters and kill bacteria. He proposed that these were viruses, and named them bacteriophages. He did much work on phages and later in life he collaborated with a Georgian bacteriologist, Giorgi Eliava, who went on in 1926 to establish the first center in the Soviet Union to carry out phage therapy.While twenty new classes of antibiotics were developed between 1940 and 1962, in 2015 there was only a single novel drug under development that could potentially fight Gram-negative bacteria. The misuse of antibiotics, especially in agriculture, has allowed the development of resistance to the current antibiotics.Research on phage therapy did not take place largely because antibiotic treatment was very successful. However, it also appears that the FDA had been very resistant to exploring phages. Even Patterson's treatment required massive amounts of paperwork in spite of the fact that he was a dying man with little to loose.Good book, although somewhat repetitious, with the events being quite drawn out."
239,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930302-michelle,4,"4.5 stars. This was a fascinating book that everyone should read. It shows the real world effects of over-prescribing antibiotics, and what could happen to any of us. I try to avoid antibiotics when I can, and I'm realllly glad that I do that after reading this, but I wish others would too. And I wish doctors would stop prescribing drugs just because patients feel sick and think they need them. And I also think it's high time we outlaw giving antibiotics to animals to make them grow fast and fatter. It is unhealthy for them, and is contributing to the problem. The coming superbug epidemic is our own fault, but there are things we can do to slow it down, and I hope people start paying attention and changing their habits.I honestly believe the only reason Tom survived is because the author worked at the university where he was being treated, had the contacts necessary to push for a novel treatment, and cut through the red-tape. Not everyone will be that lucky.The history behind phages was really interesting. Knowing they have been around forever, but got short shrift because of penicillin was fascinating. Some of the process involved in finding and using them was tough to understand, but it is really useful information and I learned a lot about a tool that I had previously never heard of. On to the book itself. You know going in that Tom survived the superbug, but the writing is so well done that I was nervous for him; it's a real page-turner. I know a lot of people liked his interludes because they show how sick he was and what he thought was really going on, but to be honest, they didn't add anything to the book for me, and I ended up skimming the longer ones. The spiritual guides also turned me off a bit. You do you, but it was a bit much. Those two things are what brought it down to a 4 for me. That said, I highly recommend people read this book."
240,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3927423-hamza,4,"Kurzgesagt's video on bacteriophages was what inspired me to pick this up (in addition to the usual critical Goodreads acclaim, of course).Criticisms first: I hoped that I would get more technical knowledge on the topic from this book, but I didn't really end up learning anything technical about phages that wasn't already covered in that video. The book is also a little inconsistent in the precision of language used - the author is an epidemiologist, and from some of the passages in the book, it's clear that she understands the topic at hand in more depth than she usually lets on. More often than not, the writing uses ELI5-level vocabulary, which seems unnecessary.The above aside, what this book did deliver was an excellent real world history (and present day account) of what real people on the ground were doing and are doing with phages. That alone makes the book stand on its own, but we also get a touching and deeply personal story to tie it together. It ends with a stark warning about AMR, the increasing threat it poses, and the lack of urgency in effecting policy to stop it from governments. In conclusion, it's not without its flaws but this is ultimately both an engaging and educational read."

The story is simultaneously terrifying, heartbreaking, and encouraging. Terrifying, because antibiotics resistance is real and is expected to occur more and more, making us vulnerable to previously harmless bacteria.Heartbreaking, because there were so many setbacks before eventual recovery, which took their toll on gravely ill Dr. TomPatterson, as well as his wife, main author Dr. Steffanie Strathdee, and other people surrounding them.And encouraging, as improvements, however slight, are celebrated. Moreover, as the experimental phage treatment helped Dr. Patterson, it may help others in the future facing similar infections with super bugs.I appreciated the detailed and comprehensible explanations of the medical jargon and the bacteria and viruses playing a role, but focus was on the interactions between Dr. Strathdee, Dr. Patterson, and family, friends, medical professionals, scientists, colleagues... the village it took to beat the disease.All my respect to Dr. Strathdee for her actions at this trying time, advocating for her husband, and putting the process to his recovery in motion.

242,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592686-marian,4,"Interesting, easily digested book that exposed me to new therapy modalities for dealing with antibiotic resistance. Some aspects of the author's story very much surprised me - - - for example, the fact that an epidemiologist does not study physiology puzzles me. The specialization in research, medicine, and science careers may be a big mistake. If there are too many potential units for students to take to expose them to essential disciplines, perhaps postdoctoral work needs to be mandatory. I wonder if the author was really so naïve as to have not been exposed to basic lab values and other medical concepts during her work as an epidemiologist. Overall, the credibility of the story had some holes. Humor in the book may have been honestly expressed, but the author's jokes were unendearing for me. I do like that the author used medical publications to dig up alternatives; too many doctors surrender to using only mainstream modalities. Most of us do not have access to medical libraries and databases, a problem not mentioned in the book. "

Finally he was flown to San Diego where he lived as the hospital in that area had worked with patients whose infections did not respond to antibiotics.

Stephanie, his wife, along with doctor friends searched for experimental treatments. She learned of phage treatment which involves a virus destroying a bacteria.

Acinetobacter baumanii, curriculum vitae, etc. pronunciation made me cringe every time I listened to the narrator. I found myself correcting her every time, which took away from the book.Reading the physical book was much more enjoyable and I found it quite entertaining how Steffanie described the lysis of bacteria as ""phage rage."" It was also quite fun to read of the game and movie references she scattered throughout the book. As a microbiology researcher, I found my scientific thirst not quite quenched, as I wished there was more science content, but at the same time, I understand the need to keep most of that out (I'm sure most readers would be quite bored.).

Truly terrifying info about the ESKAPE superbugs while also giving rise to “evidence-based hope” when it was all said and done, and definitely fascinating potential for a more “personalized” approach to fighting bacteria in a post-antibiotic world. I would have been interested in some additional discussion of the potential moral stickiness surrounding quality of life/death and how long to keep fighting what looks to be a losing battle, as well as a deeper examination of the privilege inherent in this situation (which isn’t meant to be a slam, just an observation of the reality which the author acknowledges herself), but that would have been an entirely different book...so not really a criticism so much as just my personal musings and interests..."

I really doubt that some of the details actually happened, nor do I believe conversations, music, and pet behaviors could have been recalled as precisely as was written).There were a few other “flaws”, or rather things that really struck me. First, the author apparently drinks a lot of wine. Second, she and her husband work for a university that must pay them a LOT more than mine does! Third, she has a personal psychic! While I understand that people will do just about anything to save the life of a loved one, she knew this psychic BEFORE the events described in the book.

He was airlifted to UC San Diego, where doctors determined that he was being attacked by one of the most dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world. Since antibiotics were ineffective, Steff reviewed old and new research into fighting bacteria. She came across phage therapy, the use of specific viruses to kill specific bacteria.

When the authors were actually talking about phages and their uses and history, the book was very good. But while the book should have been hard to put down, the authors instead took too many detours and provided too much information that was only peripheral to the main story. I also found many parts of the book to maudlin. In many respects I have the same issue with this book that I had with “What the Eyes Don't See…” by Mona Hanna-Attisha, where an author’s personal involvement detracts from the story.

I understand you have to write so everyone can understand but the title was deceiving for me, I thought a scientist of epidemiology would at least be familiar with the mode of transmission of Tuberculosis and not have to ask the nurse if another patients droplet precautions were for TB, little things like that were frustrating for me."

Excellent book and kudos to Steffanie Strathdee for her writing style.The bad thing about this book is that it scares you to death and I don’t feel like she makes any long reaching recommendations about how to help! Do we stop eating meat processed from animals who were fed antibiotics? Do we stop using anti bacterial hand soap? Of course we do, but she doesn’t say that in her book. Do we stop taking antibiotics when you start to feel better (apparently that is the new recommendation!) look it up"
252,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3115107-chimezie-ogbuji,3,"It was a well written, page-turning, part memoir and part scientific discussion of superbugs and phage therapy as an alternative to address the rising issue of superbug resistance to antibiotics. Many scientific works of non-fiction don't read very well and spend more time on listing facts than on building a narrative, but this author does a good job of telling a very compelling story. The only criticism I have is that the author sometimes seems to try to put herself at the center of the story rather than her husband the various clinicians and researchers who are really the essence of this incredible story."

More people need to be aware of the urgent threat of super bugs...an immediate & global threat to the human race.Very interesting & engaging book. While I don't work in the medical field, I had a dual major in school which included biology. I also have done some prior reading & research on super bugs. Perhaps because of this, I wanted the book to go into more medical & biological details than it did. However, it makes sense that the book is geared to the average person who doesn't have a biology background & either way, the story is enthralling & well written.The narrator is also perfect for this book."
254,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49907716-nicole-roccas,4,"This book was like the true-crime drama of medicine! Well written, well narrated (I listened to the audio version), and side bonus: I now know more about phage therapy than ever (prior to reading this, I did not know what phages were nor that they are some serious bad a$$ organisms that you definitely want on your team). Mostly gripping, though there were a number of portions where the narrative felt a bit contrived or weirdly paced, trying to get all the story elements in in a coherent way. A great book for med students, physicians, and people who like the show House... Maybe not so good for people who are hypochondriacs and who travel frequently abroad :) It'll give you nightmares. "
255,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46033137-kate-dolan,5,"I found this book a really good read. It was a pleasant mix of medical emergency and science. I pretty much read it in 2 or 3 days, which shows it kept my attention and interest. I knew the outcome but still was keen to read how it came about. I don't know the patient and have met the author only once or twice at conferences, so don't really know her. Its a difficult line to walk and in fact I think she under sold her contribution to the response. I gave it 5 stars and can highly recommend it."
256,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11167984-victoria-zieger,4,"I received this book from a goodreads giveaway. The writing is excellent and the research and accuracy is superb. The author really pours her heart out about what happened to her husband and the lengths she had to go through to save his life. This is both terrifying and eye opening on what we don’t know about bacteria that effects people and kills many. Parts were a bit tough because there was a lot of medical jargon. The author really explained everything well, but certain spots were a bit slow if you aren’t someone who reads a lot about medical issues. Overall, excellent book and story. "

Tom would have appreciated the falcon's familiar presence at his favorite time of day. I was struck by a harsher truth that was oddly reassuring as well. For every prey, there is a predator. In the peregrine's case, with the ability to fly as fast as two hundred miles per hour, it is the perfect predator. Now we were waiting for another perfect predator to do its work."""

Very fast reading, a testimate to love and what it takes to live in the moment...but also shows where dedication and purpose through hard work yields some amazing results. There were moments of brilliant insight coupled with spiritual recognition of the world inside a coma.

260,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88592-claire,4,"Good story, very exciting. I liked the initial depiction of the disease and the battle to save her husband, but it could have maybe been a touch shorter--there were some descriptions of waiting that I could have done without. And I learned to skip the descriptions of dreams and hallucinations. I have yet to find another person's dream truly fascinating, but maybe that's me. Still, the story itself is interesting."
261,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27871349-john-g,3,"An important book whose highlights help the general public to understand biology and the needs for reform. This man's months-long ordeal is re-told as a long-winded diary with too many characters. Naming every team and bureacratic steps defeats both understanding and suspense. Adopting a conversational style doesn't really help us amateurs, not by reporting whatever each doctor says. The phage science is interesting, and its history, but don't explain every agency involved. It felt like Academy Award acceptance speech, thanking every contributor. "
262,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27096169-marie,5,"Very much enjoyed this book. The interludes from Tom were unsettling.I expected more science and less panicked wife in the ICU, to be honest, but I still think it was a good book. The ups and downs were very “page turning” (I was listening to the audiobook, after all). I do wish there had been more of the scientists who helped find the phages, or more from Chip, the doctors and nurses from the TICU, but I guess that’s just me wanting more of the science-y stuff. "
263,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93724249-max-benson,4,"Overall I thought the story was emotional rollercoaster. Many moments of triumph, defeat, happiness, sadness, hopelessness, etc. I had a hard time trying to connect with the author, she didn’t seem like someone I could follow/feel too sorry for. I got the sense that she was overly protective and was “dangerous patient” due to her background in epidemiology. If I could give this book a 3.5/5 I would. I’m glad I finished it, but I’m also glad it’s over haha"
264,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3714699-alicia,5,"I just finished listening to this book. I LOVED it! It is a thriller and a true story. Every though I knew the outcome, I was still on the edge of my seat. I also love how the author wove the history of microbiology into the book. I am starting my 17th year of teaching microbiology and would love to have my students read this sometime too - there is so much I think I could teach them from this book in a fun, engaging way!"
265,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20453695-kelly-white,5,"Great read, my only complaint is that Steffanie did not do more with the obvious fact that her husband only survived because of their socioeconomic status and connections. If Tom had been some ""average Joe"" from the hood or even a middle class family he would have never had a chance.I give Steffanie credit for trying to help others from all walks of life once Tom survived but I wish she would have added more than a single paragraph about the dispartiy of care between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots."""

Would recommend to lots of people who enjoy a good science read that isn't written like a textbook"
268,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4362622-marni,4," The book picks up speed as it goes along. If you find your interest flagging, skim or skip ahead to the second half (in the print version, after the photos), when the phage part starts. The explanations of the science are unusually accessible. (Perhaps that's b/c of the third ""co-writer,"" Teresa Barker, who is listed at the end of the book, but not on the cover or inside flap.)"
