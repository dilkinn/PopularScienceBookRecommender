0,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3089655-bookaddict-la-crimson-femme,2,"This is more a 2.5 star which as people who follow me know, I truncate, not round up. This book started out very riveting. The theory proposed in this book is about the impacts based on the lack of empathy. There were two interesting concepts of Zero Negative and Zero Positive people. Basically Borderline, Psychopaths and Narcissists all fall under the Zero Negative. Different forms of autism falls under the Zero Positive. The ideas in this book are interesting to read. What Mr. Baron-Cohen postulates did make me think. I can see his point regarding the how a person with zero negative and zero positive would behave. His research and theories on why these people became w/o empathy dropped me from a 4 star down to a 3 star. Yes, at the beginning, the first two chapters were very good and had me at a 4 star. At chapter 3 I started to lose interest. This is because he correlates a person with zero negative stemming from how their mother raised them. In each example, it was abuse, neglect, etc from a mother. Where is the father in all of this? Were these children through immaculate conception? This immediately made Mr. Baron-Cohen lose respectability in my eyes. To his point, he does point out it is genetics and a combination of nurture which causes a person to be a zero negative. The examples he chose left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not even a mother. This ""mommy didn't love me enough"" or ""daddy abandoned me"" type of victimized mentality doesn't work for me. Whenever I read this, I consider the writer yet another 1st world privileged philosopher who is only looking at ""1st world"" problems. Is this judgmental? You betcha. I'm tired of people using their parents as excuses for their behaviour. The victim mentality is detrimental because it focuses on how the person is helpless. I'd rather focus on the series of events which shaped a person and for them to be a survivor. Now, Mr. Baron-Cohen did indicate while an abusive or neglectful mother isn't the only variable causing a child to become a psychopath, there was a positive correlation. He does also mention that the tie can't be that strong because otherwise, we'd have more psychopaths running around in the world. However, the book is already tainted for me because his victim theory.Now, there are some concepts in here that are interesting. He explains that it's not that people are evil. It's because their lack of empathy which causes them to behave in manners that don't make sense to the general populace. If people w/o empathy treat the another person as a thing, one can understand how atrocities such as Jew concentration camps and the genocide of Armenians can occur. With this, I agree. That is why the military teaches it's soldiers to call them ""targets"". It removes the humanity of it. Still, this book is running at a 3 star, especially the section on the zero positive. I couldn't stop thinking of the Observers from Fringe when he describes the pattern recognition in the zero positives. The highly functioning abilities of systematizing is fascinating. What was disturbing is seeing how I possibly could have been categorized as a zero positive in my early teens. Chapter 6 is what brought the book down another 1/2 star. While it is nice to think every person can be ""rehabilitated"" with the single flower nurtured in the desert analogy, it's a fantasy. Here's the problem, in order for rehabilitation, the person must want to rehabilitate. I don't believe people want to change. In fact, I'd like to propose that more than the majority of people prefer not to change. I see it time and time again in both personal and professional life. People don't like to know their flaws and they don't want to improve. They'd rather hide their flaws from themselves and rationalize it is other people. So his idea to help people overcome their ""lack of empathy"" while noble is a pipe dream in my book. If he had specific methods of how to accomplish this, it would be a different story. Instead, he concludes the book with condemning the death penalty and explaining that ""evil"" actions of people are not exactly under their control. Instead, it is a combination of chemical, genetic and nurture. We should instead try to help rehabilitate all these people rather than sentence them in jail for years or kill them. These are the fancies of an ivory tower academician untouched by the stubborn people of the real world."
1,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"Reading this, I couldn't get out of my head that the author's first cousin is Sasha Baron-Cohen. It was the vision of the ultimate evil mischief-maker that Borat was. Borat in a fluorescent green mankini was behind every word I read. Once seen, never forgotten...  So one of them makes a living out of analysing people and philosophising on whether cruelty and evil is genetic and the other makes his living out of exploiting people with deliberate cruelty that I'm sure his victims think is evil.I know which I prefer. Schadenfreude is a very evil sense of humour. Laughing at other people's misfortune is cruel. I wonder if it was inborn in me or I acquired it?The book was ok, not exhaustive and I didn't agree with the author's conclusions quite often. 3.5 stars."
2,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3226609-the-angry-lawn-gnome,0,"I can't really review this book, for the simple reason that I do not trust it, and am simply unsure what to believe and what not to. Perhaps my attitude is unfair, but it was these two passages that pushed me into Sgt. Schultz mode:Some people compare him to the character that Dustin Hoffman played in the film Rain Man, which was based on a real person (Kim Peek) with autism, because... (p. 106, my edition)Consider that back in 1542 Martin Luther wrote a pamphlet entitled Against the Jews (calling on Catholics to attack them) in which he advocated burning synagogues and destroying Jewish homes. (p. 166, my edition)Kim Peek did not have autism. One need dig no deeper than his NY Times obituary (link) to ferret that fact out. I'd put this down as an honest mistake for most, but Baron-Cohen is supposed to be a world renowned expert on the topic of...autism. Sorry, dude, but you flat-out blew it.Martin Luther's tedious imbecility on the topic of Jews is certainly true, but how Baron-Cohen got the idea he was trying to incite Catholics against them is not only wrong, it is utterly preposterous. In fact, Luther even took a swipe at Catholics...in the very document Baron-Cohen claims was used ""incite"" them. Viz:Similarly among us Christians the papists can no longer pass for the church. For they will not let God be their God, because they refuse to listen to his word, but rather persecute it most terribly, then come along with their empty husks, chaff, and refuse, as they hold mass and practice their ceremonies. And God is supposed to recognize them and look upon them as his true church, ignoring the fact that they do not acknowledge him as the true God, that is, they do not want him to speak to them through his preachers. His word must be accounted heresy, the devil, and every evil. This he will indeed do, as they surely will experience, far worse than did the Jews.Link to document - The switch from Jews to Catholics occurs at the end of Part II, though it is back to the Jews in Part III.'Course Luther had a reason to be sore with Catholicism, since he'd been excommunicated and had a Church sanctioned document issued against him personally, wherein he could be killed on sight with neither civil nor religious penalties accruing against his murderer. (A Catholic version of a fatwa? Maybe. But it also seems to be the case that no one ever bothered trying, as best I can tell.) In fact, I'd say you could make a case Luther was saying Catholics, or possibly just the Church hierarchy, was in deeper doo-doo than Jews with God, based upon that last sentence.Perhaps the two errors cited above are the only two in the book, and perhaps everything else is scholarship so pure it hurts the eyes to glance upon. But I doubt it. In my eyes the entire book took on the mantle of sloppy scholarship after hitting those two easily checked, inexcusable errors. I make no claims at genius or expertise -- quite the contrary! -- so if I'm picking up on wince-worthy passages, how many more might there be in here? Certainly in the Martin Luther bit he cites a source that he himself never bothered reading. (Would he tolerate such a thing from one of his students?) Anyway, I'm giving the work no rating, since I cannot confidently say that there are sections of this work with which I have little familiarity (and that would be most of it) containing errors similar to the ones I've noted. His level of credibility with me has essentially fallen off a cliff; I'm not certain I'd accept anything he's written without independent verification. Very sad, since I'd previously held him in high regard."
3,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30422196-jessica,4,"4 Informative-Stars! ☆★☆★There are some books that you read with your mouth open and all of your emotions displayed across your face. This is one of those books. Be warned, 'The Science of Evil' will make you disgusted and enlightened at the same time. What dug into my heart even more were the real life photos of acts of terror. It's gut-wrenching to see what people are capable of. It's unspeakable. First Chapter: ★ Nazi scientists severed a woman's hands and then sewed them back Switched. So her thumbs on the outside of her hands.Holy F#%K!!!  ★ Some Nazi held experiments to see if people could survive being submerged in freezing water up to 3 hours. Double F#%K!! ★ Rebel soldiers ordering women to bash their children's heads into poles until they died to survive another day. Jesus, F#%king F#%K!!!!! ★ Nazis were not to first to kill thousands of people. The Turks killed over 1.5 million Armenians in 1890. They weren't even allowed to testify in court as witnesses, let alone pled their case. Did i say Fff#%kk!?!?!!! ★ In 1994, in Democratic Republic of Congo rebels attacked a village and forced a woman's son to have sex with her while they watched and then they shot him in front of her. Then each one of the soldiers raped the woman while her husband was forced to watch and then he was shot as well in front of the woman. Last but not least, they left her staring at her burning house and took her 3 daughters away from her. She hasn't heard from her daughters since. I cant even.... F... :oThe scariest part, these cruel people who did these operations were doctors. People we are brought up to trust, performing unethical experiments on innocent lives.And soldiers that are there to protect. I found it interesting how the author examined further into what makes people ""evil"". Evil is a broad definition that is used to describe many different people. He substituted evil with the word empathy or lack of empathy. Suddenly, character traits were more easily defined and their actions were explained. Some had lack of empathy because of their desire to protect and were blinded, others because of revenge or hate and in some instances, pure hunger. The things you will do when you've been starved for days, and pure instinct takes over are unfathomable. Emotions are dissected....“When our empathy is switched off, we are solely in the ""I"" mode. In such a state we relate only to things or to people as if they were just things.”Each chapter gave me goosebumps. I learned things that shocked me to the core! I had so many chills that i had to take breaks just to collect myself. Im grateful to learn about the human mind and how we as a society have evolved but some of these atrocities just made me sick. It was like reading horror story after horror story.  ★ Fun Fact: Marilyn Monroe's real name was Norma Jean Mortenson. Norma?! Really? ...huh. I guess I'm the only one who's a huge fan of Psycho. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ★ I never knew that Marilyn Monroe was a child of divorced parents and a mother who was in the psychiatric ward most of her life. She went from foster care to foster care. When she was 11 and she was sexually molested by her stepfather! What?! She first got married when she was 16 to her neighbor to get out of foster care. She remarried 2 more times to all failed marriages. She was in and out of psychiatric clinics like her mother and attempted suicide three times! She succeeded killing herself, overdosing in 1962. Whoa...I think my biggest take away after reading this book is how empathy is related to the brain. I never knew that certain parts of our brain control our lack or over abundance of the trait with hormones and proteins. It is really interesting. (-1★) I took away a star for the sole reason of some of the tests mentioned. 'Bla bla bla, this test shows this information according to this doctor and this many patients, bla bla bla, but it is not conclusive; or it was not proven; or the patients life history was never taken into account or recorded....etc.' ☠ -Wait, WHAT? Why would you mention test results if they are not 99% true or even taken correctly?! I felt like my time was wasted reading those sentences over and over again. When i read a science or psychology book i want concrete hard proof of the evidence your basing your topic on. Not hearsay. Its like saying ""1+1=11, because Eddie from the store told me, but it needs more working out."" Ugh!!!! ☠I liked the statement: ""Narcissists have monologues, not dialogues.""During the Nazi reign, people who helped gather up the jews did not consider themselves part of the killing, instead they justified their actions by making statements like this... ➤ Person A: ""I simply had the list of Jews in my municipality. I did not round up the Jews, but I did pass this list on when requested to do so."" ➤ Person B: ""I was told to go to these addresses, arrest these people, and take them to the train station. That's all I did.""  ➤ Person C: ""My job was to open the doors of the train—that was it."" ➤ Person D: ""My job was to direct the prisoners onto the train.""  ➤ Person E: ""My job was to close the doors, not to ask where the train was going or why.” ➤ Person F: ""My job was simply to drive the train.""  [through all the other small links in the chain that could lead to . . .] ➤ Person Z: ""My job was simply to turn on the showers out of which the poison gas was emitted.”All in all, there is a lot of important information in this book about the brain, people's personalities and upbringings. T discusses the how they impact one another and how to judge each one. This book made me dissect the word 'evil' as a word used to describe someone and dive further into what made them do the act. I enjoyed the book and appreciated the message. I agree that empathy or lack of empathy should hold a bigger part in psychology than it does. :)"
4,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1362376-avolyn-fisher,2,"I find that this book could be a lot shorter than it is, for the fact that it is repetitive and offers a lot of hypothesis and questions rather than answers or true discoveries. It regurgitates what has already been mentioned about narcissism, autism, antisocial disorder, and borderline disorder. I am not an expert on psychological studies but it appeared to only state what has already been stated and suggest that there are links between those disorders and levels of empathy in certain individuals and how that could potentially cause them to be inclined towards evil ways. Not that I think this is a bad link to be studying, but it basically stated that they are not sure if there is a link between the two and was so vague that I felt that this book accomplished nearly nothing. You are left with just as many questions if not more than when you went in and while it may be good in some cases to write something that causes society to question something that is being under-questioned, I read the book to get answers and data on proof or near-proof to actual conclusions.However the book was very interesting for about 5 pages when it discussed the discoveries about empathy that were observed in animals such as mice and monkeys. I felt that a more interesting question isn't how Hitler or certain people in history could be so evil but rather, how they were able to get so many 'normal' or 'common' people to commit such horrendous acts when they were seemingly healthy psychologically. The fact that Hitler may have been messed up psychologically and that that could have contributed to his demise is not ground breaking, earth shattering information that I couldn't have gathered on my own. It was interesting but I don't know that I would recommend it because I feel reading it came quite close to a waste of my time. Especially when you consider how many other books are out there to read and all the books you could be reading instead of this one."

6,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"I met Simon Baron Cohen in 2004 as part of my exploration of the role of empathy (and lack of it or autism) in my field of conflict research. He is an extraordinary person to discuss these issues, with and his knowledge and compassion for the children he treats for development disorders strongly evident. His book 'The Essential Difference' played a major role in the evolution of my theory of 'induced autism' in conflict. His latest book extends his thinking into the role of zero degrees of empathy in the commission of acts of extreme evil. Since I met him, neuroscience has moved on rapidly and his latest book brings up to date the 10 areas of the brain that seem most implicated in empathy, or its lack, and also the half a dozen or so genes whose expression also contributes a genetic dimension to empathy or its absence. Identical twin research suggests that empathy has about 60% heritability, but the sample size and peer review process is probably not complete for that to be taken as proven.I literally read this book in one sitting (despite the trans-Atlantic jet lag) and would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the problem of evil from a scientific viewpoint, and especially if you are interested in reducing it! Though the author warns at the onset: don't read this book if you are sensitive to descriptions of appalling evil, as that is how he starts out defining what he is trying to understand, though there is far more to the book than this. He systematically un-picks the different empathy deficiencies of borderline personality, psychopath and narcissistic disorders and how they have at their extreme zero degrees of empathy. His accounts of the genetic and developmental causes of these disorders is strongly evidence based, though in the case of extreme narcissism the research is so far limited.He also builds on his work in The Essential Difference on the systematizer/empathizer contrast and provides a convincing case that many of those with zero empathy are not borderline, psychopath or narcissistic but in fact use their strong systematizing to build very rigid moral structures. Extreme systematizers also have given us most of our science and technology.The only weak part of the book is that Simon stops too soon and his phenomenal ability to develop ways to address issues of autism is not fully deployed. He ends with ten steps to increase empathy in the world and even grow in those with zero degrees. I would have loved another full chapter on where now."
7,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,4,"Can evil be quantified? If you had to study 'evil' from a scientific perspective, with all the bells and whistles available within a laboratory, how would you go about it? This is the question that has fascinated me for a long time and if it fascinates you then this is a book you should peruse. Cohen begins with the fascinating idea of redefining evil as an absence of empathy. This tiny little change opens the door for a scientifically valid method of quantifying evil from a psychological perspective. If empathy is the ability to identify with someone else's thinking and responding in an acceptable manner then a complete absence of such an intuition opens the door for categorizing different personality types typically accused of being evil. The book initially elaborates on borderline personality disorder, psychopathy and narcissistic personality disorder. The author goes into detail with regards to the parts of the brain contributing to the sense of empathy (cumulatively the 'empathy circuit') and explains well how these areas fire abnormally in the brains of people with such psychological issues. The definition of empathy that the author proposes also opens up a window into understanding autism spectrum disorders from a fresh perspective. If psychopaths are people who do not feel any empathy (no affective empathy) but can recognize the feeling from the expressions/body language in others (cognitive empathy), what if people in the autistic spectrum are the exact opposite? According to this thesis, if the empathy circuit in the brain is wired such that a person can feel empathy (affective empathy) but cannot understand that others are capable of the same (cognitive empathy) then psychologists commonly diagnose such individuals under the umbrella term of autism-spectrum. Cohen gives a lot of experimental findings that seem to support this idea and to me it was a fascinating experience to gain a new perspective into autism and asperger syndrome. Here I also learned about 'alexithymia' - the inability of understanding emotion (of others and one's own), literally meaning 'without words for emotion' and this is something individuals with autism invariably experience (hence supporting the cognitive empathy prognosis in the previous sentence).Cohen's appeal that psychologists and psychiatrists should pay more attention to empathy and the empathy centers of their patients before treating them sounded like good advice by the end of the book. The main idea that this book propounds and one which I found fascinating even if it requires further experimental evidence to be accepted fully is that when acts of cruelty occur, they are invariably the result of a malfunctioning empathy circuit. Various factors could influence this malfunction such as genetics, cultural sanctions, personal ideology, obedience etc. This puts goosebumps-inducing force into the words of Historian Ian Kershaw - 
""The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference""
The reason why I enjoyed reading this book was summed up eloquently by the author himself - 
""If I have an agenda, it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the concept of ""evil"" as an explanatory tool, and if I have successfully moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.""
I enjoy books that talk about new ideas that I wasn't previously familiar with and that probably added to my enjoyment. If you are someone well-versed/well-read in cognitive psychology and behavioral sciences then there may not be much that is new here for you. For others, this may be a fun book to read."
8,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7532769-katherine,1,"Holy fear-mongering, Batman!Never have I read a book more toxic for the attitude towards the mentally ill. This book teaches the readers to be afraid of people who suffer really awful things already!!Not only are the facts in this book wrong (bpd patients not having empathy? Are you kidding me right now???), they are incredibly intolerant and hurtful. The last thing the mentally ill need are outsiders telling them they're awful, unethical, evil people the way this book argues. If you value the respect of anyone with a mental illness, please do not touch this book."
9,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This is a disappointing book. The author overstates the case for empathy. ""Empathy itself is the most valuable resource in the world,"" he writes. Since uncaring leads to cruelty and inappropriate social responses, he argues that we need more empathy. If it were as simple as asserting that it be so. The author defines empathy as only a good thing as far as social relationships are concerned, but some have argued that it is this capacity to identify with what goes on in others that gives sadists pleasure or possibly underlies homophobia. Still, we know that the author doesn't mean that kind of empathy. He says the good kind of empathy varies across a range (the empathy bell curve) from zero to much, and argues that both environmental and genetic factors interact in ways that determine where one falls within that range. That suggests we can work on enhancing empathy (teaching, good habits, etc.), but it also suggests that a good part of human kind is inherently predisposed to anti-social behavior.Then there are the empirical measures the author uses for empathy. Empirical suggests scientific, but the measures seem subjective and likely miss the essence of what he's after. Among his top ten measures, he asks whether one enjoys caring for others, whether it's hard to know what to do in a social situation, and whether it bothers one to be late meeting a friend. It's common enough to not really ""enjoy caring"" for others, but that's not the same as wishing them ill and acting to harm. It could be the awkwardness of a social situation is due to boredom or frustration with superficiality. As for lateness, does this mean a good part of the non western world is not empathetic? If these questions seem nit picky, look at these measures from another perspective: Are some ""non-empathetic"" sociopaths good at manipulation because they are acutely aware of how others will react to what they do?Something more fundamental is missing from this discussion of ""the science of evil."" The widespread cruelty throughout history by leaders and collective groupings of people points in the direction of deeper biological factors that override empathy. These, for example, may involve the role of alpha leaders and their followers, and tribal dynamics that result in the need to hate, demonize and dehumanize. "
10,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"Interesting book. That's about all I can really say. I don't find this as practical for the ""layperson"" as some books on the idea of evil and the human brain and mind are. Still you may find it draws you in a bit.I think how this one hits you will depend on your own bent and interests. I picked it up after reading a few books on Psychopathy. That's not exactly what's discussed here, but it is interesting."
11,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17817291-tim,4,"An attempt to explain evil from an empirical standpoint rather than an ideological or a philosophical one. The author is only dealing with a certain type of evil; not natural evil (things like earthquakes and flooding) but moral evil (things like murder and rape). In a move parallel to Augustine of Hippo, he defines evil in terms of privation. Just as one might define darkness as the absence of light, Augustine defined evil as the absence of good, and Baron-Cohen defines it as the absence of empathy. There is a continuum between light and darkness. People are not either staring directly into the sun or trapped in a lightless grotto deep beneath the earth at any given moment (I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the fact that a person who is staring at the sun and a person trapped in a lightless room are equally blind serves as a useful metaphor for the dangers of extremism). One can parallel the light/dark continuum with the continuum between empathy and a lack of empathy in the psychology of individual human beings. It is by using this continuum that the author tries to better understand human evil. The author considers two ways of relating to the world, the Ich-Du (I-you) mode of being and the Ich-Es (I-it) mode of being. In the first mode of being you connect with another person as the end in itself. A highly empathetic person would operate in this mode of being since they would have the ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion. In the second mode of being you connect with another person as a means to an end. They are not a person so much as an object to be used in the pursuit of some purpose. A person without empathy operates entirely in the Ich-Es mode of being. People are things. The author writes: 'Treating other people as if they were just objects is one of the worst things you can do to another human being, to ignore their subjectivity, their thoughts and feelings.' As the old chest nut goes, you can love people and use things or love things and use people.A mistake we might make is thinking once again that these are binary options. The author uses the helpful metaphor of a light switch. It is not a matter of whether we are in the off position (Ich-Es) or the on position (Ich-Du) because people are not like traditional light switches that must be entirely in one of these states or the other. They are more like dimmer switches. Empathy erosion is like a person who has the dimmer switch turned low, either as a temporary state or as a permanent trait. In his words: 'I'm going to argue that some people are at the low end of this empathy dimension in a potentially permanent way, and that some (but not all) of those at this extreme end are whom we might call “evil” or cruel. That is, they never had much empathy and they may never. Others may be at the low end of the empathy dimension because they experienced a transient shutting down of their empathy as the result of their current situation. That is, they had empathy and lost it, however briefly. But however you get to this low point on the empathy scale, the result can be the same. At that point you become capable of dehumanizing other people, of turning other people into objects, and this can have tragic consequences.'The author rightly points out that saying people engage in certain behaviours because they are evil is a sort of non-explanation: 'Why did the murderer kill the innocent child? Because he was evil. Why did the terrorist become a suicide bomber? Because she was evil.' The empirical approach he advocates is not content to merely slap a label on this type of behaviour and be done with it but is an attempt to understand how some people are capable of behaving in ways that other people find abhorrent. To do this he substitutes the phrase 'empathy erosion' where we would usually place the word evil. He then asks two questions: 1) What is empathy? 2) Why do some people have less than others?He writes: 'Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention.' You actively step out of your perspective and to the best of your ability step into the perspective of the other. Here is a real world example the author gives: 'I sat in Alyth Gardens synagogue in Golders Green in north London last year. Two men went up on the stage. The first one spoke. “I am Ahmed, and I am a Palestinian. My son died in the Intifada, killed by an Israeli bullet. I come to wish you all Shabbat Shalom.” Then the other man spoke. “I am Moishe, and I am an Israeli. My son also died in the Intifada, killed by a homemade petrol bomb thrown by a Palestinian teenager. I come to wish you all Salaam Aleikem.”I was shocked: Here were two fathers, from different sides of the political divide, united by their grief and now embracing each other's language. How had they met? Moishe had taken the opportunity offered by a charity called the Parents Circle for Israelis and Palestinians to make free phone calls directly into each other's homes to express their empathy to bereaved parents on the other side of the barbed-wire fence. Ahmed described how he had been at home in Gaza one day when the phone rang. It was Moishe, at that time a stranger in Jerusalem, who had taken that brave first step. They both openly wept on the phone. Neither had ever met or spoke to someone from the other community, but both told the other they knew what the other was going through.'The book delves a fair bit into the brain based aspect of empathy, identifying ten areas of the brain that are associated with the ability to empathize with other people. Much of this area of research is based on the behaviour of people that have suffered damage to these areas of the brain. The author also examines studies on whether there are correlations between how active any of these areas are and the level of empathy a particular individual demonstrates.Four types of non-empathetic people are examined in depth, three that the author identifies as level 0 negative personalities (borderline personality disorder, psychopathy, and narcissism) and one level 0 positive personality (Asperger's Syndrome). The author then goes on to consider the role of genetic and environmental factors in how empathetic any particular individual is. As is often the case in behavioural studies, comparing the behaviour of identical and non-identical twins is considered, and also whether adopted children end up sharing more in common with their birth parents or their adopted parents. The book also looks at empathy in the animal kingdom.The book ends with a number of questions for further study: Are evil acts always the result of early environmental factors (emotional deprivation) or biological factors (genes and/or hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.) affecting the empathy circuit? If empathy is missing in childhood or adolescence, can it be developed later? The role of biology and environment in fashioning the self you are is an interesting question in itself. It is kind of hard to deny they play a very large role in making you the self that you are but a further question is this: can the self that you are then turn around and take a conscious hand in fashioning who it is? I am inclined to say yes.I mostly agree with what the author has to say in this book. The biggest problem I have with it is that though it is only a partial explanation, it is presented in a way that lulls you into thinking it is a complete explanation. One could easily imagine situations where it is your experiencing empathy for another person that could lead to morally ambiguous actions so whatever empirical approach you might want to take to understanding evil, there are clearly more facets to it than a lack of empathy. The fact that he spends a portion of the book discussing non-empathic people that are not malevolent demonstrates that there are other factors to consider. Evil requires a better explanation than the mere absence of something. It clearly has positive (in the sense of existent) qualities of its own. To steal a metaphor from Dorothy L. Sayers, the categories are not Hamlet and non-Hamlet, they are Hamlet and anti-Hamlet."
12,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21372390-wayne-barrett,4,"Interesting details concerning the make-up of evil inherent in the human species, especially dealing with empathy, or as touched on in this book, the lack thereof. This book broke down the science of the condition, explaining how that we are all not, either good or bad, but rather in measure, we are all a mixture of both. I'm reminded of the cartoon I used to see where every person has an invisible little angel on one shoulder and a little devil on the other, each trying to persuade us to do either right or wrong. Simon used a scale, breaking down the difference between those who only had minor deficiencies in expressing empathy and those who lack it completely. A lot of the signs are characteristics that I recognize in people I have known throughout my life; some to a greater extent than others. I thought the part that was most disturbing was the realization that those who are at the lowest scale in lacking empathy can not only be extremely heartless and cruel, but in most cases, do not even realize that they are being that way. Their brains are not wired to make the distinction. A person who could hurt, or possibly even kill, for whatever exaggerated reason and not feel the slightest regret or even understand that what they have done is wrong, is about as scary a monster as I can imagine. Over all this was an informative read on the subject, and I have a much clearer understanding now of my ex-wife."
13,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5244888-nina,4,"I have approached writing this book review several times and have hesitated ...This book was extremely difficult for me to review because it is a nice, neat, concise little package, which I felt was rather suspect considering the daunting topic of providing an explanation for human cruelty. I expected complexity, but I almost feel as if Baron-Cohen has provided a simple “no brainer”: people who are capable of cruelty lack empathy. Honestly though, he goes a little further and he groups his findings into neat categorizations, which are admittedly quite intriguing. He talks specifically about personality “disorders”, three in particular, and how they all involve impaired empathy as one of their traits. Baron-Cohen writes neatly and tidily and presents his theories very simply and attainably for the lay reader.I suppose my real difficulty, in the process of creating a review, was accepting his theories. At best, I think what Baron-Cohen has done is put the available pieces of a puzzle together and extrapolated what was missing, to create a partial picture of what is occurring on a societal and personal level with regards to people with impaired empathy. I think what is missing is the complete science, the complete understanding of the intricacies of the internal functions of the brain. Baron-Cohen layers in some psychology with the explanation of each “zero empathy” case, what makes them unique, and summarizes his theories will a philosophical final chapter. Nice, neat, right? The problem is that which is classified as “borderline” is neither simple, neat nor concise. There are borderlines who do not harm others in the extreme way as in the singular example. There are also psychopaths who exude empathy, enough in fact to lure and trap victims. They ARE reading people, whether their neural activity is demonstrating so or not. Meanwhile people with Asperger’s Syndrome are kind of the anomaly, there is a distinction making them zero empathy positive: morals. Yet, the very existence of morals demands an understanding of empathy. Morals are social rules; social rules are learned or understood mainly through empathy. Or so it would seem?In addition to categorizing minds and personalities along a spectrum of empathy, Baron-Coen goes further to suggest that conventional systems of justice should not be applicable to certain kinds of zero empathy behavior, especially when the person committing the offense suffers from conditions such as autism. Baron-Cohen suggests an inherent lack of moral agency in a person suffering from autism, based on the fact that in an autistic mind the empathy circuit had been negatively impacted. Without empathy autistic people might be inclined to commit socially inappropriate acts. However, in his view they should not be held responsible according to classical retributive justice systems because if their mind is impaired they lack the requisite moral agency to know how to better behave. This argument is of course interlaced with the debate on free will and human consciousness. Baron-Cohen clearly acknowledges this and also the fact that, in the case of grave crime, restoring a sense of justice is crucial for ensuring societal peace. The final issue which was not addressed much in the book, are the evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of possessing empathy or lacking empathy. While some theorists argue that empathy is at the root of human survival, others believe that the capability for switching off the empathy circuit could be to an evolutionary advantage. One thing was clear when reading Baron-Cohen’s sensitive writing on the subject; he is a scientist, a systematized thinker, with a clear and genuine function of empathy. I learned much from this book and it is recommended reading for any interested in psychology and neuroscience."
14,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,4,"I picked up this book because the dust jacket mentioned the role of mirror neurons in how people understand one another. Baron-Cohen argues that mirror neurons are only a small part of a more elaborate system he calls the empathy circuit. Using a questionnaire (a copy of which is in the book) that measures empathy, what he calls the empathy quotient, he focuses on those who measure zero. As you might anticipate, psychopaths are on this end of the scale. What is interesting is that he also places borderline personalities and the narcissistic personalities there as well. He calls this group zero negative, meaning, they measure zero in empathy and have negative personality traits. Naturally, there are a range of scores that can be found in these groups and, when you look at the questions used in the instrument and try to imagine someone who scores zero, you know they are, thankfully, rare. Perhaps more interesting though, he describes those with Asperger's syndrome and autism as zero positive, meaning that though they have zero empathy, they do not generally hurt others. Rather, they choose to avoid social situations altogether. They may be strong in something he calls the systemizer quotient meaning they are able to see patterns where others don't.These classifications are underpinned by reference to neuroimaging studies that have focused on those areas of the brain that have been found to be involved in empathy. Those who score low or zero in empathy have underactive empathy pathways as demonstrated by these studies.The framework described here leads to lots of questions: what problems are encountered by people who score very high on the EQ? What environmental cues are important in encouraging and empathic state (as distinct from trait)? This is especially interesting in the health care setting where, I expect we have many situations that blunt people who are normally empathic. However, is it always useful to be very empathic? If a surgeon were to be highly empathic, would he/she be able to do their job? "

I think I only missed out two chapters in the end but ohh boy, this is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read, smartly written, entertaining and very informative! It even debunks to an extent the idea that those with autism spectrum disorder and psychopathy don't have any empathy, rather, they both lack a specific type of empathy (autism cognitive empathy, psychopaths affective empathy) which has vastly different effects on the brain and behaviour - a really interesting conclusion rooted in evidence with potentially huge ramifications if it is correct. I found myself buzzing with interest and excitement while reading this. Would 100% recommend to anyone interested in empathy, cruelty, autism and personality disorders. Definitely don't need to go into this with any psychology knowledge either because it's so well written, engaging and accessible. Hopefully I can go back and read those last few chapters one day. :)Favourite Quote:'This suggests people with Asperger Syndrome are the mirror image of those with Type P: Psychopaths have intact cognitive empathy but reduced affective empathy, whilst people with Asperger Syndrome have intact affective empathy but reduced cognitive empathy. The result is that people with Asperger Syndrome do care about others, whilst struggling to 'read' them. Those with Type P don't care about others, whilst 'reading' them with ease.'"

The environment vs. genetics issues are explored and how a deadly mixture of both may create the monsters who engage in cruel acts. But the book also explores the minds of people who seem to lack empathy, but do not commit evil acts, because they have a very structured moral code. (People who fall somewhere on the autism spectrum.) As the mother of a 27-year-old man who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, I was struck by how much my son DIDN'T resemble the Asperger's Syndrome individuals Baron-Cohen discusses: my son has clearly shown empathy for others on a number of occasions. So either there's a broad spectrum within Asperger's, too, or - my son has something other than Asperger's. Baron-Cohen's argument that anorexics fall somewhere in the spectrums mentioned above, because they show a lack of empathy for their anguished parents, failed to persuade me of its correctness. "

21,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409682-oscar,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen addresses the question of evil with an emphasis on moving away from biblical or religious theories towards scientific and psychiatric explanations. Baron-Cohen argues that much of what can constitute cruelty towards others is a result of a lack of empathy, that is, lacking feeling towards the victim and seeing them more or less as objects. In the book, Baron-Cohen argues that empathy exists on a spectrum, and while anyone can lack empathy for a brief moment, the book argues that three personality types which are borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial have zero empathy and seem prone towards act of cruelty. Baron-Cohen then looks at physiological, genetic, and environmental factors that lead to such personalities and takes a look at how such people's lack of empathy might lead to behaviors that might be deemed as evil. The book, then, complicates things by looking beyond such personalities and looking at people on the autistic spectrum, who lack empathy, but are not necessarily prone to cruelty. The book, moreover, also looks at cruel actions that seem to have been perpetrated by groups or individuals that do not have either of the three personality types.I was fascinated by the discussion of the book and believe that its strength lies largely in its discussion, observations, and philosophy towards the concept of empathy and how it serves to encourage evil and cruel behavior. If anything, I believe, that the book could have continued and expanded its discussion, but a useful foundation on the topic was presented, and it will undoubtedly push readers to ask further questions regarding the complicated conceptualization of evil in humanity. "
22,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601231-michael-george,5,"The Science of EvilS. Baron-CohenBasic Books, 2011What is evil? This is a question that is addressed in the first chapter of this book. The point of view is adopted to discuss this from the standpoint of a lack of empathy. In the second chapter, empathy is discussed as if it were a measurable characteristic, with a variation in the human population characterized by a “bell-shaped curve”. The concept of “empathy quotient”, or EQ, is introduced, and we are introduced to a questionnaire whose results can be assessed quantitatively, and which can be used to measure empathy. With respect to this questionnaire, the author refers to a research paper, by S. Baron-Cohen and S. Wainwright, entitled “The Empathy Quotient (EQ): An investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences” from the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, vol. 34, pages 163 – 175 (2004). Prof. Baron-Cohen asserts that empathy can be studied from a neuroscience perspective, and that there are specific brain structures, which he refers to as the “empathy circuit” that relate to empathy. He calls EQ results that are very low, zero degrees of empathy.Prof. Baron-Cohen considers what it would mean to associate a lack of empathy with evil. First, he wishes to show that the brain regions of the empathy circuit are noticeably low-functioning in people who can be identified as having very low EQs. Next, he seeks to clarify the psychology of the people who score very low EQs. Does this psychology relate to acts of cruelty? In addition, he wishes to study this from the medical point of view as a possible pathology. Is very low EQ inevitably associated with human cruelty? This is a very important question because, of course, EQ can be objectively measured. The author explores this question in chapters 3 and 4 of his book. In Chap. 3 he outlines evidence that couples with very low EQ that indicates the possibility of making certain correspondences with violence, aggression, and possible acts of cruelty in human beings. In Chapter 4, he points to a whole category of individuals with low EQs who, far from behaving cruelly, seem to display quite gentle, humane and non-aggressive dispositions. It is this categorical type of association in which he is interested. People with certain identifiable psychological types, and with correlated very low EQs can be studied scientifically, for example, by using the methods of neuroscience.Evidently, these identifiable psychological types have been sculpted by our biology, through genetics and environmental processes, mainly from early childhood. Therefore, having discussed types that seem to be associated with very low EQ, the author investigates, in Chapter 5, genetic correlates, and biological correlates. Prof. Baron-Cohen recognizes it as ideal to make these biological associations, to bring to bear well-developed capabilities of science.Having demonstrated the possibility of a science of evil, and discussed progress that has been made, in the last chapter of the book, the Prof. Baron-Cohen tries to capture the science in a broader perspective. An important consideration is what the consequences of a science of evil would mean.The early chapters in the book, laying the groundwork and discussing the possibility for the science are very important. However, let us focus on this last chapter. This is Chapter 6 and it is called “Reflections on Human Cruelty”. Certainly, when one thinks about evil, one associates it, in terms of its contrast with good, with moral philosophy or with religion, not with science. Prof. Baron-Cohen was hoping to introduce science in terms of ten points he discusses in the last chapter of his book.The first point is associated with empathy, in that, in having an EQ, or empathy quotient, from taking the survey he and his associates developed, one can place oneself on a spectrum from low EQ to high. This EQ, more fundamentally, from a scientific perspective, is related to our biology. With respect to evil, Prof. Baron-Cohen focused, and this is his second point, on very low EQ, and asked the question whether there are recognizable psychological types associated with low EQ. He is able to associate, with what he calls Zero-Negative, three types: P, N and B. These are highly recognizable types that are ordinarily regarded as psychological disorders. The word “zero” in Zero-Negative is meant to suggest the relationship to very low EQ and the word “Negative” is meant to imply that people in these categories are associated with pathological psychological behavior.In one of the appendices of his book and in Chapter 3, Prof. Baron-Cohen gives brief descriptions to help recognize these types. Type P, for example, which is associated with psychopathic personality disorder, is associated with:Superficial charm;Lack of anxiety or guilt;Undependability and dishonesty;Egocentricity;Inability to form lasting intimate relationships;Failure to learn from punishment;Poverty of emotions;Lack of insight into the impact of their behavior;Failure to plan ahead.Such criteria are matters of degree, and clearly depend somewhat on the subjective judgment of the observer. However, the claim is that this, with more precise clinical designations, is a medical pathology recognizable to trained psychiatrists. Similarly, type N, associated with narcissistic personality disorder, and type B, associated with borderline personality disorder, are claimed by the author to be conditions subject to diagnostic criteria of pathologies, and not strictly subjective categories.The third point that the author wishes to emphasize is that these recognizable types, when subjected to standard neuroscience procedures, tend to display atypical patterns of responses in the “circuitry” of the brain associated with empathy. The fact that atypical responses are indicated gives a diagnostic tool for these categories. A fourth point is that once one has associated behavior with brain circuitry, treatments are suggested which might alter these responses, and possibly affect an improvement in the psychological condition, in itself. For example, people with autism also tend to score very low EQs and have atypical brain responses in empathy circuitry, but are not Zero-Negative. In Prof. Baron-Cohen’s researches on autism, his research group developed educational software for autistic children that has led to changes in these brain responses and higher EQs. It is possible that the same might also be observed for people who are Zero-Negative. The fact that brain circuitry is very complex, and not likely to be subject to any conscious control that might deceive psychiatrists is significant in this regard.One startling finding from psychology about the types P and B is that quite often it is found that the environments people of these types were subject to were abusive or very harsh. This correlation relates to the author’s fifth point. We certainly cannot ascribe a causal relation to a statistical correlation. However, results of psychological observations certainly suggest that a nurturing environment as a child may be highly correlated with a substantial EQ, or a high degree of empathy. Prof. Baron-Cohen says this can lead to what is observed as early secure attachment, and “can be understood as an internal pot of gold”.Prof. Baron-Cohen makes five further important points:There are genes for empathy;One category of low EQ is not associated with pathology, but is actually positive: Zero-Positive, associated with autism spectrum conditions;Zero-Positive is the result of a mind constantly striving to step out of time, to set aside the temporal dimension in order to see – in stark relief – the eternal repeating patterns of nature;The Zero-Positive mind finds change toxic;Empathy is the most valuable resource in our world;Having made these assertions, the author discusses some outstanding puzzles that remain. The author feels that he has just begun to explore interesting questions and that many remain. For example, one obvious and pertinent question is: Are there other categories that are identifiably low EQ?Since Prof. Baron-Cohen has discussed the fact that certain pathologies can be tied to specific diagnostic features of an empathy circuit, he also wishes to consider the extent to which this low EQ type of diagnoses can be incorporated or has been incorporated into psychiatry. He discusses this in the context of the DSM-IV (“Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”, fourth ed.), which is one of the most important reference books that psychiatrists consult in their diagnoses. He is interested in introducing an “empathy disorder” category in this book, and he discusses what this might mean with respect to certain types of criminal activity, which he believes relates to low empathy. He discusses this both in relation to people who commit crimes who are evidently Zero-Negative, as well as in relation to people involved in criminal activity who are Zero-Positive, and he definitely believes that, with respect to punishments, when people are committing a crime that seems to be related to their lack of empathy, that a certain level of compassion in meting out their punishment would be wise. These are speculative issues that Prof. Baron-Cohen is discussing, and he does point out that, at the time of writing his book, there was no plan to introduce an empathy disorder category in the next edition of the DSM. It should be mentioned that empathy is discussed in DSM-IV, for example, in the narcissistic personality disorder (which is the type N that Prof. Baron-Cohen studied), however, there is no specific empathy disorder category.A very interesting issue discussed by Prof. Baron-Cohen in this last chapter of his book is the “banality of evil”, first noted by the political theorist Hannah Arendt on observing the trial of the Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, in a Jerusalem court. In this context, one pictures the accommodation people can make, when they are a part of a long chain of small acts that end or begin in cruelty, an acquiescence to authority or part of a greater group conformity. Here, one is dealing with ordinary people, performing unempathic acts. Is it possible that people with average EQs can “switch off” their empathy temporarily? This brings up even deeper questions of possible implications for evil or cruel acts of just the typical person. This counterintuitive notion means that evil or the refraining from evil acts, is not necessarily something that can be addressed by science. However, the question of an “underactive” empathy circuit in the brain is manifested in this, and Prof. Baron-Cohen dedicates a section of the chapter to this.There definitely seem to be certain biological events and factors, that can manifest themselves at critical points in a person’s life, often in early childhood, that can irreversibly drive the empathy circuit toward atypical responses. Furthermore, Prof. Baron-Cohen stresses that changes in this circuitry, whether irreversible or not, can be correlated with systemizing behavior versus empathic responses. Does this mean that a correlation is being established at a scientific level to what we regard as evil or cruel behavior?In bringing up the point about irreversibility, Prof. Baron-Cohen is induced, in the next section of the chapter to consider the extent to which changes in EQ or empathy, as indicated by responses in brain circuitry, can be reversed. Prof. Baron-Cohen, in the face of knowledge of crimes, criminals and criminal behavior, maintains a somewhat positive attitude, as he expresses here, through a quote from one of his friends, Peter Lipton, given as part of a sermon: “If we treat another person as emotionally bad, we dehumanize him or her. If we take the view that every human being has some good in them, even if it is only 0.1 percent of their makeup, then by focusing on their good part, we humanize them. By acknowledging and attending to and rewarding their good part, we allow it to grow, like a small flower in a desert.”Basically, in considering the lack of empathy, we are anticipating more of a focus on systemization or logic. In the next section, Prof. Baron-Cohen briefly considers what it means as we allow empathy to have an increasing role. He pictures this as allowing the empathy circuit more of a role, and this, he speculates, permits us to mirror ourselves in another and allow us to see the other as less of an object and more alive to us. He then discusses briefly why the distribution for EQ is in the shape of a bell, if a heavier weighting for empathy is positive. Why are the “super” empathic rare? To a certain extent, the balance between empathy and systemizing occurs from biological pressures for survival, but as the author emphasizes in the last section of the book, where he discusses the ongoing strife between Israel and the Palestinians, empathy as a resource is somewhat taken for granted, and we often fail to recognize its benefits. He leaves us with a hopeful message: “Empathy is a universal solvent. Any problem immersed in empathy becomes solvable.”The book is well-structured, and well-edited, with the beginning paragraph of each chapter serving to bring us into the concerns of the chapter, and the last paragraph providing a message or perspective for us. The chapter titles are well-chosen, and the headings for each section in a chapter provide good descriptions for the discussion of that section. Furthermore, in one appendix, an EQ or empathy quotient survey is provided, so that we can gauge for ourselves the specifics of the measurement of empathy that Prof. Baron-Cohen and his co-workers have developed. For further exploration, he supplies us with references to a historical account of empathy by J. Rifkin and an evolutionary account by F. de Waal. The book Prof. Baron-Cohen has written is short, but his discussions about psychology and neuroscience are interesting at the level of the general educated person, and, although not a novel idea, his possible association of lack of empathy with evil and cruelty benefit from his scientific expertise in neuroscience and the study of autism. I recommend this book as an alternative focused on science to a consideration of evil focused on religion or moral philosophy, which would be independent of any bias for or against religious belief. He shows that the scientific point of view may have considerable value for us in our daily lives, in weighing the meaning of criminal of evil acts, and in assisting in psychiatric diagnoses and treatment."
23,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122610-jef-sneider,3,"This is really not a book about evil. Believe the subtitle. The author makes his case that there are individuals who are hard wired, by genetics and development, to lack empathy and that 3 types of these individuals are capable of inflicting harm on others without considering the harm done. Three types of personality disorder fit into the most harmful category as we know it from standard psychological classifications: psychopathic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders. When fully expressed, people with each of these disorders really suffer from a lack of empathy. They are unable to feel or understand what another person feels. The author uses scientific evidence to show that empathy is wired into 10 different regions of our brains and that the brains of people who lack empathy show both anatomic variations and differences from ""normal"" on functional MRI scanning. For each of us, other people may be reduced to objects at times of stress. Soldiers in the heat of battle, must see the enemy, for better or worse, as an enemy, not a human being. Each of us, when stressed or hurried, might walk by a person lying on the street and not even notice the human being that is there. Sometimes shutting down our empathy circuits is a good thing, a positive adaptation. A surgeon needs to see only the problem she is working on, not the human being. All of these cases occur in everyday life. Most people are capable of recognizing, at least in retrospect, that we have caused harm by objectifying others. We can experience regret, remorse and even shame for our actions. This is not so with those who truly lack empathy. Their behavior shows that they treat other people as objects to be manipulated, and their thoughts often conform without regret and without shame. Of course, a lack of empathy alone does not lead to evil actions. The author argues that environmental factors and opportunity combined with a lack of empathy can lead to some awful actions, including abuse, neglect, and murder. Examples are cited which are real, and they just make me shake my head. We know that there are people who do evil. We just can't understand it.Simon Baron-Cohen helps us to understand how it is possible, due to a total lack of empathy, for a mother to neglect her children, for a father to rape his daughter and keep her locked up for years and for a gang member to rape and murder without remorse. Unfortunately, he is less helpful helping us figure out to do with knowledge based on his theories and evidence. The people he describes would generally be thought of as ""bad people"" who do bad things and should be punished or just locked away to keep the rest of us safe. Or should they? Can people who are biologically lacking in empathy be rehabilitated? Can they change? Can they learn empathy? Are they responsible for their crimes? With a few quick remarks about the death penalty and philosophy, the book draws to a conclusion. This has left me with an uneasy feeling. I am uneasy just being reminded that there are people out there who can commit crimes and hurt people as a matter of course, with no thoughts to the feelings of their victims. I know these people exist. I know that they do bad things. I just find that explaining their evil actions using a fixed biological and scientific framework leaves me with a very negative and depressing and hopeless view of the world. How can we escape the biology of ruthless killers in the world? To paraphrase Jack Nicholson's character speaking in the movie A Few Good Men, ""We can't handle the truth!"" He may be right."

When Zero Degrees of Empathy Is Negative, 4.When Zero Degrees of Empathy Is Positive, 5. The Empathy Gene Twins, and 6. Reflections on Human Cruelty.Positives:1.	A well-written, well-researched book.2.	A fascinating topic, the science of evil, in the capable hands of Simon Baron-Cohen. He treats this controversial topic with care and respect.3.	The book flows nicely from one chapter to the next.4.	Limited but good use of charts and figures.5.	Does a great job of establishing the expectations of the book. “In this book I explore how people can treat each other cruelly not with reference to the concept of evil, but with reference to the concept of empathy. Unlike the concept of evil, empathy has explanatory power. In the coming chapters I put empathy under the microscope.”6.	Provides four examples of empathy erosion. Memorable accounts.7.	Defines the key term of the book to satisfaction, “Empathy is our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.” “This suggests there are at least two stages in empathy: recognition and response.”8.	The seven likely settings of the Empathizing Mechanism. From level 0 where the individual has no empathy at all to level 6 where individuals show remarkable empathy.9.	Great use of current science to make compelling arguments. “There is a consensus in neuroscience that at least ten interconnected brain regions are involved in empathy (and more may await discovery).” Explains in an accessible manner these brain regions and their relationship with empathy.10.	The three forms of Zero-Negative: Zero-Negative Borderline (Type B), Zero-Negative Psychopath (Type P), and Zero-Negative Narcissist (Type N). Provides case studies for each one. “The hallmark of borderlines is a constant fear of abandonment, emotional pain and loneliness, hatred (of others and of themselves), impulsivity, and self-destructive, highly inconsistent behavior.”11.	Explores the causes of the Zero-Negative degrees of empathy. “Common within families of children who later grow up to become borderline are incest, child abuse, violence, and alcoholism. Obviously, the link between child abuse and borderline is not total: Not all who are abused go on to become borderline, and not all those who are borderline were abused.”12.	The difference between the psychopath and borderline behavior. “When we meet the psychopath, we see a person who shares that same total preoccupation with oneself as we saw in Type B. But in this case there is a willingness to do whatever it takes to satisfy their desires.”13.	Interesting facts. “About 15 percent of prison samples are psychopaths and just less than 1 percent of males in the general population.”14.	A look at Zero-Positive degrees of empathy. “Zero-Positive means that alongside difficulties with empathy, these individuals have remarkably precise, exact minds. They have Asperger Syndrome, a condition on the autistic spectrum.”15.	A look at the autistic brain, a sensitive topic treated with respect. “In addition to difficulty in understanding others, people who are Zero-Positive have difficulty understanding their own minds, a difficulty called “alexithymia,” which translates as “without words for emotion.””16.	The two ways to systemize. “The first is by observation alone. We observe the changing data and then look for a pattern in the data. The second way we systemize is by observation plus operation. We observe the data and then perform some operation (manipulating one variable) and observe the effect of that operation.”17.	A look at the new evidence that environmental factors interact with “genes for empathy.” “In the “right” environment someone with the genetic predisposition to psychopathy could show this behavior.” “Some scientists have focused their search for empathy genes on those that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin. Too much serotonin in the synapse has been linked to aggression.”18.	Presents ten new ideas that focus on empathy erosion versus “evil”. 19.	A look at superempathy. 20.	Provides supplementary material on the empathy quotient and how to spot zero degrees of empathy (negative). Negatives:1.	Neuroscience is in its infancy and as a result the book may not have the feel of a hard science but I thought the author didn’t oversell what we currently know. 2.	There are some topics that were barely touched, as an example, aggression in males versus females. Aggression and how it varies by culture.3.	I would like to see an update to the book so that the author can address some of the criticism.4.	An appendix explaining the author’s methodology would have been helpful.In summary, I enjoyed this book. This is a very interesting topic and Baron-Cohen treats the topic fairly without overselling what we currently know. Though the author left many fruits on the tree what’s in the book is very good. I recommend it.

28,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"I have read many books on psychopathy and narcissism lately. This is definitely one of the best one I have read yet. Baron-Cohen found the common factor linking borderline personality disorder (type P), psychopathic/ antisocial personality disorder (type P), narcissistic personality disorder (type N), and autism/Asperger's. He found that types B, P, and N were far more of a concern than Asperger's. While he acknowledged the difficulty of Autism at the more severe end of this spectrum, he cautioned against pathologizing different ways of thinking. Best discussion of autism I have read to date. There were a few things that bothered me, all of which seem to be common in books dealing with human behavior. For example, he could have been more critical when discussing twin studies. He managed to convey some criticisms but wholly ignored others, such as epigenetic regulation of genes, similar twin environments despite separation from birth parents and siblings, etc. When discussing MAOA alleles, he gave the briefest overview and omitted critical information, such as the fact that in the absence of abuse, the ""warrior"" copy of MAOA actually results in *lower* aggression levels. He could have been more specific about the role of maltreatment in gene development (BDNF or other brain building regions that contribute to impulse control).Even with those concerns, relative to other books available on these subjects, Baron-Cohen is easily one of the best. "
29,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262996-kate-woods-walker,3,"For those who follow this subject, there's not much new here. And I don't necessarily agree with all the author's assertions. (Are psychopaths, borderlines and narcissists all truly ""zero empathy?"" I doubt it.) But he presents his case fairly well, and every genuine voice in the battle against ""evil"" deserves a hearing.Baron-Cohen's work in The Science of Evil rests on the narrow fence between pop psychology and serious research. And with glaring flaws like the twice-made proposition that the words ""evil"" and ""empathy"" can be substituted one for another (wha?), I was left less impressed with the seriousness of the book than carried along by a competent, if sometimes a bit dry, voice. However, once I got to the author's notes at the end of the book, I found the engaging writer I should have met in the first chapter, and I wondered why such human touches were buried in the back of the book.Baron-Cohen marries scientific research and religious impulse well in the final sections of the book, and makes a solid moral case for refusing to give up on any living human being, no matter the evil they may have displayed. So it's obvious he's coming at this subject from a purely academic, and not a personal, point of view. As for me, I think I prefer my old-school black and white, shake-the-dust way of looking at evil. In my rear-view mirror. "
30,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

36,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
37,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."
40,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33473038-heath-salzman,4,"Very interesting and important read. The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "
41,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22768978-brian-gee,4,"This is more of an introduction to the topic rather than a definitive thesis, however the author admits that additional research is needed, and this book should encourage us to push forward on that. That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

45,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
46,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
47,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
48,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
49,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
51,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
52,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
53,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
54,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
55,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
56,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
57,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
58,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
60,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

67,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

75,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
76,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
77,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
78,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
79,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary. "
80,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19809801-cynthia-nomanee,2,"After finishing this book, I had to struggle to understand what new knowledge I had gained into the human mind. The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
81,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
82,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
83,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
84,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
85,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
86,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
87,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
88,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."
89,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15174297-neil-white,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has been one of the most provocative voices on research on the autism spectrum and is responsible for two of the major frameworks that have been used to better understand autism spectrum disorders. In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
90,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

96,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
97,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

104,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40211330-christian,4,Great book. Fascinating subject and delivered expertly. He seems to have a legitimately open mind about investigating the issue.

105,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
106,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
107,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
108,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
109,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

110,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19809801-cynthia-nomanee,2,"After finishing this book, I had to struggle to understand what new knowledge I had gained into the human mind. The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
111,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
112,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
113,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
114,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
115,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
116,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
117,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."

Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."

While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

126,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
127,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."
130,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33473038-heath-salzman,4,"Very interesting and important read. The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

135,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
136,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
137,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
138,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
139,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
141,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
142,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
143,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
144,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
145,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
146,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."

The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."

Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
150,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

156,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
157,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

165,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
166,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
167,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."

(Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."

My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
171,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
172,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
173,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
174,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
175,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
176,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
177,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
178,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
180,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

187,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

195,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
196,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
197,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
198,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
199,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary. "
200,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19809801-cynthia-nomanee,2,"After finishing this book, I had to struggle to understand what new knowledge I had gained into the human mind. The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
201,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
202,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
203,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
204,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
205,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
206,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
207,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
208,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."
209,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15174297-neil-white,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has been one of the most provocative voices on research on the autism spectrum and is responsible for two of the major frameworks that have been used to better understand autism spectrum disorders. In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
210,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

217,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."
220,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33473038-heath-salzman,4,"Very interesting and important read. The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "
221,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22768978-brian-gee,4,"This is more of an introduction to the topic rather than a definitive thesis, however the author admits that additional research is needed, and this book should encourage us to push forward on that. That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

225,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
226,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
227,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
228,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
229,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

230,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19809801-cynthia-nomanee,2,"After finishing this book, I had to struggle to understand what new knowledge I had gained into the human mind. The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
231,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
232,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
233,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
234,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
235,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
236,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."

The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
238,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."
239,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15174297-neil-white,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has been one of the most provocative voices on research on the autism spectrum and is responsible for two of the major frameworks that have been used to better understand autism spectrum disorders. In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
240,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

246,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
247,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."
250,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33473038-heath-salzman,4,"Very interesting and important read. The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

255,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
256,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
257,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."
258,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has done some amazing work on autism and I’ve enjoyed reading a number of his articles in the past so decided to have a go with his 3rd book Zero Degrees Of Empathy, the subtitle being “A New Theory of Human Cruelty“. (Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."
259,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995068-philip,3,"As I'm a layperson on the subject matter, (psychology, not Evil- though I hope never to be more than an occasional amateur in that) I'm not able to adequately comment on the scientific or clinical aspects of this topic. My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner. Those caveats behind me I can now go on to my other critical feedback. I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
261,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
262,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
263,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
264,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
265,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
266,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."

The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."

Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."

In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
270,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2145361-diana,4,"Simon Baron-Cohen tells us that what we call ""evil"" is in reality a total lack of empathy, the result of either genetics, abuse, or both. Recently, I happened to catch on TV part of the current Casey Anthony trial. A forensics expert had been called to testify regarding insect activity present in the deceased child's body when found. While he was giving his testimony the camera panned to Ms. Anthony. Considering the graphic nature of the subject and the fact that the deceased was her own child, I was struck by her apparent total lack of emotion. (I might add that her guilt remains to be seen, I was just impressed by her lack of emotion.)The author relates some interesting case histories, discusses the degrees of lack of empathy, together with other antisocial traits, narcissism, etc. and the fact that some degree of detachment is required in certain professions i.e., doctors, scientists, engineers, etc. and, finally, sums up how we as nations and individuals can use empathy to resolve our conflicts.

I was really taken with the book, probably because of a reputable researcher presenting a very neat explanation of the human capacity to hurt.Unfortunately, once I actually did some very basic research into borderline personality disorder, I found that the way Cohen characterises this group of sufferers is very mainstream but highly at odds with DSM5 diagnosis system. Talking to a counselling psychologist who has treated people with diagnoses of borderline personality disorder was an eye-opener. This is not a group of people who are unempathic. If anything they are overwhelmed by other people's emotions.This basic fault, which is repeated time and time again, completely taints the book for me. I have read that Baron-Cohen's own research in to autism has been highly valuable. On personality disorders I can only assume that he is a tourist."

276,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12324968-robert-kaufman,4,"Good book, not overly technical or profound, but thought provoking. "
277,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Interesting and informative, without being inspiring or even fully coherent.Baron-Cohen sets out to explain 'evil' and human cruelty as a function of ""empathy erosion"" – whereby people become able to view and treat others as (mere) objects. He defines empathy as 
our ability to identify what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.
Having asserted that all people are located somewhere on an empathy bell-curve (from high-empathy individuals to low- or zero-empathy types), he has an interesting discussion of three personality disorders (borderline, psychopath and narcissist) which he defines as sharing a common feature – that of extremely compromised/diminished/non-existent empathy. He contrasts these types of ""zero negative"" empathy with the ""zero positive"" empathy of people with Asperger's Syndrome and some types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The discussion here is interesting but felt incomplete given the range of that spectrum.The guts of the book is built on an analysis of what he calls the brain’s ""empathy circuits"". Yes, he does get more technical than this, and no, I won't. Because I can't.Outlining experiments and observations of brain activity regarding the empathy circuits, he argues that the three ""zero empathy"" personality disorders all show impairment in the areas of the brain involved in empathy. As to why that is, and to what extent genetics plays a role, he comes down firmly – as you may well expect – on the side of ""both/and""... There is both a strong genetic component to the functioning of these parts of the brain for empathy and a significant contribution from a person's environment, particularly their early life and upbringing.Funnily enough, for such a weighty topic, I felt the book was a little light. And when Baron-Cohen delves (a little dismissively it must be said) into the realms of philosophy, sociology or theology, he is not particularly convincing. For example, a page-and-a-half of text and a single scholarly reference to dismiss Arendt's notion of the banality of evil seems scant, even in a work of popular psychology/psychiatry/neuroscience.In a very brief section right at the end of the book, he diagrams and discusses some of the ways that the ""empathy circuit"" can be ""compromised in its functioning"", including both individual and social factors, but really struggles to develop or affirm any theory about when, why, or how these forces are able to overwhelm what he sees as the innate empathy of most people. And, as much as I agree with the notion that empathy is an ""underutilised resource"", his hyper-optimistic conclusion sounds like it was written just moments after spinning John Lennon's ""Imagine"" on the turntable:Any problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble. It is effective as a way of anticipating and resolving interpersonal problems, whether this is a marital conflict, an international conflict, a problem at work, difficulties in a friendship, political deadlocks, a family dispute, or a problem with a neighbour. I hope you have been persuaded that this resource is a better way to resolve problems than the alternatives (such as guns, laws, or religion). And, unlike the arms industry that costs trillions of dollars to maintain, or the prison service and legal system that cost millions of dollars to keep oiled, empathy is free. And, unlike religion, empathy cannot, by definition, oppress anyone.Nothing in what he'd written up until this point had convinced me that I was required to choose between law or religion and empathy when it comes to addressing interpersonal or social problems, let alone that a thinly humanistic empathy is somehow better at dealing with social issues than any alternatives."

I can't say that he accomplished that , at least not fully. for example , He did explain  how  someone can do cruel things (by having no empathy) , but he fell short on explaining why someone would want to destroy and inflict damage on others in the first place.Finally and most importantly , I have issues with the implications of the opinions he presented in the final chapter. The science behind his theory leads to the idea that genetic and early environmental factors are mainly what leads people to cruelty (mild or extreme) and that those factors can do almost irreversible changes to the structure of the brain. The main implication of this idea is that cruel and ""evil"" people have no agency in what they do , and for the time being I wish not to fully accept that , I want to think that there is more to evil than just that.and because of the last point , the book serves as a step into this topic and many related ones as well like ""free will"" for example"

I don’t typically like science books, but because this was in a field I was familiar with (I have a degree in psychology) I did enjoy this. Conduct, anti-social, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders, in addition to empathy, are often glossed over in psychology classes, even abnormal psych in my experience, so it was interesting to read more about the topic."

The author draws on his extensive research into Autism Spectrum Disorder to examine the effects of empathy or the lack thereof. This books really gets into the brain science behind how the brain develops empathy and why folks do not have it. The authors thesis is that we should reframe the moral question of evil and instead think about it in terms of empathy or the lack of empathy. His conclusion is that we need to do all we can to become more empathetic, even to those who lack empathy. Great book from a secular perspective. I think the author was hoping to replace the need for religion with this thesis, but I amI convinced, especially as religions can tend to help people and groups cultivate empathy. At any rate, it was definitely worth reading. "

That said, in regards to things we aren't talking about but should be, this topic is pretty much on the top of that list, so I appreciate this book for attempting to start that conversation from a different and more empathetic perspective. As a society we need to both be able to identify those who could harm others sooner in order to protect society, but we also have to develop ways to treat those individuals humanely and with rehabilitation in mind wherever possible. This book offers important suggestions towards both of those goals."

285,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953971-edmole,4,"Simon Baron Cohen is a leading scientist and writer on how neurological variations affect behaviour and the mind. I read this as I had been fascinated hearing about the Sally Anne test http://www.educateautism.com/infograp...that Baron-Cohen devised when I was on a course about young people with autism. (He is also Sacha's cousin, and he gives his cuz brief but mad props in this book.)This book starts by looking at acts of 'evil' and concluding that they occur across cultures and across societal groups, and that acts of evil come from a deficit in the mind's construction. There is a fascinating breakdown of Type B (Borderline), Type P (Psychopaths) and Type N (Narcissists) behave, into how their lack of empathy links to their behaviour, and how the different areas of the brain behave in these different types. I try not to project myself into these sorts of things - it's crass to read about aspects of a behaviour or condition and over-identify with it; sure you might have aspects, but are you comparing a sprain with a broken leg? Sunburn with being set on fire? But I did see a lot of my push-pull neediness and ludicrous despair in the Borderline type. Baron-Cohen is pretty unequivocal in saying that the reduced ability to empathise with and relate to others as people (and not objects) is strongly linked to a lack of love and care in early childhood, referring often to an 'internal pot of gold' developed by being loving, engaged and supportive to children in their early childhood. He makes a very interesting distinction with people on the autistic spectrum that while they struggle to empathise cognitively with others as they do not necessarily perceive signs of upset from e.g. facial expression, they will empathise and be concerned and upset when they learn someone is unhappy (affectively).There is a huge amount of fascinating and useful info in this book, and I admire Baron-Cohen's drive to step back from philosophical debates about the drivers or relative morality of evil acts. Instead, he proposes that we need to recognise the absence of empathy as an issue in itself, one that can be addressed with support and love for everyone, and sympathy and empathy with other people and cultures. I tend to believe that we have to address behaviour as a thing in itself, which must be judged and acted upon in relation to its effect on others. But it was good, expanding and enlightening to read this equal parts passionate and detached book giving another perspective. This does not mean, of course, that I forgive any act done against me, and I say again now, I will destroy my enemies, and if my friends try and stop me, they too will be crushed. I will forgive when there are no more to forgive me. I know I will be betrayed, and I know who will betray me."
286,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113498360-lucy-caston,4,"I really enjoyed this book, I think mainly because I’m so interested in studying scientific perspectives on topics that I have previously learnt philosophically. In this case, it is the problem of evil. Simon Baron-Cohen explains that the aim for the book is to re-stimulate discussions on the causes of evil, by moving the debate out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science. He does this by exploring the human empathy circuit, arguing that zero degrees of empathy may account for ‘evil’ acts. The most interesting part of this book for me, is the recurring (and ‘alarming’) theme of determinism. In Chapter 5, Baron-Cohen examines evidence that some genes are associated with empathy. This suggests we could predict the moral development of an individual. I think the implications of this are huge; thus it is something I find fascinating. On the nurture side, in Chapter 3, he explains that the security of early attachment between an infant and his/her caregiver predicts their moral development to a great extent. I like how he uses Bowlby’s remarkable concept of an ‘internal pot of gold’, to describe early secure attachment, suggesting that when we fail to nurture young children we damage them almost irreversibly. I found this thought-provoking and I think for some, controversial because it potentially defers moral responsibility onto someone else.Baron-Cohen writes about ‘rethinking psychiatry’. He argues the psychiatric system is ‘crying out’ for a category called ‘Empathy Disorders’. I again found this fascinating, as it highlights the implications of classing zero degrees of empathy as a neurological disability: it gets ‘tangled up’ with the free will debate. I think it would have been interesting for Baron-Cohen to discuss the societal implications of this; how would we objectify and quantify points on the empathy spectrum in a fair and universal way? This is also interesting for the implications on our justice system. I’ve read some reviews saying this book is too repetitive, but I think reading all the way through the hypotheses is definitely worth it for the final chapter ‘Reflections on Human Cruelty’. It also builds on his previous book ‘The Essential Difference’ by explaining the systemising/empathising spectrums; which I similarly enjoyed, especially as he again looks into the roots of autism spectrum conditions."
287,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684778-khrome,3,"This book started off as a solid four stars for me. I liked Baron-Cohen's ideas on empathy, especially defining it as a two-step process - identifying another's emotions and responding appropriately, the idea that empathy levels can be charted on a bell curve, and that we are confined to our own range of empathy levels but free to move within it. I thought he was on the right path with looking for physiological proof of empathy levels in what he calls the ""empathic circuit"" of the brain. But he started to lose me when he brought up his own Empathy Quotient test as a means to measure empathy. I took the test and, as I have the tendency do with all tests, started reverse engineering it. There are some big causality vs correlation issues, in my opinion. He mentions, at least on an online site, that it's not very accurate, so I question why he bothered to include it at all. The last half of the book deals with his own personal views on the importance of the study of empathy. He brings up good points in using the results of such studies to change policies in the areas of law and psychiatry. Lastly, he expressed the need for everyone to be more empathetic. I think this is an unrealistic request as the ones who really need to be more empathetic (people at the low end of the bell curve) are the ones who are likely to not care. They are also probably least likely to read this book. The ones who are willing to change are probably already mid to high empathy people. There is hardly any mention of what can happen when one is at the high end of the bell curve. I know a couple of people that are so empathetic that they are stressed out, anxious, and physically unhealthy, putting others before themselves all the time. A balance is what is needed, and is what should have been conveyed, IMO. By the end, I felt it was more of a three-star book. I would have liked to read more about brain imaging research and how it ties into personality disorders, and less of his agenda. His writing style also changed in the middle of the book which I found disjointing. Regardless, there are still good ideas and content in this book, at least to my layman knowledge. I hope it accomplishes what I think he set out to do, which is to motivate researchers in their respective fields of study to find evidence to support his theories."

(Part of a series of posts on ‘evil’.)He starts with saying evil is a pointless concept; he wants to replace this with a lack of empathy. “If I have an agenda it is to urge people not to be satisfied with the word ‘evil’ as an explanatory tool, and, if I have moved the debate out of the domain of religion and into the social and biological sciences, I will feel this book has made a contribution.”He defines empathy as follows:“Empathy occurs when we suspend our single-minded focus of attention, and instead adopt a double-minded focus of attention. Empathy is our ability to identity what someone else is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their thoughts and feelings with an appropriate emotion.”His ParadigmHe defines levels of empathy from 0 to 6, where people at 0 cannot understand the mind of others and people at 6 are super empathisers. He splits level 0 into the categories of negative and positive zero empathy.Kinds of negative zero empathy include the psychopath, the narcissist and the borderline and he describes in detail the sort of nasty things they can do and gets into their mindset so we can understand why. He says that while these so-called personality disorders have long been classified and discussed, his is a new paradigm in which to classify and diagnose them and hence more helpfully deal with them. (I think the way we classify “abnormal” behaviour is usually not very helpful as these classifications can become ends in themselves rather than simply targets of understanding. BC adds himself to the list of people that find the DSM limited and often counter productive.)He then considers positive zero empathy, i.e. those that don’t hurt other people, so people with Aspergers / autism and looks at the difficulties and advantages of conditions in the spectrum. He says that although they have empathy difficulties, they “are often strong systemizers which can be remarkably positive“.rest of the review is here: http://unfebuckinglievable.wordpress...."

My most critical negative comment, however, is that this was what is precisely lacking here. The title presents the subject matter as 'Science of...' but the content was superficial. I appreciated the author's many assertions, and his theory, but I would have liked to see more evidence. I recall that he only cited one original clinical study, and there wasn't enough hard evidence. More investigation is needed, and should be cited. This is not a book for the practitioner.

I largely agree with the framework the author presented for the basis of Evil being the lack of Empathy, in humans, and I believe that Evil is a human construct. I am an atheist who believed that Evil was in some way ignorance, a misdirection that could be carefully remedied through compassionate, persistent care by others. Evil, for me was a ghost, until like millions of others I witnessed the atrocities of the late 20th century. I remain an atheist, but I believe in Evil now, and this is what attracted me to this book. Was there a way to reconcile my ethical judgements and resentments of the actions of many fellow human beings with my humanistic perspective? Was there a solution here for one such as myself, adrift in the universe with only my firm belief in the scientific method to guide me?Perhaps there is, but I want to see more clinical investigation to support this author's theory, this book is a start, and I hope we will see more in a future edition. I genuinely hope he will pursue his interest in this subject and will share his findings. I would like to see some peer reviewed science that is funded by scientific bodies without a biased point of view. There was a lot of social commentary here, and there was a lot of opinion that could have been presented as an appendix. 3 stars, I enjoyed it, but it was television when I wanted a carefully planned and executed documentary.

The answer quickly turned out to be not much.While there were certainly interesting concepts and anecdotes, the information wasn't anything...I expected? I guess I expected a real peak into why we do things we do. Why certain people turn out the way they do. The most certain answer I received from this book was that it's a mixture of nurture and nature. Um...duh?I liked the Empathy Quotient, the Empathy Bell Curve, and the zero type negatives and positives. But I still didn't get an answer as to what a psychopath really is, what to do with psychopaths, why ""regular"" people can commit terrible crimes, where prejudice comes from, hate, etc. I didn't really receive answers. At one point, he even (possibly unintentionally) separates empathy and morality (Table 1 on page 154). What's the difference? Then could people with a lack of empathy have morals? What does that mean? And what about those serial killers who have shown remorse after each crime committed but still continue to commit crimes? The ones that allegedly ""can't help it""? What about those who commit crimes in the belief of righteousness? What about wars and soldiers? Am I to really believe this could all be explained by a ""spectrum of empathy""?I finally realized why hadn't felt fulfilled with this book when I tried to take the empathy quotient in the end. The statements were so ambiguous and the expected answers obvious. Could I not fake my answers even if I had no empathy? And for some of the situations created by the test, it honestly depended for me. I generally don't like making new friends so what would I say for #7 on the quotient? This wasn't science. This was a personality test.I don't mind him interjecting his opinions now and then but that's all it felt like, especially towards the end. He truly believes empathy is one of the most valuable resources in our world and that people can change. While that makes me smile, I also feel that it's quite naïve and incredibly simplistic. It's also unscientific. I expected science. I expected reasons and answers. Instead, I felt I got entertaining theories and glossy opinions."
291,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33076201-881,1,"I wish I can give this book negative 5 stars. It's subjective and weakly supported and overall a mess of a book. Don't bother with it. I DNF this book. It is incredibly bias and lumps up people into categories without considering their other qualities. He doesn't see ""people"" he sees ""a psychopath"" ""a borderline"" and ""a narcissist."" He might be more reliable about what he says about Autism, but he has very weak understanding and knowledge of personality disorders. He basically makes these weird categories ""negative zero/positive zero etc"" which not only sound dumb, but are not quantified anywhere. I researched these categories, and nada. So who is to judge empathy then? who are you to lump people into black and white categories based on stereotypes and slap some weak research findings onto them. He picks bias research, doesn't make objective and well supported arguments. In fact he mostly uses specific situations and pathos, and to make things worst, he doesn't address the main topic: the science of evil. Having no empathy does NOT mean you are evil, it does NOT mean that you are socially inept, and it does NOT automatically result in you being a criminal or aggressive. The book repeats it self, and is quiet disorganized and lacks clarity. His views are black and white, yet he says disorders are spectrums, but then he says that Cluster B disorders have NEGATIVE ZERO empathy! FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T SAY ZERO NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, IT IS JUST STUPID AND SHOWS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A SIMPLE CONCEPT OF A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS A BASELINE OR THE ABSENCE OF SOMETHING. This whole book could be summed in a couple of condensed pages.Also measuring empathy objectively is nearly impossible. Using one test to quantify empathy lacks scientific ground. A couple of things about research you must consider: -Validity-- Is the instrument we are using to measure, is actually accuretly measuring what we want to measure?- reliability-- Internal reliability is a measure of how well your test is actually measuring what you want it to measure. External reliability means that your test or measure can be generalized beyond what you’re using it for.Considering these 2, it is clear to me that this book is not a good source of info. "
292,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158571-andrew,5,"This is really an amazing book, maybe the best cognitive science book I've read this year. Baron-Cohen starts with a pretty simple premise on evil: that evil should be viewed not from the traditional Judeo-Christian definition or the modern western judicial definition, but rather as a failure of human empathy. From that point on, he discusses evil very little, and gives the reader a fascinating study of human empathy, and in so doing he writes a very moving case for why empathy is likely the most important human trait we possess. Baron-Cohen argues convincingly that human beings as a whole experience empathy on a spectrum, from very high to very low, with most people falling somewhere in the middle, and very few people falling at the extremes. At the negative extreme (which he calls Zero-negative) are people we classify as psychopaths, and at the other extreme are those rare people who feel empathy in such extreme degree that they virtually give their lives over to the well-being of others. He gives Bishop Desmond Tutu as an example of this kind of modern saint. Baron-Cohen also discusses in detail people he terms 'Zero-positive', people who are incapable of experiencing empathy because they suffer from conditions like autism and Asberger's, but who tend not to be violent and who can often use their conditions to make a positive contribution to society. Maybe the most fascinating part of the book is Baron-Cohen's discussion of the most recent brain and genetic studies available on empathy. Having done many of these himself with various colleagues, he identifies specific genes that have been found to play a crucial role in how people experience (or don't experience) empathy, and he makes a lot of well-backed claims on what this might mean for the empirical study of empathy as a universal human trait. He draws equally on the years he's spent working in a clinical setting, so the reader here gets a very rare mix of touching anecdotal stories of actual patients and cutting-edge cognitive science. The book is short and very readable, and I really can't recommend it enough. "
293,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"Baron-Cohen (cousin of Sasha) is a professor of developmental psychopathology, specializing in autism research. He wrote this book to suggest that the scientists shouldn’t leave evil to the theologians; that much of it could be researched and quantified. Often using machines that go ping! I think he’s right about that. People with certain disorders that damage their ability to have empathy for others (psychopathic, narcissistic and borderline personality disorders specifically) are overrepresented in prisons, while those on the autism spectrum aren’t. So it’s not just lack of empathy that drives criminal behavior. Prof. Baron-Cohen suggests that the difference comes from the fact that those on the autism spectrum develop systems to understand the world, which leads to codes of behavior; those in the unholy trinity of P/N/B don’t. My mind goes to Dexter Morgan. And Batman. But as the book forthrightly acknowledges, it doesn’t deal with evil on a national level; the sort of horrific cruelties an individual can commit as part of communal exercise – like forcing parents to kill their own children, or men in the death camps being forced to put the noose around their friends necks -- then go home and be kind to their own children. There’s no real answer offered to Eichmann in Jerusalem. Or how a doctor in Utah (who he singles out) could put a target on the body of a man tied to a chair for five volunteer members of a firing squad to shoot at. Having done some death penalty work in my time, I’m struck that juries in my state tend to give mercy when the defendant asks for it, and offers some reasons for it. Maybe that gives the jury, even a death qualified one, the opportunity to develop empathy. Not sure how that works in other states. He suggests that we could reduce the violence in the world if we were all more empathetic. Well . . . maybe. Individual on individual violence? Sure. But as long as violence is a way systems enforce themselves, it’s gonna be used. A quick read – I read it in one sitting – with a nice empathy test in the back and some tips for spotting other people’s personality disorders. "
294,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764360-joachim,4,"This is one of the books where I idly hovered over the rating field and could not make up my mind, whether to give is three stars, our four. (Just FYI: I very rarely give five stars). In the end I gave it four. Why I was tempted to give it “only” three stars? Well, while I find his approach interesting (evil not as a function but as a result of the absence of something else), many of his ideas stroke me as too simplistic. One of them is the empathy quotient as a predictor for empathic shortcomings. I for example scored very low on his empathy test with the diagnosis of Aspergers, while standardised Aspergers tests (and all the people around me) diagnose me as being neurotypical. When I looked at why I got such a low rating it turned out that many answers relied on the judgement of other people, so if you live in a culture where it is not appropriate to pass such judgements about each other, one cannot answer such questions in the affirmative, and one is thus in danger of being diagnosed as being inflicted with Aspergers.So why do I gave four stars then? Well, first, it's a very clearly written book, and given the complexity of the subject matter, this is a feat in itself. Second, it is a short book. How often have I been reading very enlightening books that went on and on, without any apparent reason. I am just awed at this vogue of 500+ pages as a standard length for non-fictional books. Last, but not least, even where I thin Baron-Cohen is outright wrong (see above) I still find his ideas interesting and fruitful. Stimulating is an even more appropriate way of putting it. So for me the factual accuracy of this book is actually trumped by the fact that Baron-Cohen stimulated many a new thought and also provided a fresh look at the question of evil.If you are looking for such kind of stimulation then this is indeed the right book for you."
295,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"I found this book to be a little disingenuous. Baron-Cohen starts the book by arguing that our concept of evil offers no explanation for the horrors that man has unleash against our own kind, from the ovens of the Holocaust to the modern genocides and ethnic cleansings, and he claims to try to give a more scientific explanation for these events. He then starts a discussion on what he believes to be key aspect in understanding “evil” actions, the concept of empathy. He goes on to describe in strict anatomical detail how empathy arises and functions in healthy adults. He subsequently deals at length with those who seem to lack empathy, ranging from those with personality disorders to those clinically labeled as psychopaths, and the abnormalities of their neural anatomy. It is only at the end of the book that he returns to the problem presented at the beginning, that of massive cruelty and “evil”, and briefly acknowledges that it is not possible to classify everyone who participated in these atrocities as psychopaths or as suffering from personality disorders but that it is still possible to claim that they all seem to momentarily lack empathy. I was very frustrated by this approach since all it really explains is the origin of psychological disorders that make people unable to empathize with anyone while ignoring otherwise normal people that can mercilessly kill someone they object to (Jewish people, members of different ethnic populations) and then come home to be a loving father and husband. It is this banality of evil that I was trying to understand, a deeper explanation for what Philip Zimbardo recounts in “The Lucifer Effect”, i.e., how good people turn bad. This book seems merely a book about the neurological abnormalities that result in lack of empathy while ignoring the source of most of the world’s “evil” actions. "
296,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217904-melanie-baker,5,"This book is admittedly snack-sized, especially considering the depth and complexity of the topic, but I appreciate how approachable Baron-Cohen makes the subject matter, and how he provokes one's own thoughts.Basically, a book about evil that's more about the opposite of evil: empathy. And, especially, what the spectrum of empathy looks like in humans, and what results when it's absent. As with many psychological issues, mental illnesses, and other conditions these says, it's all, as aforementioned, about the spectrum. Or seven levels of empathy. There is also a consideration of positive vs. negative lack of empathy, which seems odd to begin with -- how could a lack of empathy ever be good? -- but then he goes on to explain the autism spectrum as it relates to empathy. And one would think Baron-Cohen knows a thing or two about autism. :)I imagine for anyone in the mental health profession, this book would seem a bit pop culture-y and simplistic, but I think it's a good introduction to some ideas, and a basic primer to learn more. It also shares some fascinating theories, like the one that anorexia may partly be a form of autism (which is interesting to consider, and would certainly affect treatment protocol). At the end of the book, it also dips into humanitarian issues. After all, there are people in the world who lack empathy, and who have committed heinous crimes. There are people who think such criminals are permanently ""evil"" and should be executed, and there are those who think it's possible to successfully treat and change such people, i.e. not everyone who has killed is guaranteed to do it again.All in all, a quick read and well recommended, as much for how it gets you thinking and imagining your own ideas as for how it gets you chewing on his."
297,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4860918-ishmael-seaward,4,"The word ""evil"" is a label we attach to people who do bad things. That doesn't mean we really understand what is going on. The author is quite specific in what he wants to accomplish: Stop talking about evil, which can't be defined or measured, and talk about empathy (or the lack thereof). Empathy can be measured; this is supported by years of research. With the advent of fMRI, parts of the brain can be identified that are involved in empathy. There are 10, and the author describes each one, where it is located, what it does, and therefore what it contributes to the empathic circuit.He presents the bell curve of empathy, which is well researched and documented, and then discusses where people fit on the curve and their behavior patterns. He establishes a very strong correlation between behavior we call ""evil"" (pyschopathic behavior), the position on the bell curve, and the areas of the empathic circuit that don't function well. In short, Baron-Cohen has moved the concept of evil out of the realm of religion and into the realm of science.I especially like that he mentions the people he has collaborated with, or whose results he has used, giving them full credit for their contribution. Some of these researchers I recognize from other books and articles. The author also identifies the gaps in the research as he takes the reader through the development of his thesis. Last but not least, the list of references is both broad and deep, ranging from Daniel Dennett to Takahashi et al., for a total of 385; the book is only 186 pages of text.I can't say that the book is ground-breaking, but it certainly pulls together multiple strands of research to form a coherent theory of ""empathy erosion"" and how it explains the behavior of people we call ""evil"". I found it very readable."
298,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"This is an excellent survey of research current at the time of writing on the mechanisms that lead some people to act with cruelty and others not. Baron Cohen focuses on lack of empathy as being the underlying reason why many people act in such ways. He suggests that this is a much more useful way to approach all types of cruel behavior, rather than labeling various sorts of personality disorder such as psychopath, borderline personality disorder or narcissist. Empathy is made up of two main components: the ability to recognise emotional states in others (cognition) and a separate ability to respond appropriately (affect). People on the autism/Asbergers spectrum have low empathy scores, but are very high on systemising behavior which can lead to remarkable creative outcomes eg in raisins, activists, researchers.He offers a matrix of positive and negative empathy, broken into its cognitive and affective aspects, and systemising. This makes clear the commonalities and the differences between the four labelled conditions tht he discusses in this book. Baron Cohen identifies 10 different brain circuits that control different elements in the complex set of reactions that contribute to the attribute we call empathy, acknowledging that research in many of these areas is still in its early stages and at the same time flagging potential questions and ethical issues. He writes with such fluency it is easy to discount the weight of his evidence and his argument. His easy style makes a great range of complex scientific research readily available to a general interested reader."
299,0713997915,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15174297-neil-white,3,"Simon Baron-Cohen has been one of the most provocative voices on research on the autism spectrum and is responsible for two of the major frameworks that have been used to better understand autism spectrum disorders. In this work he approaches a broader psychological spectrum to make the suggestion that empathy erosion is a scientific way to approach the question of interpersonal evil. The work is more suggestive than definitive, but his proposal is intriguing even if it doesn't answer all the questions that his proposal brings and he freely admits there is much more research to do. His work dealing with borderline, narcissistic and psychopathic (or anti-social disorder) as zero-negative empathy types compared to Asperger's syndrome as a zero-positive is an interesting way of approaching why the former often cause damage to others without any sense of remorse while the latter which also struggles with empathy recognition does not. The work pulls together a lot of psychological and child development research and even though I'm not sure I can agree with the author's conclusion in total, especially since he doesn't address except in passing at the end about how ordinary people commit incredibly destructive acts (and he argues that they in various ways have their empathy impaired)but the genetic and brain research he is able to point to about empathy centers in the brain as well as the developmental research is suggestive of where further development both scientifically and ethically needs to be done."
