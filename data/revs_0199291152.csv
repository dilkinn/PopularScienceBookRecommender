I do not believe in a God, certainly not any God that's been conceived by man, but I also believe Richard Dawkins is a self-satisfied thought-Nazi who is as fundamental in his view of religion as any right-wing minister. Fundamentalists of all faiths scare me, and atheism is just as much a faith as any religion. The existence or non-existence of a God cannot be proven, nor can the existence or non-existence of a soul, and faith is an abstract experience with implications that are fundamentally unresponsive to study. As such, pursuits like Dawkins' often boil down to one type of faith (in ""reason"") vs. another type of faith (in a ""God""). Many people love Dawkins. He is certainly intelligent, and writes as such, but he lacks wisdom and imagination. To me, that's the flaw in all of his work, from The Selfish Gene to The God Delusion. The idea that one human being can know enough about the nature of the universe to make the sweeping declarations Dawkins' makes is preposterous to me, and no more credible than the sweeping declarations of Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson.NC"

I'm agnostic myself, so I'm impartial, but Dawkins is so cynical, so against the idea that there is more to us as individual human beings than just intelligent apes meant to give birth, grow old and die, that he seems almost, for lack of a better phrase, sociopathic or antisocial. He leaves very little room for the profound depths of emotion, companionship, imagination, nostalgia or anything that goes against his view that we are just materialistic monkeys who won't matter to anyone a hundred years from now. I found him as a narrator of this book to be rather obnoxious and appalling, and I don't think he understands just how unique our minds and meanings to one another really are. I don't think we are divine beings, but I don't think we are just animals, either. I think there's more to the human race than that. I'm not talking about religion, I'm talking about humanity. This book tries to prove a point, but portrays humans as consuming, greedy, sex maniac gorillas who only exist to reproduce. Perhaps that is true in some ways, but not all humans are alike and to generalize them in this manner leaves no room for anything beyond Dawkins' view of logic. I think he's very full of himself, convinced he has all the answers, and the truth is nobody knows everything about the world and the only thing selfish about The Selfish Gene is the author himself, who seems to pride himself on putting down anyone who doesn't share his values."
3,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148633-brian-hodges,4,"Although I consider myself a Jesus-loving, god-fearing, creationist, I simply LOVE reading about evolution. I'm not sure what it is, but I find the whole concept, when explained by a lucid and accessible author, fascinating. And Dawkins is nothing if not lucid and accessible. He presents the topic and various questions and scientific controversies in a way that anybody with a willingness to pay attention can follow it. Some of the chapters were a bit more of a slog as Dawkins has to resort to scary scary math and numbers to prove some of his points and set up for even more mindblowing stuff in future chapters. But most of the time, this book is chock full of insanely interesting examples and user-friendly analogies. Dawkins sure knows his way around language too. One of my favorite lines is: ""Sex: that bizarre perversion of straightforward replication.""On the science of it all, as I said, I'm a creationist, but I like to read up on the other side and at least understand, if not appreciate, what their take on the matter is. And to read Dawkins is to realize, yes, this does sound like a very solid theory. My one stumbling block to getting onto the evolution train one hundred percent is time. Perhaps my comprehension of just how long hundred million years is is faulty, but I just can't wrap my mind around how all of these ACCIDENTAL mutations, with no conscious will on the part of the group, individual or gene itself, could possibly result in the complexity of life as we see it now. There is an adage that if you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time, they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. To believe evolution is to believe that you now have a FINITE amount of monkeys and a FINITE amount of time and yet they STILL manage to produce the complete works of Shakespeare... and they do it OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Just doesn't seem plausible. But perhaps further reading will sway me at a later date.EDIT 6/3/15I can't believe this review is still getting attention after all this time! And I love the thread that has developed in the comments. I should let you all know though that as of 2008 I have been living on the side of reason and rationality. I became an atheist after a LOT of reading and contemplating of the Bible (the link to my ""de-conversion"" story is down in the comments as well). I try these days to, as much as possible, follow the evidence wherever it leads. Additionally Dawkins' ""The Ancestor's Tale"" was one of THE most beautiful books I've ever read. Check out my review if you're interested."

One of them as a uni professor advising a student to burn down the book store where they bought this book. Then we have the creationists, then the person who thinks it is all a capitalist manifesto. There are those who think he is arrogant, depraved, uses philistine language (!) ... How can anyone be a creationist and not believe in dinosaurs and such? Do they believe that the earth is flat? Are they the sort of people who pay astrologers money to cast their charts because of course your fate is determined by the stars at the moment of your birth? Jesus wept. Or he would have. I'm reading Josephus at the moment, it seems that the only mention of Jesus at the time he was living was in Josephus but that it might have been added later... That's a whole other story, and one which Dawkins might have liked, but these one-star creationists certainly won't."
5,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"I read the 30th anniversary edition of this book--it is a true ""classic"". I note that there are over 48,000 ratings and 1,400 reviews of this book on Goodreads! Richard Dawkins put an entirely original slant on Darwin's theory of natural selection. The book has turned people around, to the understanding that the gene plays the single most central role in natural selection, rather than the individual organism. Over the course of generations, evolution plays a role to ensure the survival of the genes, not the individual or ""the species"".Although the book is 30 years old, it has stood the test of time. There are a few passages--primarily about computers--that are 30 years out of date. But the vast majority of the book seems to have held up quite well.Dawkins' prose is very approachable by the layman. There is a bare minimum of technical jargon--quite different from most other books about genetics that I've been reading in recent years. Dawkins takes the time to explain things, often with appropriate metaphors. There are very few diagrams in the book--additional figures could help clarify some points, in my opinion.Much of the book is really about the role of game theory, in understanding genetics. Dawkins devotes several chapters to describe how various traits controlled by genes are held in an ESS-- ""Evolutionarily Stable Strategy""--a term that Dawkins uses quite often, that I think is a synonym for the game theory term ""stable equilibrium"". Dawkins shows how an ESS is approached over the course of ""iterations"" of a game, that is to same, over many generations. These chapters were especially interesting to me, as I recently took an online course on the subject of game theory.It is in this book that Dawkins coined the now-famous term ""meme"". The meme is a cultural analog of the biological gene. A meme seeks to self-perpetuate, and mutates if that aids its self-preservation. Dawkins devotes an entire fascinating chapter to his concept of the meme.Throughout the book, Dawkins deals with the dichotomy between the ""selfishness"" required for survival, and the ""altruism"" of human behavior. How do we explain altruism? Dawkins explores this dilemma over and over again, showing in virtually every case how the selfishness of genes can help to explain apparent altruistic behavior of the individual. This is an absolutely fascinating book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in genetics, evolution, or sociology. "
6,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Color me very impressed. I can now see why this is considered to be one of those hugely popular science books I keep hearing about and the reason why Dawkins has become so widely known and/or respected with or without his notoriety.Indeed, the pure science bits were pretty much awesome. We, or at least I, have heard of this theory in other contexts before and none of it really comes as much surprise to see that genes, themselves, have evolved strategies that are exactly the same as Game Theory in order to find the best possible outcome for continued replication. Hence: the selfish gene.Enormous simple computers running through the prisoner's dilemma with each other, rival genes, and especially within whole organisms which could just be seen as gigantic living spacecraft giving the genes an evolutionary advantage of finding new and more prosperous adaptations. Yup! That's us!I honestly don't see the problem. I love the idea that we are just galaxies of little robots running complicated Game Theories that eventually turn into a great cooperative machine where everyone (mostly) benefits, with plenty of complicated moves going way beyond hawks and doves and straight into the horribly complicated multi-defectors, forgivers, and other evolutionary styles that depend on the events that have gone before and the pre-knowledge (or lack of) a set end-date for the entire experiment... in other words, our deaths, whether pre-planned or simply the entire mass of genes just coming to realize that it's no longer in their best interest to keep pushing this jalopy around any longer if they're not getting anything out of it... like further replication. :)Even when it's not precisely sex, it's still all about sex. :)Of course, what I've just mentioned isn't the entire book, because, as a matter of fact, the book walks us through so many stages of thought, previous research, developments, mistakes, and upgraded theories and surprising conclusions based on soooooo much observable data that any of us might be rightfully confounded with the weight of it unless we were in the heart of the research, ourselves.It's science, baby.Make sure you don't make the data conform to your theory. Build your theory from observable data. Improve upon it as the building blocks are proved or disproved, keep going until it is so damn robust until nothing but a true miracle could topple it, and then keep asking new questions.The fact is, this theory has nothing (or everything) to do with our lives. We play Game Theory, too, in exactly the same way every gene everywhere does, but we just happen to be able to make models on top of the situations and we're able to choose whether to see through the lies, the hawk strategies, or when to stop cooperating if the advantages work out much better for us if we did. We, like our genes, can choose long-term cooperative strategies or play everything like a Bear market. :)Even this book says that it's very likely that Nice Guys can win, but just like our lives, the gene lives keep discovering ever more complicated strategies and all eventual strategies become more and more situational. Isn't that us, to a tea? I wonder if most complaints about this book stem from complaints about Game Theory rather than the perceived conclusion (much better spelled out, not in this book, but in later books)... that atheism rules the day. It really isn't evident here. Instead, we have a macrocosm mimicking the microcosm and no one wants to challenge their comfortable world view. Things aren't simple. All choices to betray or cooperate are then met with situation and memory and ever complex meta-contexts, the difference between us and genes being that we're self-aware and the genes are not.Yes, yes, I see where the arguments can start coming out of the closet about self-determination and such, but that's not really the point of this book at all. The point is that it's a successful model that accurately describes reality. It has nothing at all to do with the macro-world except obliquely, and makes no value judgments on our art, our beliefs, or how we think about ourselves except in our uniquely stubborn and self-delusional ways that love to take things out of context and apply misunderstood concepts to our general lives and wonder why everything gets so screwed up. :)But then, maybe I'm just applying my own incomplete models to yet another and we lousy humans still lack WAY TOO MUCH data to build a really impressively improved model. :) Come on, Deep Thought. Where are you? :)"
7,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,5,"Richard Dawkin's 1976 classic game changer The Selfish Gene contains information I still didn't know, almost 40 years later. His basic idea is that the essential unit of life is the gene; our bodies are just big fleshy protection robots for the gene. Dawkins says I'm a tool. Right? High five!And you might be like ""Okay, so who cares?"" What difference does that make, right? Well, first of all I'm gonna go have some pie because fuck you, genes, you're not the boss of me. Woohoo! Other than that, no, no difference, carry on. It makes a difference to scientists, because when you look at it this way all kinds of behaviors make more sense, or make sense in a different way. Dawkins' particular focus is on behaviors we call ""altruistic"", like when an antelope warns his herd about an approaching lion. Dawkins would like to go through every altruistic behavior he can think of, which is a lot, and show you why it's actually not at all altruistic. (The antelope is an easy one: he warns the herd by jumping up and down, which doubles as a sign to the lion that he is super bouncy and the lion should go chase someone less bouncy.)So, no big surprise to those of us who know Dawkins in his latest incarnation as The World's Dickishest Atheist:* Dawkins does a lot of party pooping in this book. Did you think you were a nice guy? You are not. Your genes command you to behave nicely on occasion because in the end it will benefit you. (See: the Prisoner's Dilemma; also game theory. Or read this book, which will explain both to you.)* which is more annoying to religious people, but also annoying to those of us who are atheists but don't feel the need to yell about it all the timeBut Dawkins is also just a tremendously engaging writer. He's wildly good at explaining technical concepts clearly to lay idiots like me. And he's funny! This book is fun to read. And it's chock full of the kind of fascinating tidbits that make you turn to your spouse and say ""Holy moley, did you know saddleback birds on an island in New Zealand make up new songs that then spread through the population like a Pharrell Williams single until everyone's singing them?"" And she's like ""Sounds boring! I'm reading Jezebel, did you know Justin Bieber was racist when he was fourteen?"" and then the two of you look at each other like who even are you? And your genes are like who cares, you two should make out."
8,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,5,"On 27 December 1831, a young naturalist by the name of Charles Robert Darwin set upon a voyage of discovery on the HMS Beagle which was to last five years and take him all over the globe. He came back with a lot of specimens, copious scientific notes and an explosive theory which was to rock the world of ideas: the theory of evolution by natural selection. Suddenly, God became an unnecessary and unlikely hypothesis: man was pulled down from his high throne as the master of creation: and existence became a cacophony of chance events rather than a carefully co-ordinated orchestra. Naturally, the religious establishment rebelled. But like all ideas whose time had come, evolution hung on with great tenacity to become the widely accepted idea it is today.I have been fascinated with the idea ever since I was introduced to it in high school. As far as I am concerned, the very argument that theists put forward against evolution is its greatest strength; viz. the complexity of the natural world. According to the believer, such a complex and “perfect” (whatever that means!) system has to have an architect behind it. But the fact is that it is not “perfect” – nature is dynamic. What we perceive as stability is homeostasis, a seething mass of life, eating one another and being eaten; and as nature shifts her stance, so does life, whole species dying out (like the dinosaurs) to make way for others.But wait! Humans are different, aren’t we? We compete, true: but we also show altruism. People lay down their life to protect their progeny, their brothers and sisters, their countrymen… if we were selfish survival machines, why would we do this? It means we have the spark of divinity within us, doesn’t it?Well… not exactly, according to Richard Dawkins. It only means we have the “Selfish Gene” within us.The Selfish Gene needs no introduction. This is one of those iconic “pop” science books which everyone seems to have read, like The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris. I was a bit late (well, about 37 years!) in getting to it. However, the book has lost none of the charm, and the idea any of its power, due to the ravages of time: if at all, it has become stronger.What is a gene?Dawkins confesses that there is no universally agreed definition of ‘gene’. We now know that the blueprint for building of each human being is coded in 23 pairs of chromosomes, one of every pair being inherited from each parent. The code inside the chromosome is written in DNA molecules, the famous ‘Double Helix’ that Dawkins terms the ‘Immortal Coils’.The DNA molecules are replicators. They replicate themselves; they also manufacture proteins, the basic building block of life as we know it. These DNA molecules (some version of them) were the original “life” in the “primeval soup”: they reproduced themselves and competed with one another to survive. Natural selection defined which lasted and which died away.Dawkins defines a gene (a definition borrowed from G. C. Williams) as “any part of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection”. In other words, a gene is a copier with high “copying-fidelity”: that is, it ensures that it copies itself without mistakes so that longevity in the form of copies is ensured.So in the primeval soup, these genes went on happily competing with each other, evolving newer and newer ways of surviving in an environment which got increasingly complex. As part of survival technology, the genes built a lot of machines, bunching together to form gene complexes in the context. The machines got more and more complex, from the single-cell amoeba to the human being.Dawkins starts the book with the question “Why are people?” This is his answer – so that the gene can survive and replicate. We are nothing but vehicles for the genes, who exist to ensure their survival.Pretty disillusioning, isn’t it? But Dawkins is far from done. After pulling down humanity from its pedestal as the “pinnacle of creation”, he proceeds to explain all the lofty sentiments such as love, altruism, sacrifice etc. as the result of strategies for gene survival – extremely selfish strategies at that. It is very difficult to stomach for a generation which has been trained to behold human beings as somehow special, and the above sentiments as the proof of their exclusivity which separate them from the “lower” animals. As one disgusted poster said in one of the fora where this book was discussed: “So altruism is like going to the potty? Oh dear!”But even though disheartening at first, as Dawkins begins to back up his arguments with solid scientific reasoning, it is difficult to dispute him, and difficult not to get excited when he presents his theory with mathematical precision.Aggression and StabilityOne of the most common arguments put forward against evolution is that an uncontrolled state of aggression will lead to a free-for-all and the “stable” environment we see cannot exist. Dawkins explains this with the concept of an ESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy), which leads to a dynamic equilibrium or homeostasis: he posits a theoretical society populated by pure aggressors (“hawks”) and pure pacifists (“doves”), and proves logically that over a period of time, the number of hawks and doves will stabilise in roughly equal proportion. This is because it is not the survival machines which are having the final say on who will win: it is the genes. This concept is further expanded with fine variations on the behavior – ultimately, every time, a dynamically stable configuration results.In Chapter 12, ‘Nice Guys Finish First’ (added as part of the second edition), Dawkins takes this theory further and presents a varying set of evolutionary strategies, modelled on Game Theory. It describes in detail various evolutionary stratagems he tried out on his computer (with contributions from a lot of scientists) and the outcomes. This is a fascinating analysis and in my opinion, the most interesting part of the book – but that may just be the engineer in me, who loves anything mathematical!AltruismOh yes. The old stumbling block. The favourite saw of the creationists. If we are all selfish, how does altruism come into the picture? Why do parents sacrifice themselves for their children, why do siblings do the same for each other, why do we co-operate at all? Should we not be at each other’s throats, all the time?No, according to Dawkins. If we look at it from the gene’s point of view, it all makes perfect sense.When we are talking of genes, we are talking of gene pools here: a group of genes working together so that the survival of each is maximised. Dawkins makes a brilliant analogy to a rowing team. If a coach is choosing a team, he would over a period end up with a group who can pull in such a way that the winning chance is maximised – an individual rower, however brilliant he is, would find no place in the team if he did not contribute to the group effort. In the case of genes, natural selection plays the role of the coach. Those genes which could not co-operate simply get discarded in the evolutionary race over a period of time.Also, one should bear in mind that a gene is not a single physical bit of DNA; it is all replicas of a particular bit of DNA, distributed throughout the world. A gene might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies. If so, this could be the origin of altruism. Dawkins calls it ‘genesmanship’. He spends four chapters explaining how it applies to siblings, offspring, lovers and apparent strangers. In the last chapter (‘The Long Reach of the Gene’), Dawkins extrapolates the above argument to how the gene in one species can extend its reach to another species, possibly to the detriment of the latter, to explain parasitism.One may take it or leave it, but the arguments are well thought-out and presented with great clarity; with cold, scientific logic. There are no opinions here. It makes fascinating reading, even though the mathematical analysis may put some off!MemesThe concept of the ‘meme’ is possibly the most revolutionary one expressed in this book. Dawkins defines a meme as a unit of cultural transmission, a basic idea which gets replicated in human brains, in the ‘primeval soup’ of human culture; which, according to him, is in the same state as the biological ‘soup’ was at the dawn of life on earth. To quote the author himself:Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.According Dawkins, all prevalent ideas (including the idea of God!) is a meme: the meme survives because it has a survival value in the meme pool. If we subscribe to this idea, the whole intellectual arena is nothing but a group of memes grappling for survival – not a very edifying thought. It seems Dawkins appreciates this, because he ends the chapter on memes with the speculation that man has the capacity for genuine, disinterested, true altruism. He says “We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”I, as a fan of the Jungian idea of the Collective Unconscious, could not help speculating on whether the meme could be embedded way down in the gene itself? Maybe the Collective Unconscious is nothing but little bits of consciousness, embedded inside the DNA, which guided the process of survival? If so, it could be case for Intelligent Design – or rather, Intelligent Evolution.This is one of those ‘pop-science’ books which are enlightening and enjoyable at the same time. A must-read.

9,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1021333-jono-davis,4,"One of the most important things I took from  The Selfish Gene is an idea that I find a bit difficult to put into words.  Richard Dawkins is really good at crafting metaphors to describe scientific principles that on their own may be not be so interesting, or may be stubbornly inaccessible. While his rhetoric may make concepts more accessible and convenient to discuss, he openly warns that no metaphor is completely accurate. Understanding that the metaphors must be viewed skeptically, he offers this,""If we allow ourselves the license of talking about genes as if they had conscious aims, always reassuring ourselves that we could translate our sloppy language back into repectable terms if we wanted to, we can ask the question, what is a single selfish gene trying to do?""All things being even, genes that are long-lasting or that replicate quickly, and genes that can replicate with high fidelity are going to outnumber those that are slow or erroneous in replication. Dawkins calls this the “selfish” nature of genetic replication. He chooses his words carefully though, and applies metaphors of self-interest only to genes that are, or are not, selected for by indifferent and unthinking mechanisms.Where this metaphor breaks down, as Dawkins admits, is when the idea of “selfishness” is brought up from genetics to the level of individuals within a group, or groups within a species. He criticizes such concepts in sociobiology, where claims are made that an individual’s actions are inherently selfish in order to serve their genes in themselves, or in other related individuals.While genes may be “selfish” in order to be selected, this doesn’t necessitate that individuals (“survival machines” as he so affectionately calls us) must as well act only in self-interest. In this video introduction to the book, Dawkins suggests that,""…if you have “selfish” genes, which only means that natural selection works at the level of the gene, if you have “selfish” genes, then, you may have altruistic individuals."""
10,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975021-ali,4,"Finally, and after an excessive period of time, the main cause of which was college overwhelming demands, I managed to read and finish, from cover to cover, the book that launched the fame of the most distinguished evolutionary biologist in the world (Richard Dawkins): The Selfish Gene.Dawkins is often characterized as the World's Most Outspoken Atheist. This may be true, but it's concerned with a relatively recent development in his character. I think such reduction is misleading and unfair, quite frankly. Dawkins is an intelligent evolutionary biologist and he has contributed a lot to the field over the past three or four decades. He is very passionate about Darwinian Evolution that I'm surprised that he's not been referred to as ""Darwin's pitbull"" as much as Sir Huxley was known as ""Darwin's Bulldog""!The book is an attempt by Dawkins to offer a meticulous explanation of organisms' behavior, especially animals. Animal behavior is such an intriguing subject, indeed!. Dawkins tries to explore this phenomenal world through the lens of what he calls, ""The Selfish Gene Theory"".The Selfish Gene Theory establishes that organisms evolve by Natural Selection, but the unit of selection is, surprisingly and against all common knowledge and conventions, the gene. It's not the species, as I used to firmly hold, not even the individual, but the gene, the selfish gene. Genes were here first long before us the multi-cellular organisms. In addition, they are ""the replicators"" who will live on, unlike us the mortals. They are the immortal units of selection, and we merely are ""survival machines"" as Dawkins affirms throughout the whole book. This, to me, has a very profound implication. It seems to me to negate the ""hypothesis"" of morality being also a product of our evolution because if the Selfish Gene Theory is true, then I don't see how the ""survival of the species"" would have mattered from the first place. However, Dawkins makes the case that selfish genes might ""program"" survival machines to adopt some forms of ""altruistic"" behaviors to meet their ""selfish"" ends.Dawkins' language is that of a ""reductionist"" which doesn't surprise me as a student of biology familiar with the scientific doctrine of ""Occam's Razor"". However, I understand how his language might disturb some readers. Dawkins reduces all forms of relationships and attributes them to ""genetic"" factors including those among family members. Altruistic behavior vs. selfish behavior can all be calculated mathematically. Your mother cares about you because you contain half of her genes! Forget love, affection, and all of that emotional talk. We're merely survival machines designed by our selfish genes to propagate them. Pretty disturbing, huh?Yet, this also has a crucial implication. Dawkins affirms in the beginning of the book that it's one of ""biology"", not ""ethics"". He states that we are ""selfish by nature"", but we can teach our children to be altruistic. To me, this raises a very important question: doesn't that assert that we, indeed, possess free will? This is a profound implication that I believe Dawkins was not aware of when first writing this book. He attempts to briefly discuss this matter in the endnotes by rejecting it, but I think he didn't succeed.There's some form of dualism that the theory suggests in our case: the conscious Homo sapiens.It's very evident and prevalent.One chapter of the book is devoted to what Dawkins call, ""memes"". It's such a great idea and it shows Dawkins' skill as a ""philosopher"". Simply, a meme is a ""replicating idea"" as Daniel Dennett defines it. It makes so much sense to me that memes are replicators just like genes floating from one mind to another and manipulating subjects to insure their survival. It seems to me that religion is an example of a meme that replicates itself (from followers to followers) and struggle for survival through consistent ""adaptation"" (modification)! Dawkins' animosity towards religion is probably as old as this book is, but he offers a very mild criticism of it which makes sense given that it's not really the center focus of this book.The Selfish Gene Theory is a revolutionary idea. However, even more revolutionary is the concept of ""The Extended Phenotype"" which illustrates the ""long reach of the gene"". Dawkins dedicates a whole book to this idea, and devotes the last chapter to it. The notion simply suggests that selfish genes influence very ""indirect"" behaviors such as, building nests in birds. I must read his book ""The Extended Phenotype"" since Dawkins explores the idea much more deeply and thoroughly.To conclude, the Selfish Gene Theory (or should I say hypothesis?) is indeed a profound seductive idea as an explanation of organisms' innate behavior. I don't know, though, how much of it is predicated upon scientific evidence and how much is mere speculation, but I do know that the book is a must-read for anyone interested in animal behavior. The book brilliantly offers answers to puzzling phenomenons, but it also raises a lot of profound questions.""The only kind of entity that has to exists in order for life to arise, anywhere in the universe, is the immortal replicator."" - R. Dawkins"
11,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82566-rachelm,5,"Writing lucidly about science for a lay audience while remaining scientifically rigorous is not easy, and Dawkins does a tremendous job as he examines evolution from the point of view of the gene rather than the organism. I found this book to contain a number of ""aha"" moments -- for example, that rather than pose the question ""Why is DNA an efficient mechanism for an individual organism to reproduce itself?"", we should ask instead ""How did a giant, complicated lumbering robot such as myself become a good mechanism for the reproduction of the self-replicating entities I call my genes? Why did biological matter floating around in the primordial stew originally clump together into larger organisms?"" Dawkins answers these questions and more in an engaging fashion, applying the theory of the selfish gene to aggression, altruism, sexual and familial relationships, and to the transmission of ideas in human societies. And he makes a point of leaving us with the optimistic thought that we as humans should be informed by our biological history, but need not be bound by it."

Okay!One of stupidest criticism here on Goodreads of Adam Smith’s Theory of Wealth of Nations’ was that he made the human selfishness as basis of his theory. It was stupid as Smith didn’t invented that ‘selfishness’ he merely showed us how our economy was already based on selfishness of individuals.It is same here. In fact, in this case ‘selfishness’ is apparent selfish behaviour of genes (‘apparent’ because genes do not make conscious choices, selfless-by-default ones just won’t survive) and any effects on the individuals are unconscious. Dawkins shows how selfishness of genes can actually bring out what, at first, may look like altruistic behaviour among animals. Also, we need not be slave to our genes. In fact, we do resist behaviour imposed on us by genes. The best examples are people who remain without children all their life, contraceptives, welfare state etc.

“Contraception is sometimes attacked as 'unnatural'. So it is, very unnatural. The trouble is, so is the welfare state. I think that most of us believe the welfare state is highly desirable. But you cannot have an unnatural welfare state, unless you also have unnatural birth- control, otherwise the end result will be misery even greater than that which obtains in nature.”

There are theories in here describing how first life must have started on planet. There is also a theory (theory, not law) that tries to explain why should people die of old age. Any explanations are better than 'God did it'. One of my favorite parts were those discussing Game theory involved in biology. Above all, there are all those fascinating aspects how some animals behave. There are some insects who can be like Chinese-boxes:

 Female greenflies can bear live, fatherless, female offspring, each one containing all the genes of its mother. (Incidentally, an embryo in her mother's 'womb' may have an even smaller embryo inside her own womb. So a greenfly female may give birth to a daughter and a grand- daughter simultaneously, both of them being equivalent to her own identical twins.)

And...do you remember that romantic dialogue, 'I'll die for you'? Ladies among matinses take it too literally:

“Mantises … When they mate, the male cautiously creeps up on the female, mounts her, and copulates. If the female gets th e chance, she will eat him, beginning by biting his head off, either as the male is approaching, or immediately after he mounts, or after they separate.” 

Isn’t that lovely? Than there are the friendly fights (mostly to get girls):

 ""the notable thing about animal fights is that they are formal tournaments, played according to rules like those of boxing or fencing. Animals fight with gloved fists and blunted foils. Threat and bluff take the place of deadly earnest. Gestures of surrender are recognized by victors, who then refrain from dealing the killing blow or bite that our naive theory might predict.”

Dawkins also points out how most of Darwin’s oringal theory was wrong. Yet, you won’t find any Darwin-fundamentalists fighting against evolutionists. Several of Dawkins' own postulates must have been already proved wrong - it was written 40 years ago, that is like stone age to scientists. I don't think he would mind either.Creationists, well, they are a different breed. I guess given the condition the world is in, with all those stupid wars and ozone holes; any ideas of intelligent design can be easily trashed. And have you ever heard of that *stops to search for a word*thing called 'Donald Trump' - what is so intelligent about his existence? If I had my way, I would also have humanity consider whether we aren’t too liberal with the word when we call ourselves an 'intelligent' race. And even assuming there was a creator -than what about his/her aesthetic sense? Why should he give us bad body order? What is so intelligent about that?Coming back to creationists, well, I think Christian church was a little stupid (no offence) when it picked a head-on fight against evolutionists. All they needed to do was to manipulate the meaning of phrases in Bible and tell the world that evolution was embodied in Bible, it was just that they weren't interpreting it right. Hinduism and Islam are far cleverer in this regard. For example, as India’s respected prime minister will tell you Hindu gods had already invented plastic surgeries long before lesser mortals discovered Iron. Atom bombs, flying vehicles etc – you name it, we already had them ages ago. Read this review for more details. Whatever you may do, we did it in ancient times and were clever enough to forget about it.Also, one of most popular (pseudo) scholars on religion, Dr. Zakir Naik, tells us that truths like Big bang, evolution, Copernican solar system, existence of plasma state of matter, the growth of embryo etc. were all already explained by none other than God himself in Quran. There are many other scientific truths to be found in Quran that he has found using his far-fetched sophisticated reasoning, you can listen to him here"
13,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2181940-priscila-jord-o,3,"Although a lot has changed in social biology and ethology since this book was originally published in 1976, “The Selfish Gene” brought me numerous insights which made my respect for Dawkins grow immensely. I’ll explain why.The book can be considered today almost out of date, I think, and there’s much in it to be criticized. Dawkins language is particularly reductionist as he explains various types of animal behaviors mathematically while attributing them solely to genetic factors. He says, for instance, that an animal has 1/8 of chance of saving one of his cousins from drowning because there is a chance of 1 in 8 that he and his cousin have genes in common. Or that a mother cares about her babies just because their body is transporting half of her genes. I’m not questioning it because I found the theory insensitive or cruel (especially when it comes to human beings). We all know very well how important are genes determining behavior. But today we also know how deeply are another factors involved in this process. They are certainly relevant in different measures between animals and humans, but I’m inclined to believe that even in animals they do not exert this kind of dictatorship. And even if they did, it would be almost impossible to use mathematics to calculate things like the probability of an animal saving his cousin's life.In chapter 11 Dawkins introduces the notion of “memes” and makes an exception to the sovereignty of genes: he mentions briefly that culture may change what was genetically “predetermined” to happen and, surprisingly, that it can be considered another type of evolution. However, most of the book doesn’t take this possibility into account, which is one of the reasons why I find it out of date.Conversely, Dawkins brings up some really interesting ideas that had never come to my mind in other ways. One of them is mentioned in the second chapter, in which he explains the origins of replicant molecules (DNAs) and is confronted with the inevitable and very contemporary question: when does life begins? He solves the problem masterfully in my opinion: “Should we then call the original replicators ‘living’? Who cares? (…) Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use. The mere presence in the dictionary of a word like ‘living’ does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world”.Another of my favorite parts is the one where the talks about the evolution of the capability of simulation in animals. His theory is that conscience emerged because the simulation that brains do to calculate probabilities and risks associated to everyday tasks became so complex at one point of the evolution that it was inevitable to start including the “self” in it. I was also positively impressed by how Dawkins describes adaptation as the predominance of evolutionary stable strategies in opposition to unstable ones. It is an interesting approach to Darwin’s theory that he would probably have agreed with. The descriptions of various behaviors to exemplify his theory are also very engaging.Finally, the already mentioned chapter about memes is a good surprise at the end of the book, and reveals some of Dawkins’ skills as philosopher (as someone mentioned in a review below).For all these reasons, and although I was bored at many moments because of its reductionism, I found “The Selfish Gene” worth of reading. It certainly deserves its fame as a classic."
14,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This is the thirty year anniversary edition of the book (2006 rather than 1976) so it contains a lot of clarifications where he found there were misunderstandings. It also contains some corrections where he decided that he was either wrong or off target. He also mentions areas where other discoveries & papers took his work even further. I think I found these the most enjoyable. It's great to see science in progress. He also added a few extra chapters that were fantastic.Of course, the main reason to read this book is to read the origin of the word ""Meme"" which Dawkins created & loosed on the world in this book. I love origin stories.This is the third book that I've read written & narrated by Dawkins. I liked it better than his autobiography, but not quite as much as The God Delusion. I'm not an evolutionary biologist, so some of it went into more depth than I appreciated. It was always interesting & easy to understand, though. That he could make such complex topics so easily digested by a layman says a lot about both his ability as a writer & his knowledge of the subject.His primary point is that evolution is about gene survival. We & other living beings are just the vehicles that the genes build to perpetuate themselves. He makes it very clear throughout the book that when he ascribes words such as 'selfish' to behavior that he is putting the behavior in human terms for ease of communication. When he didn't, he used math to show his point, but he didn't do a lot of that & it was always easy to follow even when the points were counter-intuitive. There were a fair few of those.One example is the Prisoner's Dilemma problem & how it relates to selfishness. He spent quite a bit of time on this & even provided the results of several computer simulations done later by colleagues that prove out & explain the differences in iterated games versus single games. Wow. It really explains a lot about symbiosis, herd/group, & even cuckoos' behavior.I'm just plain impressed by this man & his thought processes, but I'm not sure if I'll read any more of his books. He mentions where he goes into more detail in other books & papers throughout this edition of this book, but he covers enough of The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene for me here, I think. Maybe not. It's an intriguing subject. Perhaps if I come across the audio version I'll succumb to temptation. He & Lalla Ward do a great job of narrating & the ideas are fascinating. It's amazing just how complex processes can arise out of such simple objects working in groups. Of course, there's been a LOT of time & trial & error. Statistically it makes sense. Dawkins has seen to that. Using his thoughts as a baseline for alien life is even more fascinating. I hope I live to see if his theories are born out.Of course, I recommend this highly. Definitely get this edition, if you can. If you've only read the first edition, get & read this one. It's worth it."

It's so outside my comfort zone (a book about genetics? Are you MAD?), I just went for it. And I am very glad I did.That's the great thing about Kindles. You can do mad stuff in seconds flat.Skip the forewords and introductions, they're sententious verbiage. Just start reading the book - by the time you've done, you'll actually WANT to go back to the forewords and revision notes. Because this book is seriously fun.Honestly. It's highly readable, thought-provoking and never less than entertaining. Imagine reading a TV series like Coast or a Robert Winston documentary - the mixture of powerful images, connections to the everyday and down to earth presentation actually make the subject matter of the book relevant, alive and, well, splendid.Richipoos takes the odd diversion to indulge in some academic spattery, (one reason, perhaps, this was dubbed a 'young book' - it was written 30 and more years ago) but generally is on the side of the reader, which is why his ideas come across so clearly. The book explores the role of the 'eternal gene', the miraculous and self-replicating bunch of amino-acids that is US and how we are effectively a co-operative of chemical conveniences. Starting with the primeval soup and ending with why mums and dads do what they do, it's a roller-coaster ride. I'm serious - like I said, this would normally tick all my ohnoimnotreadingthatshit buttons. I was grinning through most of it and rare was the day when I didn't share a thought or insight the book had triggered or opened up with my long-suffering wife Sarah.I had the time of my life reading this. I wish I could say the same about my my current struggle with Umberto Eco's somewhat turgid latest, but that - as they say - is another story..."
16,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/388643-m-d,3,"I read this book when I was a student and studying genetics at the time. This helped a lot, it made an awful lot more sense than what I was learning and I have Professor Dawkins to thank for making me look like a genius in a lecture and completely getting my head round an essay.I am a big fan of Richard Dawkins, and this is his genius. I admire his ability to argue something so comprehensively and convincingly. I first discovered him in a book of essays where he wrote a letter to his daughter Juliet (who was ten at the time) explaining how you must always look for evidence. That, I believe, is one of the most important things to learn in life and the way he presents it to a child is impressive.(The book, incidentally, is called How Things Work. I must see if I can add it)However, despite being in awe of Professor Dawkins, I find him a little cruel in the way he removes the potential for all the nice things in life. If he is correct, we may as well all be selfish and thoughtless at all times because to do otherwise is simply irrational. I like to retain a little naivete in my convictions, it makes life more palatable.Apparently ""The Blind Watchmaker"" is his best book, but I have completely read very few of his books and prefer to listen to him talk."
17,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Any reader of fiction understands the importance of narrative point of view. Influential evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins adopts that idea here. The point of view is that of the gene. His “selfish gene” is a metaphor, an anthropomorphic representation of a replicating sequence of genetic code.He clarifies this idea with an astonishing admission:  “There is no universally agreed definition of a gene.”(p.36) Starting with this blank slate frees him to create parameters that suit his own purposes:  “A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection....[A] gene is a replicator with high copying fidelity.” (p. 35) In one analogy he compares a gene to a cooperative team of rowers. The individual is merely a vehicle for the focused efforts of this team. Instead of quibbling about the physical entity of the gene, Dawkins focuses his attention on salient properties: copying errors, fecundity (the rate of replication), chromosomal rearrangement, and chemical “rivalry.” These in turn govern observable properties of the organism: viscosity ( “...any tendency for individuals to continue living to the place where they were born.”) and memory (p.282)His arena is a multi-generational dynamic of ephemeral winners and losers, quantitative dominance in the gene pool. He proposes various strategies for achieving that dominance, and asserts that the results are mathematically predictable through game theory. A step-wise picture of evolution emerges:  “Progressive evolution may be not so much a steady upward climb as a series of discrete steps from stable plateau to stable plateau.” (p.113) Each plateau signals the achievement of an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS).This revolutionary book was published in 1976. Dawkins cites two important influences. William Donald Hamilton (1936-2000) developed the idea of “kin selection” – the basis for the principle that  “...a gene might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies....” (p.114) In a chapter titled “Genesmanship"", Dawkins provides a simplified version of a formula for calculating the odds that two individuals share a particular gene.George C. Williams (1926-2010) contributed the idea of pleioptropy – multiple effects of a single gene. An example is the activation of a gene when the chemical properties of aging accumulate. I mention these antecedents because I often felt I had fallen into a time warp. Dawkins' ideas are a far cry from the Mendelian genetics I learned in school. Readers familiar with these earlier evolutionary pioneers will have a much easier time navigating this book than I had. I read the 40th anniversary edition, published in 2016. Extensive explanatory footnotes, often running on for pages, have been added and need to be read in conjunction with the text. This is expedited by the formatting of the Kindle edition. Fortunately, this book is leavened with surprising behavioral examples. We learn that a whale song can continue for eight minutes without repetition. (p.68) We learn that a strain of worker bee has the “hygenic” behavior of detecting and culling grubs infected by a particular disease. The culling requires two steps: uncapping the wax cell of the larva and evicting the larva from the hive. (p.78) A strain of mice exhibit the “Bruce effect.” The male mouse exudes a chemical that causes a female impregnated by a different male to abort. (p.191) Vampire bats will regurgitate and share excess blood harvested during the night with unsuccessful bats. (p.298) Dawkins examines and explains these behaviors through the lens of his “selfish gene.”"

This book is an excellent work on Evolutionary biology, Genes, Behavioral biology and Natural selection, among many other fascinating topics. Dawkins is succinct, eloquent and a very intelligent tutor. He uses examples and metaphors to illustrate his point and to coalesce them all to form one unifying picture, of a universe, not in perfect harmony, but in tumult and constant change. The chapter on “Memes” blew me off absolutely; I would want my friends to read just that chapter even if they don’t read the whole book. His ideas are fascinating and logical, but his way of expressing and putting them in words is even better. What a shame that he got into the new atheist movement and all the bad publicity that came with it. As a scientist, I found him at the top of his game.This is a very readable, entertaining and beautifully written book that I would recommend to any one who, like me, bunked their biology lectures back in school. There is a lot to learn from this book. The 30th anniversary edition is annotated and made up to date with additional chapters, so the older edition should be avoided. Read it, let is rinse your brain, and repeat."

20,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,5,"Reading this book was like meeting with a person about whom you have heard a lot, who has some kind of legendary status, and overall so well-acclaimed that you cannot resist the temptation to meet the person. Another thing you have heard is that the person is so simple, down to earth that he would take the trouble to talk to any layman, to make these biological terms much easier, more comprehensible and comfortable for him. And you think talking to you won't cause him much trouble because you are well aware of some technical biological jargons. So, when Mr. Dawkins finally meets you through his legendary The Selfish Gene, you wait eagerly to hear out some more intricate complex terms as the stature of the book and the writer. The chapters in the beginning (2 & 3) bore a bit with their roundabout words. But if you can keep a little bit patience up to Chapter 5, then as the chapters go on you begin to realize why this book is a Classic after all! I must agree that it's one of the finest books I have read. Chapter 1 is adorable with its nice philosophical leaps. The best chapters are Battle of the Generations and Battle of the Sexes. The chapter on memes sounds like the movie Inception. Overall the book is the best reward for its readers."

22,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11000479-leajk,5,"When I read this a couple of years ago, I loved it. I've also been at a loss to see why people had troubles liking Richard Dawkins, sure he was harsh sometimes in debates, but mostly I found him intellectually honest.It's higly ironic that not even a week after I was defending my idol Dawkins against accusations of his research being biased, I find myself in some serious doubts regarding my previous respect for him.  This is to the best of my memory what happened last week: My fellow beer drinker: You can't take any book written by Dawkins seriously since he's an agressive ranting atheist. Me: Wrong. You should never confuse the personal opinion a person holds with their science. If their evidence holds up it shouldn't matter. I wouldn't care if he was [searching my mind for one of the most offensive thing a person could be to me] a SEXIST, that wouldn't change my view of his research. They are two seperate things. Fellow (male) beer drinker nods and looks slightly perplexed that I, a raging feminist, would defend anyone who was a sexist. Me vs. MFBD: 1-0And then I read this today:  Scientific American and this: Blag hag If you don't feel you have the time to read the articles this is a short summary of what happened:(view spoiler)[The whole elevator thing is quite simple, a man hit on a woman at a atheist conference in a situation that she felt was less than comfortable (in an elevator in the middle of the night), she said no and they both moved on. She then mentioned the situation (with no names) in a vlog post. In her video she was not attacking the guy just saying that for future reference she did not enjoy being suggested in an elevator after a long day of talking about sexism, she just advised people that she would not be favourable for any such propositions. And then suddenly all these men got very angry and said she was a feminazi and that someone should actually rape her at the next conference. That's where the actual sexism enters in my opinion. The guy in the elevator was just clumsy and perhaps a bit creepy, and that is in my mind all she said. She wasn't saying anything in the video about him being a patriarchial opressor, just that maybe he should reconsider his game strategy. And for this she gets the response that she's should be punished and raped! That is most certainly sexism.Into this debate enters Richard Dawkins, the guru of the sceptics movement, and chastises the woman in question for mentioning silly stuff such as choosing to reject offers in late night elevators, when there are other women being actually raped all around the world. Logic? Who needs it! (hide spoiler)]So apparently I was closer to the truth then I would've guessed. It doesn't change my views on Dawkins's general theories about genes as such, overall they appear sound and generally supported. However I can't help the nagging thoughts in the back of my head, that maybe some of the parts on sex and gender in the book might have been tainted by his private views on women (i.e. that women shouldn't really care about gender roles unless she's being physically assulted. I mean who cares about sexism if you're not being mutulated? Or a higher pay for that matter?). So, me vs. MFBD: 0-1?"
23,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,4,"I bought this book because I'm fascinated by the idea of evolution - I mean, at first glance it appears utterly preposterous, right? So I wanted to take a closer look. I started by reading The Origin of Species (Darwin, of course). That was well worth-while but clearly his theory was wrong, for many reasons, most of which are given in the book, by Darwin himself. The key problem for Darwin was that whilst he knew there had to be some kind of inheritance of characteristics, he had no idea what the mechanism was. Genetics came to the rescue of evolutionary theories by providing such a mechanism. OK - so now I had to find out what a modern theory of evolution looked like. I read Niles Eldredge's Re-inventing Darwin, which turned out to be a book making a counter-case to ideas proposed by Dawkins. I found it pretty convincing, but then I hadn't read any Dawkins. It didn't really provide what I was looking for, anyway; the book doesn't set out a complete theory of evolution, instead it takes an academic debate into the popular science arena. Much time goes by and I end up with Gould's last collection of essays. It turns out that he was strongly opposed to many of Dawkins' ideas, too - but that book only gave a sketch of a theory, in two essays. Time to actually read some Dawkins, then and give the guy a fair hearing. I picked up his most famous book and found that I'd made another blunder; The Selfish Gene is about the evolution of altruism! Basically it's about animal behaviour. Fer goodness' sake; I might have to start reading the blurb before I buy books on evolution!

28,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"The Selfish Gene is still widely read 40 years after publication, remarkable for a science book, and it continues to cause controversy. In straightforward language Dawkins offers theories for the beginning of life, evolution, sexual differentiation and altruism in human behavior. He takes literary license and uses anthropomorphic language to describe genetic attributes best described by mathematics. This technique makes the book accessible to the lay reader but also makes it read like our genes are consciously plotting their destiny. Dawkins inserts many disclaimers that this is not his intent. Detractors also assert that he is reducing human behavior and morals to nothing more than chemistry thus denying fundamental human value. Dawkins also goes to great length to deny this interpretation. I believe Dawkins succeeds. While very readable, Dawkins challenges our minds, requiring deep thought to reap equally deep rewards. My notes follow.How did life start? Dawkins proposes replicators. Think of chains of amino acids, abundant on the early earth, forming protein like molecules that can change the structure of other amino acid chains to look just like them. Dawkins doesn’t mention prions, but replicators sound very similar to me and today we find prions in ever more places and responsible for a host of diseases from mad cow to Alzheimer’s. Eventually the replicators run out of raw material and start consuming each other. Mutations occur: some develop defenses such as prototypical cell walls, then others develop ways to penetrate the walls and evolution is underway at some point crossing the threshold into what we would call living. The replicators themselves become genes, the dictators of the individual organism’s attributes and behaviors. The organism is the survival machine the genes have constructed and with over 3.5 billion years to work in, these machines can become very complicated, even human. How did this evolution take place? Natural selection operates at the level of the gene. Individual organisms are the vehicles for the gene. The gene operates its vehicle through phenotypic effects. If that effect promotes individual survival and reproduction the gene spreads. Eventually all the genes in a population plateau at an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS). Mutant genes will come and go but the rare positive one will disrupt the status quo until a new ESS is achieved. Dawkins key point is that natural selection operates not on what is best for the species or individual but what is best for the gene. This may seem like a truism, but this is where notes fall short. You have to read the book. How did individual organisms become male and female? First were the isogametes which are produced by meiosis just like sperms and eggs. But unlike sperms and eggs isogametes are indistinguishable from each other. Thus any individual can mate with any other. Eventually sperms and eggs evolved as some gametes found it advantageous to be prolific and mobile (sperms) while others benefited by providing large and nutrient rich targets (eggs). The owners of the large and nutrient rich gametes invested more resources in their production. In animal evolution this led to females nurturing and caring for their offspring. Females adopted strategies to get help in the task including strategies to determine male faithfulness. Thus courtship is widely practiced among many species. If all males were faithful courtship would not be necessary. A readily compliant female would immediately attract a faithful companion and her genes would prosper. But too many easy females lead to philandering males who gain advantage for their genes propagating them widely. But a preponderance of philandering males in turn results in more females demanding evidence of commitment provided by courtship. Eventually the proportion of coy to easy female behavior and faithful to philandering male behavior balances out to an Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Keep in mind Dawkins presents this from the gene’s point of view. The genes are working to maximize their own numbers not the individual organism’s although that too may result.Similar to the idea of an ESS that balances animal courtship behavior is the ESS of aggressive behavior. In general aggressive behaviors will occupy a proportion of individual behaviors that equalize overall payback. If all members were aggressive, too many would get hurt. If none were, one aberrant aggressor would run amok spreading genes until too many aggressors reduced the payback below that of the non-aggressors. Eventually the proportion of aggressors and/or the range of aggressive behaviors of individuals will come to a balance, an ESS. What is good for the genes as expressed through the individual not the species dictates behavior. Lions don’t try to eat other lions to preserve the species but because it is far safer for the individual lion to attack an antelope for a meal than another lion. Dawkins elaborates on the Prisoner’s Dilemma game showing it to be similar to the way ESS’s develop when the game is played continuously for an unknown indeterminate length of time. This version is called Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. It’s too complex to explain here, but nice guys don’t finish last in this explanation of how reciprocal altruism develops in animal and plant societies. He fascinatingly uses his examples to explain the “live and let live policy” between the German soldiers and the British soldiers facing each other in the trenches of WWI in the first two years of the war. This was of course not a great strategy for the generals who had to win the war but it worked quite well for the soldiers. For those interested in game theory and evolution this chapter is a must read.The genes that affect the individual’s fate are not only its own. Gene’s operate inside and outside the body of an organism. Dawkins gives the example of the snail and the parasitic fluke that preys on it. The fluke’s genes change the thickness of the snail’s shell which may not help the snail. Dawkins doesn’t mention the microbiome which has drawn so much attention lately. We now realize that most genes in and on the human body are not human but belong to the countless bacteria and microorganisms that populate our guts, mouths, skin, etc. The huge impact these foreign genes have on human wellbeing and behavior is just beginning to be understood. In a presentation that otherwise seems to marginalize individual value in favor of the genes, Dawkins does acknowledge the power of human consciousness and culture to override genetic imperatives. Dawkins is famous for introducing the term meme in the The Selfish Gene. Derived from a Greek root to rhyme with the word gene, Dawkins christened meme the unit of transmission for the evolution of culture. It is the element of knowledge handed down generation to generation, be it language, song, fashion or ideas. The meme uses the human brain as its vehicle to propagate itself as it is transferred from person to person. Dawkins points to the concept of God as a particularly successful meme of great longevity and ubiquity and one that evolves just as genes do. Even if you are uncomfortable with Dawkins thinking or his presentation style and even if some of the material is a bit dated, there is just way too much food for thought here to ignore. My notes are just a small taste of what this book provides. Five stars all the way. If you haven’t read it, please treat yourself. I hope it leaves your mind racing just as it did mine."
29,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"This is the crown jewel of Dawkin's popular works. It is a masterpiece of choice illustration, finely honed definitions and pedantically nuanced distinctions, all framed by his engaging, pacey style. It has justly made him an iconic populariser. It is his best referenced and most tightly reasoned book. He starts with characteristic confidence: Darwinian evolution is as established as the earth's solar orbit. Blind prejudice or intellectual deficiency alone could misinterpret the data. The debate about his ingenious central thesis, the validity of a gene-focussed and gene-preserving explanation of altruism and other counter-intuitive behaviours, continues 31 years on. Strange then that as an exponent of hard-nosed empiricism, that his second chapter should take flight into the hyperspace of imaginative speculation. From p.12-14 see the brave professor leaping confidently into the realm of pre-biotic evolution. A world of hydrogen and methane, lashed with lightning, in which pre-biotic substrates accumulate to such excess they form a scum on the primordial soup. Serious doubts about the duration and degree of an intensely reducing atmosphere are voiced by geologists, but this is no deterrent to our bold champion. Watch the analytical chemists sucking their teeth and wincing as the author leaps further into the abyss, the bungee cord of tedious documentation and observation already looking dangerously frayed. Where are the pyrimidine nucleosides? (quite impossible to synthesize). What of the instability of cytosine? How can phosphate be preserved without precipitation? What on earth will enable bases, sugars (requiring quite different synthetic conditions) and phosphate to meet, and then miraculously and without enzymes to fuse correctly as even the most primitive proto DNA/RNA. The gaping abyss of data appears unending, yet Poppins-like, our professor seems to assure us, if we wish for it hard enough, however impossible - anything can happen. The difficulties have but just begun, what of chirality, what of the propensity of polymers to hydrolyse, how to survive intense ozone-less UV radiation? But lo! (p. 15) Our seer perceives a miracle - a virgin birth! * No, more amazing still, a virgin Replicator, unbegotten yet always begetting! Intrinsically unstable enough to have been formed initially, but stable enough to fill the whole earth with copies. Despite a studied vagueness here he suggests a primitive form of DNA (now his latest vogue is AATE). In p 18. our mysterious replicator wonderfully accumulates longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity. By p.19, wonder of wonders, it has metamorphosed into a `simple' cell, with protein synthetic machinery, chiral purity, an intact membrane barrier, metabolic, transport, repair functions and most marvellous of all the ability to reproduce the whole. By p.20 the miracle transformation of `goo' to you is complete. Here is narrative that makes the wildest encounters of the Enterprise or Galactica look as mundane as Coronation Street by comparison. Here is drawn out, revivified spontaneous generation similar to the kind Pasteur definitively crushed in 1862, 3 years after the Origin was published. The imaginary link in chapter 2 is indispensable to the chain of Dawkin's whole thesis. But this is not science - it's wishful supposition. Here is a religious materialism that avoids the data, rather than re-examine its assumptions, however increasingly ridiculous they appear. *(Footnote to p.16. Dawkins' over forced distinction between two Hebrew terms is artificial, as 10 min reference to a concordance might have warned him. It suggests over-reliance on doubting colleagues, dubiously disguised as theologians. See the Hebrew of Joel 1.8.) "
30,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"I'm a fan of Dawkins' work both in biology and skepticism, so take my praise and criticism with that calibrating qualification. I've read, I think, five of his books. I did not like this one quite as much as The Ancestor's Tale. While I agreed with the premise and theory proposed, sometimes his style of writing got in the way. Normally, I like analogies and metaphors to help explain complex ideas, but in this case I think he went too far in that direction, at least in the first half of the book. Although he was careful to use quote marks when attributing 'feelings' to genes such as 'wanting' or 'trying' to do this or that, I still felt that it muddled the message. I think he could have found a better stylistic method to get his points across. I also felt he could have done a better job of explaining how genes, proteins and enzymes create different cell types. His description was a bit vague for my layman's ears, and other authors have done better.Although he appears to want to totally rule out the possibility of group selection, I think there is still room for that possibility in some circumstances, particularly in small, cohesive groups, bands or tribes of humans; i.e., hunter-gatherers. He suggests that free-loaders, cheaters and selfish individuals would eventually invade and take over altruistic groups. I don't think this is what actually happens. I think such individuals would be banished, ostracized and thus their survival and reproductive opportunities would be limited. Such groups use taboos and tribal religions to minimize free-loading. And although I can't lay my hands on it at the moment, there was a recent research paper about group selection in microorganisms. Given that this book is more than 30 years old, it's possible that Dawkins' own views may have changed ever so slightly.It is unfair to criticize a book of this age for ideas that have subsequently proven to be false, or most likely so. For example he describes surplus (junk) DNA as “a parasite, or at best a harmless but useless passenger...”. New research is suggesting that there may be no such thing as junk DNA, and it may have purposes we have yet to fully understand. Similarly, I wonder what changes he might make to a new edition in light of the recent “Epigenetics Revolution”. One of my favorite passages of the book is when he asks “...will there be any principle that is true of all life? Obviously I do not know but, if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.” And I loved when he says that “...Darwinism is too big a theory to be confined to the narrow context of the gene.” And he shows how it applies in his new (at that time) concept of memes, that can be used to help explain the evolution of languages, religions and other facets of human culture.My criticisms should be taken in the context of 'friend' and admirer of Dawkins who wants him to keep on writing and making his ideas as clear as possible to people like me who aren't near as bright as he is. This was and still is an important, classic work."
31,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"I know that you're all swooning now and sitting in awe of how incredibly well read I am, but let's just all settle down a minute so that I can tell you what I thought of this. Because really, that's why we're here. ;)Overall, I thought that this was really interesting. I like Dawkins already after listening to The God Delusion (although I liked that one much more than this one). I think The Selfish Gene is intriguing and plausible and actually makes a lot of sense. It was really interesting to learn about the different possibilities for design and evolution, and to see the cause and effect of different variations of a gene. I liked the risk and reward concept as well... It all makes a lot of sense to think of things in this kind of philosophical way -- Everything we are and will be is a carefully honed creation of time and trial and error and cause and effect. It kinda makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Where this one fell a little flat was in the reading and the very last quarter of the book. The reading was pretty good. I'd give it a B- overall. Lalla Ward and Richard Dawkins alternate reading this one, and mostly do a good job with the tone and pacing and all that. But there are times when it was just plain distracting, too. Lalla Ward speaks very proper British, e-nun-cee-a-ting her words and speaking very crisply and clearly, almost to the detriment of what she's actually saying, when all I can focus on is her pronunciation. Even when it's not WAY strange pronunciations like ""hah-reem"" instead of ""hare-em"" for ""harem"", her pronunciation just gets in the way, and at times just sounds a little school teacherish. Richard read all his own end notes immediately after the section in which they pertained, and sometimes he sounded almost bored and sad. And other times he sounded very pompous and critical of others. At one point in an end note, he went on a little tirade about computer programmers creating computer viruses, which has nothing at all to do with the point of this book. Which brings me to the last quarter of the book, in which he goes off on a statistical and odds game ramble for AGES. Explaining different types of betting and games of chance, and possible outcomes and options depending on whether one plays this way or that way... Sort of relevant to genes, but not really new, in that he'd already illustrated the odds and possible outcomes of genes ending up one way or another, and the cooperation of genes with another to improve odds or to effect a desired outcome, etc. Kinda glazed my eyes over a bit in this section because it was just a rehash of information already provided, and in a much less relevant and interesting (to me) way. Overall, I enjoyed this one. I feel like I learned something, and that's why I read it. Could have been a bit better in the execution department, but I can't complain too much. You may resume swooning now. :D"
32,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"The Selfish Gene was an interesting, informative, and thought-provoking read. I appreciated Dawkins’s organization and the logical flow of the book. At times, my admittedly overenthusiastic highlighting led to this manner of silliness:Also, the chapter on nice guys finishing first was definitely my favorite, and it has whet my appetite for exploring the fascinating realm of game theory. Overall, Dawkins generally strikes a decent balance between intelligent, thorough scientific analysis and accessibility. This is hard to do, and he does err on the side of caution/accessibility rather more than I’d prefer. This strategy is of course good for reaching a larger reading audience, but it is also a limiting factor on amount of detail/complexity/rigor that can be presented. That is the reason I don’t generally go in for “pop science” type books, but I knew what this was before I started reading it, and thus can’t fault Dawkins for it. Indeed he himself warns the reader about this tendency in ample detail in the introductory material.Bottom line: this is the best book by Dawkins I've read so far, and I highly recommend it!"
33,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"There's a point in this book where Dawkins tells the story of how, after publishing it, he received a letter from a man who said that this work has put him in depression. I can understand why. Although I see it as a brilliant work of science, I can't help but feel a little bit scared of the truth of it. Scared not in the sense of wishing it weren't true, but scared for understanding exactly how much of a nothing there exists before and after us, and how we are only vehicles for the tiny little replicators that form us head to toe. I am in awe at the writing, and in awe of science in general, be it that it's biology, physics, mathematics, astronomy, you name it, I am convinced that it and art are the only two beautiful truths that mankind will ever know. I can't wait to read some more on the subject, deepen my knowledge of genetics and its implications, and hopefully along the way read some more of Dawkins' works because they are crafted with the eye of a highly literate man."
34,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/605975-luke-baumgarten,5,"The book, ostensibly about how evolution acts primarily at the level of genes rather than organisms, is damn cool. Also, though, tacked into the back is the coining and brief explanation of the idea of memetics, applying a genetic evolutionary model to the way ideas disperse amongst cultural groups and become entrenched in the societal fabric. It's an utterly mindblowing epistemological theory that's totally changed the way I think about ... everything really ... and it's included almost as an afterthought. Shows you something of the fecundity of Dawkins' brain before he settled into his current dotardly atheistic obsession with faith-baiting. Ah well, got a couple good books out of him anyway."

I’m sure it was very cathartic to write but to the reader it tends to come across as the academic equivalent of waggling your fingers in your ears and chanting ‘nur-nur-nee-nur-nur’."
36,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12369477-pratibha-suku,5,"Sheer Brilliance.Biology is a science which I consider keeps you in awe always and when one have someone explaining it in such a simple yet profound manner one can't help but fall in love with it, all over again and again.Like a Boss, Richard brings out the much evident yet largely ignored logic that leads to evolution over a course of time. He goes around in each life process to put froth the ""selfish"" nature of gene.  With a wonderful command on language he puts his idea, back them with suitable examples, analogies, do some maths and make you agree !!.Simple.eg-
""A gene that is ignored in this way is called recessive. The opposite of a recessive gene is a dominant gene"" ""rivals for the same slot on a chromosome, they are called alleles""

""Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.""
A must read for anyone who wants to know/understand the biology of evolution without getting troubled by the technical jargon.Thanks Ganesh for recommending. :)"

I am not in any way disputing the thesis; I find that which is stated so obvious and then he goes on and on and on theorizing it to pieces. The audiobook I read was an updated edition. It is narrated by the author and Laila Ward. Ward reads the original text of the book, and the author reads the copious notes modifying the original text. He further analyzes some points (into oblivion), disputes criticisms that have been made and makes corrections. When he disputes criticisms I was annoyed because it felt unfair that he continually got the last word. ..... I felt that he was full of himself.I am returning this book not yet having completed it. Half is enough to get the message."

I rather enjoyed endless ideas. Specially ""Meme"", which I was vaguely thinking before this book about similar idea, but it made it much much much more clear to me. I loved it and I even may spend my thesis on this idea if at all possible.I rather enjoyed the sidenotes on its 2nd edition. It was both informative and fun. I loved it and I strongly suggest it all strong minds."
39,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"I have no choice but to update my review of this, once progressive, book. This was the 30th anniversary addition. Dawkins had a real chance here to help usher the theory of evolution into the 21st century but chose not to. There is no excuse for that. He is far more harmful to the progression of science now than he was every helpful in the past. He and all the other fossils need to have their theories in the rocks where they belong. Just this week, the Royal Society *finally* met to talk about updating the modern synthesis of evolution. Progress in this area has been so very slow, it's as if the neo-Darwinists are actually neo-creationists. They sound an awful lot like the creationists they fight against. Dawkins throws a tantrum anytime epigenetics is mentioned. It's not like we should let new evidence govern our decisions or anything..... Let's just stick with one book, no matter how old or outdated it might be. No I am not talking about the bible, I am talking about the Selfish Gene and the legacy of stubbornness and bullying it continues to leave in its wake. It's time to stop anchoring ourselves to such a narrow theory of evolution, and by extension evolutionary behavior, when myriad new and *solid* evidence keeps bombarding us. It's time to allow more progressive and more knowledgeable scientists to take the reigns. Instead, Dawkins spends his time bullying them, trying to ruin their careers by discrediting them, and continually seeking fame above truth. I have read every word of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and autobiography. It seems very clear to me that Darwin would not simply dislike Dawkins, he would hold particular disdain for him. If Dawkins happened to be teaching a course Darwin was taking, Darwin would undoubtedly refuse to attend. He would protest Dawkins' outdated lectures and do everything he could to avoid such a dinosaur. He would instead sneak over to an epigenetics course, in which he was not enrolled, and take particular delight in the new ideas born out of the robust and exciting evidence that has been accumulated over the past 50 years. My original review:Dawkins is brilliant. No question. I would recommend this book, most because I think the theory is excellent and Dawkins explanation of so many things is spectacular. However, he is often far too self-congratulatory. Even worse, in the 30th anniversary edition he failed to take into account the new evidence from epigenetics (that actually does not necessarily have to destroy the selfish gene theory.) He is stuck in an outdated paradigm, which is a shame because he truly is a brilliant passionate, and insightful scientist. "
40,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"In my quest to read a bit more non-fiction, I think reading up on Dawkins is a wise choice. He claims to be aiming his books -- or at least this one -- at three audiences: the layman, the expert and the student. Well, I'm somewhere between layman and student, since I have a pretty good level of knowledge about the stuff, but I'm not formally learning it. The Selfish Gene was easy and even enjoyable to read, with things explained in as simple a way as possible, and sometimes formulated in a handful of ways or with several examples, to help expand on his point.The Selfish Gene has a lot of material in it that was already discussed in similar or identical terms in The Ancestor's Tale, but goes rather more into depth about it. The title is misleading, since Dawkins doesn't actually believe that genes are self-aware. His language isn't all that confusing, once you read past the title, though. He makes it fairly clear when his words should be taken as more metaphorical than accurate.I found his section on memes pretty interesting -- hadn't known that he'd coined the word. People misinterpret that section, too, suggesting that memes are self-aware and actually want to survive. He suggests something more along the lines of natural selection, making memes actually very similar to genes.I suppose I'd have to read around more in the field to know how much I agree with Dawkins. For someone with my level of knowledge, he gives a pretty clear and accurate argument -- but then, of course, I don't have the knowledge to dispute him."
41,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5565551-damien,4,"The Selfish Gene is certainly a fascinating book and I can understand why is it so widely regarded and discussed. I probably went into this book with slightly misjudged expectations, which is entirely my own fault, by expecting a study of the case for evolution - this I see Dawkins has more fully addressed in The Greatest Show on Earth. What we get in The Selfish Gene is a very focused discussion on why we, and indeed life in general, may act in altruistic ways. It's this single discussion that is so fully fleshed out in this book that gives birth to the theory of The Selfish Gene.Some have complained that The Selfish Gene theory de-humanises us and I can certainly see that point. In this theory, Dawkins proposes that the essential element of life - in fact the key metric for life - is the self-replicating gene. Once this is defined we then move on to the concept of replicators and vehicles. In this context humans, or any other complex life form, are not seen as the unit for propagation - instead we humans are merely vehicles for the ongoing propagation of the 'unit' of life, the gene. Based on the above context Dawkins then goes on, in considerable detail, to demonstrate that it is perfectly plausible for us as humans to act in an altruistic manner in the interest of maintaining the interest of the genes that we are mere vehicles for.The Selfish Gene is a thought provoking book that will leave you feeling a little more humble in the universe we inhabit."
42,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5813283-rohini,5,"Selfish gene is the story of evolution and animal behaviour written in an almost impeccable style by Dawkins through the language of genes. With advances in biology, we definitely need to employ this outlook towards understanding why and how does an organism evolve from a single celled free living entity to merged symbiotic establishments eventually giving rise to complex multicellular organisms. It is all the course of the 'selfish gene' trying to survive in this dynamic, highly selective world. In fact, every animal/plant behaviour can be reasoned out through their underlying genes. Dawkins' analogies are simply wonderful when he explains such a slow complex phenomenon of evolution. This book has definitely given me a different perspective in analysing and comprehending the link between species development and genes per se. A must-read for those who want to know the mystery of how and why many of us are here in this planet. All the world's a stage, And all the beings merely players- the story,however, is being directed and narrated by the Genes! "
43,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787684-cory,1,"In the indispensable words of my university genetics professor, ""buy the book, read it, burn the book and then burn down the book story where you bought it. Dawkins write absolute rubbish that he uses neither for the betterment of science or humanity, but for his own personal vendetta against creationists and the church."" Great summary of the book. "
44,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4,"It's hard to argue with Dawkins especially since he has logic on his side. Evolution is one of my favourite subjects and so it's not a surprise that I enjoyed the chapters in this book. Some may argue that we, as a species, are not selfish. They may add that we build communities and societies thanks to our altruistic nature. The truth is, as Dwakins pointed out, that even our most selfless actions have selfish motives. We cooperate and live in communities because we figured out that living together is much more beneficial than living individually. If you want to follow more arguments and hear more examples like that one then this book is for you. Although not a new work of writing, as far as I'm concerned it is a wonderful piece theoretical argumentation. "
45,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2694023-giovanni-bianco,3,"The Selfish Gene has become a classic in scientific popular literature. It is the herald of a certain popular genetic reductionism that still pervades biology.Its merit is to make a competent presentation of evolution in a genetic perspective, using numerous examples and applications of neo-Darwinian logic. Additionally, there is a good selection of ""stories and tales"" of natural life, which color and elucidate the aridity of their arguments and make the book more interesting.Nevertheless, the book is the product of a brutally reductionist conception of life - a conception of living beings as ""gene machines"". This position is protected under the argument that it is only ""describing things as they are - not as we wish they were."" But this is not the point. Except for the views of ""the evolution of species,"" Dawkins fails to really discuss alternative hypotheses to his general framework.The book strengthens a dominant view, and makes no serious discussion of the main alternatives that emerged outside the dominant discourse. Although not compromise the clarity of his explanation, this attitude impoverishes the reader's understanding (which, as he says, is just a layman), giving a mistaken notion of a definitive explanation and consensus, when in fact, this is a field full of uncertainty and debate. Lacked respect for diversity of interpretations and the spirit of scientific debate. Thus the work becomes manifest only one of the voices of the debate - the predominant voice.He denies, therefore, important evidence of directional processes that complement the statistical randomness of mutations. With this, presents the reader a model excessively simplified of the dynamics genetic of organisms - conveniently not mentioning mechanisms that can by in check various points of his own perspective. It also hides important non-genic processes that participate in the formation of organisms and act as ""shock absorbers"" or ""normalizers"" of mutations, from holistic characteristics of the formation of tissues, organs and the organism as a whole, which directly influence the probabilities of survival.We found some of the best moments of the work when Dawkins makes your writing more essayistic, with greater freedom to develop hypotheses - as, for example, in the brief passage in which he speculates on the origin of self-consciousness, the cause of which is the development of a social mapping whose sophistication requires the inclusion of a model of yourself.In the last chapter, he presents the hypothesis Meme - perhaps the main reason for the popularity of the book. It is a thought provoking and should have their share of truth. However, suffers from the same crass reductionism of the central theory. In fact, it is even worse because memes are not even measurable phenomenon, and its definition in practical terms even more difficult than the genes themselves.- - - - O Gene Egoísta tornou-se um clássico científico contemporâneo. É o arauto popular de um certo reducionismo gênico que ainda impregna a biologia. Seu principal mérito é fazer uma apresentação competente da evolução em uma perspectiva genética, utilizando-se de inúmeros exemplos e aplicações da lógica neodarwinista. A isso se soma uma boa seleção de ""histórias e causos"" da vida natural, que colorem e elucidam a aridez de seus argumentos e tornam o livro mais leve e interessante. Não obstante, o livro é produto de uma concepção brutalmente reducionista da vida -- uma concepção dos seres vivos como ""máquinas gênicas"". Essa posição intransigente se protege sob o argumento de que está apenas ""descrevendo as coisas como elas são -- e não como nós gostaríamos que elas fossem"". Mas não é este o ponto. Exceto no caso das visões de ""evolução da espécie"", Dawkins falha por não discutir realmente as hipóteses alternativas ao seu quadro geral.O livro reafirma uma visão majoritária, e não tem espaço para discussão séria sequer as principais alternativas que emergiam na margem do discurso dominante. Embora não comprometa a clareza de sua explanação, empobrece o olhar do seu leitor (que, como ele mesmo diz, é apenas um leigo esclarecido), dando um noção equivocada de uma explicação definitiva e consensual, quando, na verdade, este é um campo bastante discutível. Faltou respeito à diversidade de interpretações e ao espírito do debate científico. Assim, a obra passa a ser apenas o manifesto de uma das vozes do debate -- a voz predominante. Nega, portanto, importantes evidências de processos direcionais que complementam a aleatoriedade estatística das mutações. Com isso, apresenta ao leitor um modelo excessivamente simplificado da dinâmica genética dos organismos -- convenientemente não mencionando mecanismos que podem por em cheque vários pontos de sua perspectiva. Também oculta importantes processos não-gênicos da formação dos organismos que atuam como ""amortecedores"" ou ""normalizadores"" de mutações, a partir de características holísticas da formação de tecidos, órgãos e do organismo como um todo, que influenciam diretamente as probabilidades de sobrevivência. Encontramos alguns dos melhores momentos da obra quando Dawkins torna sua escrita mais ensaística, com maior liberdade para elaborar hipóteses -- como, por exemplo, no breve trecho em que especula sobre a origem da autoconsciência, cuja causa ser a elaboração de um mapeamento social cuja sofisticação exige a inclusão de um modelo de si mesmo. No último capítulo, ele apresenta a hipótese do Meme -- talvez a principal razão para a popularidade do livro. É um pensamento instigante e deve ter sua parcela de verdade. Porém, sofre do mesmo reducionismo crasso da teoria central. Na verdade, é ainda pior, porque os memes sequer são um fenômeno mensurável, sendo sua definição em termos práticos ainda mais difícil que os próprios genes. "
46,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"This book is a science classic and deserves to be. It is concise and carefully constructed with clear reasoning displayed on each page.Concise. Dawkins never resorts to math, but he mentions from time to time that a particular case really needs to be explained with math rather than in words. I was always terrible at math. I'm still plugging away at it decades after high school just for the fun of challenging my math resistant brain, but I can see Dawkins' point. The symbols of math are strictly defined and a mathematical expression can convey meaning without the ambiguity of words. Math is wonderfully clean. That this book is only two hundred pages long without it is remarkable.There are points where, after an explanation that requires a paragraph or two, Dawkins will remark that his head is spinning, and so will be yours, but these dizzy spells don't occur frequently. The fact is when dealing with genetics, after a generation or two inheritance can become pretty confusing and genetic relationships are central to the book.The word ""selfish"" in the title is misleading because it indicates our genes are thinking and planning for the future. The author in his introduction makes clear that giving sentience to genes is merely a convenient way to describe the results of natural selection so that readers can more easily grasp the concepts. Of course a gene has no awareness, cannot plan for anything and is a pure result of history...a survivor.The standard story of the beginning of life is that billions of years ago there was a soup of chemicals and, with plenty of time to do so, and energy to power chemical interactions, chance combinations occurred that at some point were able to replicate. Some replicators were better replicators than others and won a place in the sun to continue reproducing. Mistakes in reproduction or mutation due to damage from the environment altered these reproducers and, yet again, one version of the reproducer would be better suited, even in a seemingly insignificant way, to survive than another and, to make a very very long time short, here we are!Important to remember is that all of this is done blindly, replicators simply replicate as best they can in the environment in which they find themselves. It is the grim reaper, death, that makes the selection of what replicators will survive to reproduce. It can't be stressed too much that the environment is key to natural selection. We and all other life, are survivors of the historical environments that have, through relentless culling of those less able to survive, shaped life into a myriad of forms that exist today. The fact that all life shares DNA is the clue to the whole process. Variation meets with suitable environments for survival - fish in the sea, birds in the air, bacteria in the soil.Dawkins refers to the bodies of living things as ""survival machines"" and offers the insight that our bodies are carefully controlled environments whose sole purpose from an evolutionary standpoint, is to provide the replicators, the genes, with a sheltered place in which to carry on. Our bodies replace that harsh primordial soup that was so dangerous to the first life.Isn't it easy to see how thinkers in history were so distracted from the real reason for an insect being perfectly matched to the flower it pollinates? It looks like the insect just HAS TO BE designed by an intelligent designer with a purpose in mind - to match it to the flower! It took Darwin and a few others to escape this appealing idea and see that it was the extinction of insects over countless generations, insects that were less suited to the flower, that resulting in an apparently ""perfect"" match for the flower! And don't forget that the generations of flower were being culled to be more suitable to the insect too.Far from intelligent design, our glorious world of living variety came from blind, purposeless, innumerable, random contests between life and the environment. Some live (success), some die (failure), the living reproduce with some tiny modifications, then it's a new contest. Reiterate for billions of years.Though there are points in The Selfish Gene were you might scratch your head, by careful re-reading of a short section you can follow the logic. You won't get lost in jargon because Dawkins is at pains to write for any reader, being nothing if not careful with his prose. Like any good scientist, he never makes blind assertions, always advises caution on points that are not proven and even asks people to dive in and investigate where some concept is not completely proven.My edition is the original from 1976 with a wacky cover design. I've kept it over all these years because I knew I'd want to read it again. As expected it was a great pleasure to do so.Oh, by the way, to give you an idea of just how difficult an idea long time periods are, take a look at this webpage (click on the image if it is too small, to enlarge it):http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-conte..."
47,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880125-dave,5,"I was led to read this book by way of one of those six-degrees-of-separation links that make the world the place that it is... I was watching the excellent documentary ""The Smartest Guys in the Room"" about my former employer, Enron, and it struck with me that the movie mentions ""The Selfish Gene"" as being one of Jeff Skilling's favorite books. A reader of Stephen Jay Gould's, I already had a bit of an interest in genetics and understood the book to expound upon one of my favorite subjects, Darwinism, so I though I'd check it out for myself.Richard Dawkins does a superb job of laying out his logic in a convincing and thorough manner, and there were a number of moments in reading the book that concepts long discarded to the periphery of my knowledge were brought into sharp focus. Some examples include the mechanisms of evolution during the days of the primordial soup, the workings of symbiosis and parasitism (and how and why they cross paths), and the concept of the game the ""Prisoner's Dilemma""(as well as its relation to genetics).I loved this book and would highly recommend to anyone with a slight interest in biology, evolution, or a curiosity for learning more about the fundamental forces at work in our world. I am somewhat amused that Dawkins' assertion, roughly and ineloquently summarized as organisms, including you and me, being the vehicle by which genes keep themselves immortal, is reminiscent of a Vonnegut book I read years ago called Hocus Pocus. More specifically, the similarities are to a book within the book Hocus Pocus, called the Elders of Tralfamadore, which contains one of my favorite sayings, that I say almost every day - ""What germ ever lived a life this full of challenges and opportunities?""Dawkins can be arrogant at times in a way that borders on hubris, but I find that this aspect of his writing is more a mechanism of his deep and considered thought and very quick intellect than of an overinflated ego. That said, it bears keeping in mind during this book that some critical thought and a questioning mind can be helpful in keeping Dawkins' assertions in perspective."

49,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,2,"A Classic Work, But Game Theory Really Just Wore Me DownI've read several books by Richard Dawkins, including  The God Delusion, The Blind Watchmaker, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Greatest Show on Earth. Strangely, I've only now gotten around to his first and most well-known book, The Selfish Gene, and listened to the 30th edition on audiobook as the original was written waaaayyy back in 1976, an eternity when it comes to books on science. To his credit, Dawkins has added numerous end notes for each chapter that amend or expand on the ideas to reflect newer research. The audiobook is also narrated by himself and his wife, which is a nice touch.Nonetheless this was my least favorite of his books, simply because it was impossible to maintain interest when it deep-dived into Game Theory in terms of gene survival strategies. I don't question his conclusions, as I have no expertise or knowledge in that area. It was just a painful slog to listen to the drawn-out and detailed discussions of cooperation, competition, percentages of survival, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps I've been fooling myself in thinking that I will find anything relating to evolutionary and genetic sciences interesting and mind-expanding. Or maybe I just felt cold listening to how clinical gene mechanisms are in the endless struggle for survival, replication, and mutation. I much prefer to hear about the evolutionary strategies of plants, animals, and humans, which I can relate to, rather than DNA and mitochondria, which aren't nearly as warm and fuzzy."
50,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I loved this book! Informative, easy to read and surprisingly up-to-date and current despite having been written more than 30 years ago. The purpose and interest of a gene is to progress to the next generation. The genes that are succesfully passed on proliferate and the ones which do not disappear. This does influence animal and human instinct. Although the influence of genes on human nature isn't mentioned, it's in the message. This is not to say that human beings are without choice or free will, it just means that we are predisposed to react in certain ways. Anyway, this philosophical discussion is nothing Dawkins dwells on and anyone particularly interested should seek out Steven Pinker's ""the blank slate instead.The most fascinatin tidbit of facts is ants - belonging to a group called Hymenoptera which also includes bees and wasps - and their strange relationship to each other. The ""queen"" is an egglaying machine, distributing sperm she collected once to her eggs. The eggs that are not fertilized with sperm are born as males and contain only a single set of chromosomes and no father! Fascinating, I spent half an hour of bedtime gushing over this fact to my fiancé who did not really find this half as interesting as I did. At any rate, this means that the female descendants of one queen, all sisters, share not 1/5 of each other's genes but 3/4's as the male chromosome set is always the same. This also means that these sister workers are extremely interested in keeping the queen breeding more sisters which contain much of the same genes as they do - more genes in fact than offspring would share.So yes, although the general content of this book is now generally known, it is still extremely well worth reading to anyone with least bit of interest in evolution and biology. The beauty is in the details. A glorious achievement!"
51,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371252-louis,5,"Long or short evaluation?If everything remain the same, what would be the evolutionary advantage of a selfish reading gene promoting the writing of short book evaluation over an allele promoting the writing of long book evaluation? Producing a short evaluation would require less resource (time) to his vehicle allowing him more time to read more books. Vehicle may prefer to read many short evaluations in order to select a book to read, which would encourage the reproduction of selfish reading gene for short evaluation. A long evaluation requires more resource to produce, but there might be an advantage to it. A long evaluation requires more reading than a short evaluation and produce a transfer from book reading time to evaluation reading time, after all, reading is reading. Vehicles may decide that long evaluation provides enough summary and will not read entire book. Thus promoting the reading of more long evaluation and implicitly the reproduction of the selfish reading gene for long evaluation.This latest model will not be stable, because if vehicles read only long evaluation but not books, books will disappear and subsequently book evaluation. The stable model, or one of, is certainly a mixture of long, short and anything in between evaluation. OK, so now you have a sketch, which may or may not make sense, of what reading the selfish gene book is about. I really liked the book."
52,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,5,"A must-read classic. It greatly enhanced my mental model of evolution and of biology. The author is humble throughout, not in the dubiously humble sense—but in the respectful-to-science way. It is filled with perspective on the biology that we encounter every day (such as suggesting organs may have evolved as beneficial parasites and eventually merged with the body). Having read a fair amount of Origin of Species (which is fascinating to read as a primary source), I'd say The Selfish Gene is where anyone should start enhancing their understanding of evolutionary biology. He uses all the tools Darwin didn't have at their disposal: game theory, genetics, modern medicine, and many others. It is not dense by any means and scattered throughout the book are stories of animals being dicks, such as a parasite that secretes a hormone to cause its larvae home to never turn butterfly and become abnormally large. Or cuckoos, that lay their eggs in other birds' nests and have some type of irresistibly cute gape that birds of other species will give them food before their own (?!). So many of these questions you've likely had your entire life since learning about evolution have a satisfying answer buried in the book: why did females and males evolve, how did cells start replicating, .."

Just the idea that we exist temporarily so micro organisms can live through us is something difficult to perceive. This book is full of such ideas and it made me uncomfortable at multiple instances.

56,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43282586-mudaser-salam,4,"A largely brilliant book with occasional signs of mediocrity. One of the reasons as to why this book has continously remained a hotspot of scientific discussions and scholarship is because it raises more questions than it answers. This may sound paradoxical but it isn't because this very nature of a 'problem' keeps us yearning for even more and inculcates in us an ever-evolving scientific curiosity.  I have one problem with the book though. The arguments are quite simplistic on a number of occasions ( To cite one example, the conditional strategies of 'hawk', 'dove' and 'bully' in chapter 5 ""Aggression"" to arrive at ESS are too simplistic to occur in nature, where too many variables have to be accounted for). I guess the author is deliberate in this so as to avoid the complex maths that would otherwise have crept in, may be to render the book readable to a vast audience so as to effect scientific curiosity at a greater scale). Nevertheless, some important results do materialise from these simplistic scenarios assumed throughout the book."
57,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,3,"First: I admit that I enjoyed reading this book. Maybe even a misogynist and islamophobe like Dicky Dawkins here can sometimes have good things to say about biology.And also I had one small breakthrough: obviously it makes no sense to think of myself and most of my favorite people as “survival machines for genes,” because we’re by and large miserable failures at reproducing, and are more inclined to support the offspring of another species than even our own kin. But Dawkins suggests: we could instead be survival machines for memes, ideas which infect our minds like viruses and use our voices and writings to disseminate themselves. Touche, Richard, Touche.But here's what bothered me:Dawkins’s masterwork rests on the tautological argument that what-persists is what persists. “Genes” stick around, so they’re the things that survive.This book was written forty years ago (which, we can hope, is why there’s so much talk of “Man”), and we still haven’t figured out what we mean by “gene.” Dawkins tried to decentralize our idea of “who” was in charge by demoting the individual in favor of the gene -- which is smart. But new recognition of how other components of cells function, organize, replicate themselves, as well as our newborn understanding of epigenetics and epistasis, makes me feel like he hasn’t gone far enough in his decentralization. We’re not minions of DNA strands -- the question of “who is in charge” is far more complex than that, and could be told from a variety of angles. (I’m personally hoping someone writes The Selfish Cytoplasm.) The “selfish gene” is actually a platonic idea of a gene. The “gene” is an idealization. Actual DNA is remade, recycled, reshuffled, sloughs itself off in dead cells -- if he’s looking for something constant, he can only rest with this gestalt of a system. The idea of self-replicating DNA. This is why it’s so easy for him to eventually cross over into the categories of “memes.” Like we can all be said to share some “thing” when we share a political leaning, or a religion, or a ditty in our heads. He can reify ""ideas"" because he's already forced to admit that ""gene"" itself is an idea.And about the pseudo-solidity of memes: I can’t help but assume that his willingness to reduce an idea or a belief to “a structure in the nervous system” -- which is shared by all infected persons -- feeds his dogmatic atheism and racist ethnocentrism. If you think, for example, that “Islam” is A Singular Thing, you’re more likely to either be a fundamentalist Muslim, or to call for it to be wiped out like ebola. A more nuanced, flexible, nebulous idea of what ""a"" religion means is, might be the only way humans can live with each other.But before Dawkins explicitly takes on human culture with the somewhat dodgy concept of memes, he does something much worse, which is to skip and blend from biology to anthropology. He puts forward zoological observations within metaphors that encourage us to see them in human culture, which naturalizes systems of oppression.Speaking of how selfish genes build group altruism, he says stupid things like “Money is the formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism,” suggesting that our economic system has primarily natural roots in an evolutionarily-stable genetic tendency. When he’s talking about evolutionarily fit strategies, he makes the disgusting jump to the welfare state, pointing out that people can continue to have babies they can’t afford because those babies won’t starve, in the efficient way that the natural world would take care of ‘the problem.’ 1) This labels money within capitalism as the same thing as biological resources, naturalizing a very unnatural thing. 2) It equates wealth with some kind of genetic fitness -- Dawkins says he supports the idea of a welfare state, but it follows from his argument that ending the welfare state would breed a society where there aren’t any poor people, because “rich guy” genes would take over the gene pool. It would make more sense to point out that our unnatural culture allows botanically illiterate CEOs to still have babies instead of starve as they would in the 'wild.' Dawkins graciously concludes that we shouldn’t blame these parents, since they’re surely too ignorant to know any better. Instead he blames religious leaders who preach against contraception. I am an exuberant fan of contraception -- but that has nothing to do with class. Wealthy babies slurp up far more resources than do the food stamps of the poor. Religion isn’t a phenomenon just of the working class -- and neither is ignorance. The welfare state exists because we recognize we have an extremely unfair (and, for what it’s worth, highly ‘unnatural’) way of dividing up socially-produced resources, and it makes us queasy to think people will have to die for a dumb system.He talks about gender-based strategies in a highly essentializing way. Which might work for other species -- but evolutionary psychologists like Stevey Pinker have picked him up and giddily trumpeted around the pseudoscience of how a population of “coy” females (rather than “fast”) encourages “faithful” males (rather than “philandering”). In the discussion on gender, I found it interesting that rape -- a fairly obvious strategy for 'selfish genes' to replicate themselves -- is never mentioned. This might just be because Dawkins doesn't believe it exists. He also suggests a biological grounding for racism, as an extension of the idea of kin-based altruism. All of this feels like really sloppy science -- a kind of men-are-from-mars pop-psychology that doesn't take into account that there is so much more going on in capitalism, misogyny, and racism than some kind of natural biological response.

60,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12567456-andrew-glynn,1,"Richard Dawkins is not a scientist, but a capitalist ideologue. His major work, The Selfish Gene, precisely embeds capitalism into biology. As science it's nonsense, because the implicit teleology (the goal is the replication of the gene, the organism merely the vehicle) would, in terms of the efficiency requirement in natural selection, create a situation where more complex organisms are inherently less efficient at the fundamental goal. So with that teleology there would be no increase in complexity through the natural selection Dawkins is at pains to protect as the driving force of evolution. in Dawkins' biologism, the more complex the organism, the less valuable. This is the same as the capitalist move from use-value to exchange-value as the goal. Rather than the goal being to produce useful products, the beginning of the process is money as capital, which is turned into products only in order to create more exchange-value, more capital. The capitalist fantasy of a ""frictionless"" economy, i.e. the creation and sale of products with no cost friction, is mirrored in the idea of a ""frictionless"" conversion from exchange-value (genes) to more exchange-value (genes) without the cost of an organism. This embedding of capitalist ideology into biology reduces the value of human beings and other complex organisms to nothing more than an unfortunate cost of exchange, which could ideally be done away with. As a result it also justifies the practical devaluing of human beings in a more fundamental way even than social darwinism. What's the issue with treating human beings as collateral damage in the quest for profit - they're nothing more than a vehicle for self-replicating molecules to achieve their goal of multiplying anyway."

Any intelligent species anywhere in future possessing such a technology would have placed this book where the bible was first found and the world would have been a lot less stupid. But alas, a piece of crap remains the best of the best sellers and 'The selfish gene' needs reviewers like me making such provocative statements to grab attention. 'The selfish gene' is basically science answering questions that were long considered to be at the realms of philosophers and theologians. It asks and anwers why we exist, how we began, what is our purpose, why we love, why we die, why we cheat and why we cannot get away with it and ultimately why human species are so special. The answer to each of these questions lies at the heart of the most revolutionary show on earth... Evolution. This work makes us wonder why we, the general public, know so little of the concept of natural selection. We could only but appreciate its power after this book equips us to understand life on earth from genesis to present just by pure thought. And at the end, Richard Dawkins becomes much like Christopher Nolan and gives us an intellectual orgasm by introducing us to Memes. That's right people... he coined the term much before it was cool. But to really understand memes is to know where natural selection began when it could no longer act on civilised homo sapiens."

I couldn't give it five stars because it occasionally bored the pants off me, and got my hackles up when talking about kin selection and adoption as an anomaly (hey, adopted child here). I'd be interested in more human examples in addition to so many bird and insect studies. Credit to the author for adding endnotes to clarify something or when he was flat-out wrong in the original version of the book, and for acknowledging that cultural evolution may in many cases outweigh (and outpace) genetic evolution.

65,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,4,"What is the fundamental, basic unit of life in our world? Is it each individual in a species? the species as a whole? groups of species that share real estate together? an entire continent, or even the planet itself? In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins argues that the basic unit is the gene, and that natural selection has been ruled by the ways in which genes seek to perpetuate themselves, generation after generation (that’s the “selfish” aspect—not that there is a gene which causes selfishness in anyone; I would have preferred his other title option, The Immortal Gene). Dawkins applies logic to case study after case study from science, building his case that none of us is really an individual in any basic, meaningful sense; rather, each of us is a collection of genes that keep themselves (and in the process, us) going. We don’t need to be these individual collections of genes at all—it’s just the most efficient means natural selection arrived at for keeping the genes going. It sounds like an enormous topic, and it is. But watching Dawkins wrestle with question after question is very entertaining and illuminating.What makes Dawkins so readable here is the combination of his distinctive writing voice and his infectious enthusiasm and delight for learning about the natural world. Books like The Selfish Gene and Lewis Thomas’s The Lives of a Cell in the 1970s opened the way for so many other “science books for us non-scientists” that have come out since. They show that science is never merely a bunch of facts to memorize in class, but instead is always a story that’s unfolding day by day. The story that Dawkins constructs is extremely compelling—regarding everything in the world but humans. When it comes to applying the same principles and equations to humanity, the story is more complicated and less convincing. Dawkins sometimes suggests that there is no real distinction between humanity and any other species, yet he struggles to use the logic of natural selection to explain humans in the same way that it explains everything else. This difficulty is partly because we’re so close to the subject matter, and so it’s harder to see objectively. But it’s also largely because of the nagging fact of consciousness. We think, we analyze, we seem to know ourselves and our environment in ways that no other species does. We can sense the frustration of trying to include humans in the selfish gene discussion when Dawkins writes,Each one of us knows, from the evidence of our own introspection, that, at least in one modern survival machine [humans], this purposiveness has evolved the property we call “consciousness.” I am not philosopher enough to discuss what this means, but fortunately it does not matter for our present purposes because it is easy to talk about machines that behave as if motivated by a purpose, and to leave open the question whether they actually are conscious. (64)But then later: “Are there any good reasons for supposing our own species to be unique? I believe the answer is yes” (245).Though it ultimately doesn’t harm the general flow of The Selfish Gene , this issue of human consciousness, and the question of where exactly we fit into all this, is occasionally troubling. The wonder of Dawkins’s argument, really, is that he can bring us around to his point of view that what “matters” in natural selection is not an individual in a species but the genes within that individual. Still, though: we don’t ourselves intuitively feel that we are fundamentally our genes rather than our whole-person consciousness, do we? Within Dawkins’s very neat, tidy explanation of life on our world, this is the one tension that doesn’t quite go away. We are different: how and why and when did that happen?Whether or not humanity fits nicely into this explanation, most of The Selfish Gene is clearly more focused on other species. Dawkins clarifies this in what was originally the final chapter of the book, “Memes.” But until that clarification, the reader may be forgiven for making the easy leap from “other species” to “humanity,” and then from there to the possibility that Dawkins is approving of cold, horrifying eugenics. This passage, for example:As soon as a runt becomes so small and weak that his expectation of life is reduced to the point where benefit to him due to parental investment is less than half the benefit that the same investment could potentially confer on the other babies, the runt should die gracefully and willingly. He can benefit his genes most by doing so. . . . There should be a point of no return in the career of a runt. Before he reaches this point he should go on struggling. As soon as he reaches it he should give up and preferably let himself be eaten by his litter-mates or his parents. (168–9)Or again: “If a population arrives at an [evolutionarily stable strategy] that drives it extinct, then it goes extinct, and that is just too bad” (242). The middle chapters of the book are full of this kind of logical precision applied to “choices” genes make in the course of their quest for survival: “game theory” kinds of rules about how genetically closely related someone has to be for it to be worth your while to go out of your way to help them, and so forth (and woe to you if you zone out for a page or two in the midst of these chapters, because you will quickly lose track of what’s being argued and why; it’s not a hard book for the general reader, but Dawkins doesn’t let you sit in the back row and sleep through class). Being too ready to apply everything to humans is not going to meet with success, and it’s not what Dawkins intends. As he admits, “man’s way of life is largely determined by culture rather than by genes” (214). There is a lot to unpack in that simple statement, and this is not the book that will even begin to unpack it.In fact, it’s when Dawkins shifts from the central focus of The Selfish Gene to talking about culture and religion that he is at his weakest. If I were reading this book and knew nothing else about him, I would wish that he would keep writing about science but leave off writing about religion. What has actually transpired in his writing career thus makes me sad, and I almost don’t even want to say anything about his views on religion, as expressed in this, his first book. As good as he is at telling the story of science, his opinions about religion (and the related public persona that he has willingly cultivated) seem to have made it nearly impossible for people to calmly discuss what he says. Honestly, I picked up this book because I was interested in reading Dawkins for his reputation as a clear, engaging science writer, and because I believed that this first book didn’t contain the level of animosity toward religion that has become almost his trademark in the years since. That’s all true—religion doesn’t come up very often in the book, and it doesn’t seem very significant to Dawkins for his discussion. However, it does come up, and it is something that I care about, so with all this preamble out of the way, here are a few of my thoughts about it.Dawkins supposes that the only need for God is to help us out with things we don’t understand. In areas where we’re blind to the “real facts,” it’s (for some reason) natural for us to attribute it to God and assume that he knows what’s going on, which relaxes us and makes us more comfortable with the ambiguity and blindness. Thus, if we can figure out some of the ways the universe works, then it should be natural for us to say, “Oh well, now that we can explain it ourselves, what’s the need for God?” It’s an argument that’s a little circular, first assuming that if there’s a God, that God would be thus-and-such kind of a God—in this case, that a God who created the world in a certain way (using evolution, as Dawkins and I would agree) wouldn’t also intend that we gradually figure out that creation process and come to delight in the way the natural world works, also coming to know God better and better, not in spite of but because of the beauty of how the world works and what we learn about it.The fact that God created a world in which we have the creative and intellectual freedom to tell that world’s story in all kinds of ways doesn’t diminish my view of God at all. Dawkins tells a story of the world without God, but that doesn’t prove that there’s no God; it just proves that there are many ways to tell the story of the world. There are some such stories that are definitely wrong (that the world is flat, for example, or that the universe revolves around the earth), and others that seem to us definitely correct. But the existence of God is beyond the scope of the storytelling that Dawkins favors here. That logical approach doesn’t rule out God, but neither can it definitively prove God. There is mystery. It’s a different question, and just as fascinating. It may be possible for people to be “educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought” (372; quoting P. B. Medawar); it may also be possible for people to be educated far beyond their capacity to undertake spiritual thought.In considering people’s reliance on God, Dawkins says that “The ‘everlasting arms’ hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a doctor’s placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary” (250). But if something is effective, why assume that it’s imaginary? Dawkins’s assumption is that only “small minded” people (129) follow religious rules, and then only blindly, even when they know better. And combining this with an idea of the Bible (and scriptures of other faith traditions) as merely a book of rules to be followed blindly, Dawkins easily dismisses religions as unnecessary nonsense. His misreading of the story of “Doubting Thomas,” from John 20, is a truly puzzling way of making the Bible fit his idea of it:Another member of the religious meme complex is called faith. It means blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence. The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison. Thomas demanded evidence. Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence. The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation. The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. (257)Dawkins has missed the important point that in that story: Thomas demands evidence because he’s the only one in the room who hasn’t already seen the evidence. Everyone else had already had their chance to examine the evidence and reach the conclusion they did (v. 24). Jesus’s line, “blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed,” is not about anyone in that room, all of whom were, of course, seeing right at that moment. It means the people who will come generations after the people in that room and will not see Jesus in the same way, so they will be believing based on the evidence that these people have seen and testified as correct. Scientists needn’t repeat every experiment that’s been done, just to verify that it’s still accurate. Rather, they trust that previous scientists were rigorous in their examination of the evidence, and so long as nothing has fundamentally changed to call the results into question, those results remain acceptable and evidence-based beyond the lives of the scientists who first carried it out.Faith is not, as Dawkins says, “a state of mind that leads people to believe something—it doesn’t matter what—in the total absence of supporting evidence” (432). Yes, faith may make intangible connections (the proverbial “leap of faith”), but the faithful person also relies on some evidence that is deemed compelling and supportive. I’m not arguing that nothing bad has ever been done in the name of a religion. But let’s be more nuanced than Dawkins, particularly when “blind faith” is so often the motivator for people demonstrating the “going against the genes” altruism that he hopes humanity will choose. Dawkins writes, “As for me, I am skeptical of all myths. If we want to know where the truth lies in particular cases, we have to look” (301). I agree, and I sense that he is holding himself back from really seeking the truth in this particular case.You see how hard it is not to talk about religion when discussing Dawkins? Anyway, as I said earlier, religion is not as significant a part of this book as my review comments might indicate. Near the end of The Selfish Gene, Dawkins writes, “Let me end with a brief manifesto, a summary of the entire selfish gene/extended phenotype view of life” (342), and nowhere in this summary does the topic of God or religion come up. As a follower of Jesus, I can read this book and thoroughly enjoy what’s to be enjoyed, while considering the author’s opinions on religion and then moving on. I wish more people could take Dawkins in this way, and that Dawkins could have held himself to this genre of writing, where has so much to offer everyone.More than forty years after its initial publication, The Selfish Gene is fascinating and enlightening. For anyone who wants to read it, I highly recommend the fortieth anniversary edition, which includes two additional chapters, a new epilogue, and many pages of notes in which present-Dawkins interacts with his younger self, candidly and graciously pointing out areas where he has been proven wrong (and yes, patting himself on the back for all the areas where he’s been proven right), and pointing toward related research that’s taken place over those forty years. Do not skip these endnotes! They are an amazing conversation, and integral to the book."

Of course, it was only a popular vote and there have been many books with a bigger influence than this one (for example, Darwin’s Origin of Species and Newton’s Principia Mathematica) but The Selfish Gene may have actually been the first really popular science book on biology and evolution that was accessible to the general public. Over 40 years have passed since it was first published in 1976. Nevertheless, this book remains relevant and a true classic among science books.Richard Dawkins explains throughout his book that we (and all life on earth) are just vehicles in the gene's strive for survival. Before, it had been widely considered that natural selection was related to behaviours and characteristics which would contribute to the survival of the individual organism, a species or a group of it through time. Dawkins arguments that in reality it is the gene that has a more predominant role in evolution by natural selection. Additionally, this view of the gene as having a more central role in evolution is also able to explain many of the weird behaviours life on Earth seems to have.Throughout his book Richard Dawkins makes reference and pays homage to the minds that inspired The Selfish Gene. As he says, their theories and ideas had been filled with academic language and mathematics. Dawkins was the one who transformed it into comprehensible text. His writing remains clear and engaging throughout the book, using technical terms and/or metaphors whenever necessary to illustrate his point.The last chapter of The Selfish Gene's first edition concerned ""memes"", a term initially introduced by Dawkins, which was surprising and captivating. This would still be a great last chapter for the book even today. I read the 40th anniversary edition, which has two additional chapters, inspired by The Evolution of Cooperation, by R. Axelrod, and The Extended Phenotype, written by Dawkins himself. Both chapters are great additions.This is an enthralling book that changed the way I view biology and evolution. Before, physics had always been my favorite field of science and I had never been very interested in biology but The Selfish Gene captivated my interest. I will definitely be reading more on evolutionary biology and more from Richard Dawkins in the future."
67,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7943826-moumeeta,5,"The God Delusion was a paradigm-shifting book for me. And The Selfish Gene did a bang up job of cementing my magical realism outlook. It is a tough book to navigate if, like me, you're no science whiz. It took me a while to finish. But I read it thoroughly well. While I marvelled at how much of evolution, biologists today understand, I was saddened by how my school science books had been such a yawn that the most fundamental viewpoints had completely escaped me. Dawkins has an enthusiastic style of writing. That is needed for a subject that can otherwise seem so unexciting. He lays out for the reader, ""the gene's eye-view of Darwinism"". ""And a new way of seeing,....can in its own right make an original contribution to science."" The first chapter, in the words of a curious child, asks ""Why are people?"" ""Living organisms had existed on earth without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" Then he goes on to clarify - ""I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. I stress this...""However, the book has quite a few examples of how, foolishly, humans assume a zero sum game in situations in life when they could actually use them as win-win situations. Though there is no moral lesson here, there is, a Saganian outlook that says' ""wow. Isn't this just mind-blowing?"". The examples of organism behaviour are indeed fascinating. One key idea is the organism as a survival machine, used by the gene, which is the replicator. The gene is selfish but in its struggle to survive can create a whole system of genes which help each other as they depend on the same resources. We differentiate between the parasitic gene and the non-parasitic one. The idea that a human being could be a collection of hundreds of co-dependent organisms, that a virus could have evolved to help spread its genes by making humans sneeze....a lot of incredible information comes your way on reading this book. some excerpts:I suppose the scholars of the Septuagint could at least be said to have started something big when they mistranslated the Hebrew word for ""young woman"" into the Greek word for ""virgin"", coming up with the prophecy: ""Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son...."". Anyway, as we shall see, erratic copying in biological replicators can in a real sense give rise to improvement, and it was essential for the progressive evolution of life that some errors were made.No matter how much wisdom knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means.The logical conclusion to this trend, not yet reached in any species, would be for the genes to give the survival machine a single overall policy instruction: do whatever you think best to keep us alive.Contraception is sometimes attacked as ""unnatural"". So it is, very unnatural. The trouble is, so is the welfare state. I think most of us believe the welfare state is highly desirable. But you cannot have an unnatural welfare state, unless you also have unnatural birth-control, otherwise the end result will be misery even greater that which obtains in nature. The welfare state is perhaps the greatest altruistic system the animal kingdom has ever known. But any altruistic system is inherently unstable, because it is open to abuse by selfish individuals, ready to exploit it.'A woman could not invest fully in her grandchildren if she went on having children of her own. Therefore genes for becoming reproductively infertile in middle age became more numerous, since they were carried in the bodies of grandchildren whose survival was assisted by grandmotherly altruism.The strategy of producing equal numbers of sons and daughters is an evolutionarily stable strategy in the sense that any gene departing from it makes a net loss.A long memory and a capacity for individual recognition are well developed in man. We might therefore expect reciprocal altruism to have played an important part in human evolution. Trivers goes so far as to suggest that many of our psychological characteristics - envy, guilt, gratitude, sympathy etc - have been shaped by natural selection for improved ability to cheat, to detect cheats, and to avoid being thought to be a cheat.if creatures are discovered that boil to death at -100 degrees centigrade, if a form of life is found that is not based on chemistry at all but on electronic reverberating circuits, will there still be any general principle that will be true of all life? Obviously, I do not know, but if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities. The gene, the DNA molecule, happens to be the replicating entity that prevails on our own planet. there may be others. If there are, provided certain other conditions are met, they will almost inevitable tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process.I think that a new kind of replicator has recently emerged on this very planet....it is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far behind......We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.....I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ""gene"".....Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or building arches.I conjecture that co-adapted meme-complexes evolve in the same kind of way as co-adapted gene-complexes. Selection favours memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage.Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite probable that she bears not a single one of the old king's genes......The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leornado, Copernicus and Marconi are still going strong."

The book explains, in an almost frightening manner, how you (and all life around you) is the product of a constant cycle of a bit of randomness (i.e. genetics) combined with millions of years of learning. Slowly but surely, you come to the realization that life, the very core flame that burns inside all of us, is not conscious of itself. We are but a byproduct of some chemicals that happened to come together. It rivals your thoughts on what you felt were decisions that were ""logical"", and breaks them down to reveal that what we see today is a huge survivorship bias; every living cell today exists because hundreds others were in bad situations or made bad decisions. Finally, it tells you why you're ultimately meaningless; the cells in your body do mean something, but you as a soul are not really much more than the combination of those cells.The book is a must-read. It makes you uncomfortable, and in that feeling do you realize how beautiful is the world around you."
69,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,5,"On selfish gene theory: A gene-centric view of evolution Today, it is a common knowledge to the students of life science that all species have evolved from a primordial life form and the course of evolution is shaped by ‘natural selection’. In his phenomenal book published in 1859, ‘On the origin of species’, Charles Darwin presented his idea of natural selection, in which he depicted how individual organisms are engaged in an eternal competition for the limited natural resources, and in the end only the fittest ones survive (More than 99 percent of all species are extinct now).An important fact that needs to be taken into account here is that Darwin had no knowledge of any genetic material transmitting an organism’s hereditary characteristics through its later generations. It is somewhat surprising that he could join the fragments of evidence to formulate his theory without being aware of any genetic material, as molecular evolution is the precursor of phenotypic evolution and precedes phenotypic evolution. Understanding of molecular evolution is quintessential to the understanding of how evolution really works on the level of individual organisms. But where does this selection takes place? In other words, what is the unit of natural selection? Charles Darwin essentially thought that natural selection takes place on the level of individual bodies of the organisms, for he could not see how it could be any other way.But this organism centric viewpoint poses certain problems before us. As for one, if survival of the individual is the sole driving force of evolution, why do we risk our life saving others? Why do we help others in times of grave danger, even at the cost of our own security? Why do we feed others in the time of great famine? Should we not hoard all the wealth and resources in the world to ensure our maximum safety? Why bother about anybody else? Why do we show altruism at all? Among many other questions, an organism-centered view of evolution cannot account for this dilemma.More than a hundred years have passed since Darwin, and now we know better. Let’s take an extended view on evolution. The selfish gene theory:The term ‘selfish gene’ was first coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book ‘The selfish gene’ (1976), and the concept was later delineated in more depth in his book ‘The extended phenotype’ (1982). In contrast to the Darwinian view of the individual organism as unit of natural selection, the selfish gene theory essentially takes gene as the unit of natural selection (This view of gene as the unit of selection was first developed in the works of W. D. Hamilton, Colin Pittendrigh and George C. Williams.)Gene centric view of evolution essentially states that gene (or group of genes) competes with each other to generate the more competent phenotypic characters to promote its own propagation. And thus genes, not individual organisms, set the course of evolution. To put in an analogy, imagine a car race where individual bodies of organisms as racing cars and genes as the driver. Organism’s bodies are used as mere vehicles for the protection and transmission of genes, the ‘survival machines’ of genes. Survival of the individual is less important than the protection of the genes. So in conflict of interest between the individual and its genes, genes will be favored. The more apt an organism (the vehicle for genes) is to survive in a hostile condition, the more protection is exploited by its genes, and that genes are more likely to propagate in the next generation. So, genes in human bodies ensure their safety more firmly than genes in other lower organisms. Because as a whole, intelligent human beings are more capable of surviving in unfavorable conditions by virtue of their intelligence (Generally speaking, this is true. In some cases, cockroaches might have better chances for survival than human beings). It is notable here that a more prolonged life span in individual organisms does not necessarily attribute any great favor to the survival of genes. If you live for a thousand years and do not propagate your genes to the next generation, all your genes die with you. Survival of an individual is critical until it passes its genetic material to its offspring, and the genes are successfully transmitted to the next generation.Now, this gene centered view of evolution can explain many anomalies which previously seemed nonsensical when viewed from the ‘individual selection’ perspective. For example, why do we show altruism? This gene centered view postulates that even if you sacrifice your life for protecting your family in a war or a likewise situation, you might save more of your genes by giving up your life (Your family members share a large portions of your genes). Like I said, survivals of the genes are more vital than survival of an individual organism. Richard Dawkins states in book “The selfish gene”, ‘’Gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals’’Anomalies like the existence of intragenomic conflict, lethal gene(why do lethal gene exists, if it is bad for the ‘individual’?) can also be accounted for from this viewpoint. I hope you enjoy the book. "
70,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6597382-josip-brecak,5,"I have never read a book on biology or evolution so I can say this book is totally outside my comfort zone. So why did I pick it up? Well, my passion is to become the best version of myself, so I wanted a challenge and this book was definitely a challenge. At times I felt like I was reading a textbook, which is on me for my lack of knowledge on this subject. But most of the time I found myself enjoying it! Dawkin's strays away from the mathematics that is related to the subject and whenever he has a chance to be witty he takes it. At times I felt like it could make a good bed time story!I got a little frustrated. Not at that book, but at the people who can't sleep for nights from reading this peace of work. Dawkins does have some ""controversial"" topics which, maybe at times harsh, but throughout this book it is stated that it has not to do with ethics and morals! My dear friend Marcus Aurellius would be disappointed with those who choose not to use the divine seat within him… his rational mind. So when you read this book, remember not to get caught up in your feelings of what is good or bad or come from a place of religious belief. Remember this, Dawkins states that ""human suffering has been caused because to many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use…"" Evolution can be a confusing subject especially for those who aren't familiar with it, but Dawkins simplified it as best as he could for the layman. Here are the main takeaways in my opinion. (I left out some ideas, like nature vs. nuture. )1)This is a book about evolution, but the best way to look at it is in terms not from the individual level, but at the lowest level possible, the gene. The most fundamental thing in order for life to exist is there has to be ""replicator"" (The gene). Life is for those who are able to replicate. If they cannot, they perish. This is a part of us that is immortal. The gene which, is named the ""Immortal Coil.""2)So why do other genes succeed and replicate more than others? Survival of the fittest. No. It is the survival of the most ""stable."" There are three trends nature favors. High longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. These are the practical units for natural selection. Now for the replicators that began to increase in numbers, they're faced with other replicators. So they had to build survival machines. These survival machines our the case that keep these genes safe. So the harsh truth is that we are merely made to keep our genes safe and nothing more and our genes don't have a problem to dispose of us.3)Genes are the policy-makers, but our brain's are the executives, they make the decision. As brains evolve they're able to learn and make simulations. This is why humans compared to other survival machines have an advantage, because we are able to SIMULATE the future rather than go through trial-and-error. 4)The gene is the fundamental unit for ""self-interest,"" and Dawkins believes for a gene to be successful it has to have the quality of ruthless selfishness. So are we inherently selfish? Yes. But why do we help others if we are so inherently selfish? Because sometimes the selfish gene can receive the most selfish benefits through altruistic actions. In the end the nice guy can finish first. To support his hypothesis, Dawkins uses something called ESS. Evolutionary stable strategy, which is backed up by game theory and prisoners dilemma. 5)One of the most interesting subjects he talks about is the ""Memes: The New Replicators."" Here he talks more about what makes us unique and can we really call ourselves unique? The answer is, yes we can. The most unusual thing about man is what we call ""culture."" How does culture arise/transmit? It's similar to the way genes evolve. This ""new soup""; human culture has a new replicator which transmit culture through imitation. What imitation is to a meme, is what replication is to a gene. Examples of memes are tunes, fashion,ideas, catch-phrases, and ideas(,like god.) So he goes on to answer, how does this idea of God replicate. Well through word of mouth, books, music, etc. Remember from point 2 in order for genes to be successful and replicate they have to be stable. So if ideas/memes are like genes, they also have to have the factor of stability. So what makes the idea of God so stable? Well, its psychological appeal. When we die. Even though we are not immortal there are two things we will leave with us. Our genes and our memes. As generations pass our contribution of our genes will be halved and our grandchildren will barely resemble us, or if at all. So our genes maybe immortal in its sense, but we should not seek immortality through reproduction. If we want to ""live"" forever it should be focused on what we can contribute to the world's culture. As human beings we have conscious foresight and we even have the capacity of genuine, uninterested altruism. I'll like to end the summary/review with Dawkins words.""We are built as genes machines and cultured as meme machines. but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."""
71,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Dawkins is a powerful writer. For most, life is complex, full of detail, filled with the the unknown or uncertainties. Dawkins blows through all of this to get to his central point without qualification: Life forms are vehicles for genes to perpetuate themselves. In translation, this means life is ultimately, and solely, focused on its replication. Other life forms are either to be overpowered or to be used for self-interested purposes. All else is but a footnote.By ""life form"" Dawkins also means humans, but here he takes a left turn and goes down a different path by writing that ""We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism - something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."" This perspective I suppose reflects a rational man theory that we, unlike other animals, are free to choose and can control our destiny. But the operative word in this Dawkins' quote is ""can"" as in ""can rebel."" If we are selfish in the way Dawkins describes, what's the motivation to be altruistic? In Dawkins, the basis for selfish gene decision making rests on three legs: We're out for ourselves and we will screw someone else if they are in the way or we will use them if we need to; we tend to our kin because we share the same genes; or we cooperate with others for mutual advantage. Given this Dawkins' perspective, why be altruistic? We know of course that many actually care about the welfare of others regardless of any kin or contractual relationship we have with them. If we start with this factual observation, there's a problem with Dawkins' theory. Taking a cue or two from Darwin, but without getting into the group selection debate, perhaps we are designed to promote the welfare of the whole (think conformity to the group) precisely because others and the group are central to our own individual self-interest. Here we have a selfish gene theory that goes beyond kin selection and reciprocal altruism because it promotes the welfare of others and the solidarity of the group. Perhaps this is the origin of sympathy, empathy, compassion, love, loyalty, respect, sharing, etc. We tend to each other. Even if we don't pick out bugs and such, there are many ways we groom each other. Despite the negative connotations associated with selfish gene theory, Dawkins articulates as well as anyone that our bodies are the very embodiment of cooperation. Selfish gene meets selfish gene and each knocks off the rough edges of the other and finds a way to work together because it's in their interest to do so. The end result is a fully grown body that we see in the mirror every day, pushed by self-interest and supported by an elaborate network of cooperative being. Now this is an interesting perspective. We have the self-oriented in one corner and the other-oriented (in the utilitarian, mutual advantage sort of way) in the other, and this reflects the age-old debate between egoism and cooperation. Dawkins relies on Hamilton's mathematical formulations (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) for the kin selection part of his theory but it's not clear how this relates to genetic variability that is the essence of Darwin's theory. What does it mean to say we are one-half of our mother and father? Could it be that we are more like our mother than our father in certain key traits? Could some of us be more prone to cheat while others are more prone to work for the good of the whole because our own good is tied up with the group's good? Dawkins writes that ""Darwinian selection has to have genetic variation to work on."" He seems to mean by this that natural selection then picks the traits that reflect an ""evolutionarily stable strategy"" so that in the end we all end up the same as a reflection of some universal human nature. Yet, when we look around, we are clearly not the same. We seem to fall somewhere between the twin poles of the self-oriented and other-oriented. Perhaps certain key traits, such as a focus on oneself without regard to the other or on others as well as oneself repeat themselves with each new generation and that such variability goes with the territory of being human. In other words, could there be two equally viable survival strategies for the selfish gene? Could the extremely self-oriented individual succeed by deception, manipulation, and overpowering? Could the other-oriented succeed because the promotion of the good of the whole in turn promotes the good of the self within the group? Dawkins' footnotes are excellent. His writing would benefit if he omitted his not so subtle digs at those who have a different perspective. "
72,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,5,"An immaculate masterpiece of Darwinian synthesis. Written just a couple of decades after the genetic revolution took off, the book combines old and new ideas in evolutionary theory. The majority of the book skilfully popularizes the ideas of Darwin, Mendel, Watson/Crick/Franklin/Wilkins, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith, W.B. Hamilton, Robert Axelrod and other pioneers of the modern evolutionary synthesis. But without the added spark of inspiration and insight that guides Dawkins's pen, the book would be only a backward-looking synthesis (although a very fine one at that). Instead, the book is full of original theories. It thus presents a thought-provoking journey that the author has penned down with unusual vigour and persuasiveness. The very idea of the Selfish Gene was obviously very influential for subsequent theory. It has been debated, vilified and adored. Even if some aspects of the theory have been questioned, e.g. its relegation of the individual members of the species to a subservient evolutionary role compared to the fundamental level of the genes, its importance and theoretical appeal cannot be disputed. Terms like ""gene vehicle"" are still in common use today. Let me just name three more contributions of the book to scientific debate: 1) The Universal Darwinism hypothesis, according to which all life in the universe must develop according to something akin to Darwinian natural selection based upon selfish replicators using ""survival machines"" (bodies and minds) to guide their own prospects. 2) The theory of ""memes"", which has obviously taken a life of its own both in popular culture and in science, according to which ideas and cultural trends operate according to laws of Darwinian survival. Although the memetic theory is rather crude and sketchy, and arguably doesn't add much to existing sociological and anthropological theories, it is a powerful metaphor that can be freely adopted to different contexts, and it can thus serve as fuel for further discoveries in the humanities and social sciences. 3) The hypothesis of the ""Extended Phenotype"", as briefly sketched at the end of the book (in later editions), and as extrapolated in the book by the same name, according to which the physical effect of the genes include their effect on the natural environment outside the narrowly conceived limits of the organism's body, e.g. in beaver dams and human urban development.The book's metaphors can be questioned for some of the shortcuts that they take with regard to the complexity of the issues at stake, and for some of the liberties that they take with regard to the best scientific evidence. The flat-out denial of group selection or of genuine altruism is probably misguided, and the alternative theories should be studied deeper. In a few other respects, the book has dated a little bit, but I was surprised at how little it has. The discussions on altruism and selfishness, on the gene/vehicle struggle for survival, on the parasitic and opportunistic nature of survival machines, and on the impact of genes on social cooperation (e.g. through the evolution of ""tit-for-tat"" reciprocity) still hold up as well as they did back then - mostly because 99% of the sciences and of the general public are still ignorant of the basic facts of the matter. Together with Edward O. Wilson and Stephen Jay Gould, Dawkins has helped popularize and develop Darwinian theory, with oratory splendour, but as this book shows, his contributions are equally immense in the field of original thought, especially with regard to the theoretical underpinnings of biology and the extended philosophy of Darwinism. Still better than almost any other book on the subject out there."
73,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277957-conrad,1,"In the preface to the 1976 edition of The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins tells us that ""[t]his book should be read almost as though it were science fiction. It is designed to appeal to the imagination."" In the first chapter of The Grammar of Science Karl Pearson, the father of modern statistics and the namesake of the Pearson correlation coefficient, gives the following maxim: ""Let me recommend the reader to apply this test to every work professing to give a popular account of any branch of science. If any such work gives a description of the phenomena that appeals to his imagination rather than his reason, then it is bad science."" (Karl Pearson, The Grammar of Science) It seems that at sometime during the previous century writers of popular science have taken to the road of appealing to imagination rather than reason. We are even told that they must do so in order to bolster sales of their popularization. Yet I still find myself agreeing with Karl Pearson, and for this I generally find myself not liking pop science. While I respect Dawkins generally, I find The Selfish Gene a bit too pop science for my taste.Something in particular nagged at me while I read this book, until it hit me around chapter 5. Dawkins' 'gene-centered' view is jargon in search of a deeper meaning. Dawkins states in his preface to the 1989 edition that the gene-centric view ""is a different way of seeing, not a different theory...[T]here are two ways of looking at natural selection, the gene's angle and that of the individual. If properly understood they are equivalent; two views of the same truth."" But why is the gene-centric view needed or helpful? Does it yield new predictions or insights? I remain unconvinced.Stephen J. Gould has warned us to be weary of just-so stories in science, and without enough of the math laden theory or any appeal to empirical evidence, I feel this book comes across as a compilation of just-so stories. The tendency towards too easily accepting just-so stories about how natural selection works, or has worked, is part of Gould's critique of 'adaptationism,' the idea that every aspect of an individual's phenotype can all too easily be explained as an adaptation without the evidence required by each particular case.If you really want to put forth the effort to learn about this type of evolutionary theorizing, let me make a suggestion. My suggestion may not be as easy as reading The Selfish Gene, but I think it is worth the extra effort. At least a few of the topics covered in The Selfish Gene are also covered by a different author without Dawkins' unnecessary gene-centric view. J. Maynard Smith's work Evolution and the Theory of Games covers Smith's own concept of an evolutionary stable state, and the Hawk-Dove-Retaliator type models of evolution with much more clarity. Smith's explanation of these topics is carefully mechanical unlike Dawkins' metaphorical ascription of personified 'selfishness' to inanimate genes. Yes, Evolution and the Theory of Games contains some mathematics, as the title suggests, but all those difficult proofs are relegated to an appendix. And really, how much do you expect to learn without a bit of effort? The mathematics is necessary to really understand the concepts."
74,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719671-frank-peters,2,"The majority of this book was really quite excellent. Nevertheless, the other portions of the book succeeded in detracting from what was otherwise and very good book. The main point of the book was wrapped around game theory, and was a very well thought out description of why certain genetic strategies end up winning. In speaking of genetic strategies, I empathize with Dawkins how he had to continuously remind the reader that the personification of the gene was merely a convenient form of communication, and that the gene clearly has no actual thought. Similarly the author needed to keep reminding us that it is the gene that wants to replicate, not the organism (which is merely used by the gene). The best part of the book started in about Chapters 4-5, when game theory was introduced, and from then on the game theory discussion were interesting and valuable. The largest detractor for me in this book started in the very first paragraph where Dawkins demonstrated his excessive arrogance: he suggested that a sign of real modern advancement in a society is when it acknowledges evolution (by which Dawkins means everything from the beginning of life to the evolution that we see around us daily). Based on his rules, 1950s Soviet Union and China would be very modern, while 2010 USA would not be. I think Quantum Theory would be a much better measurement (here I am demonstrating my Physics arrogance). Dawkins also irritated me by claiming that he was only going to discuss real science (but without the maths), and then went on to discuss areas that are purely wishful thinking. His description of the beginning of life in the pre-biotic soup is entirely speculation, and is not based on any real science that I am aware of. Similarly his meme theory, while a creative proposal, was also not scientific. Thus, as the master of propaganda that Dawkins is, he creatively mixed a small minority of his wishful thinking in with a large amount of good science, while claiming that the entirety was proven and accepted science. Thus, the book ultimately reminds me of the movie Zeitgeist. "
75,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,2,"I almost gave this three stars and then thought... nah. 2.My issue with the book is that it presumes selfishness is something that exists outside of the human mind. The entire framework casts all of Darwinism's natural selection in terms of survival of the fittest. That existence is necessarily selfish because the act of self is selfish. This is so western. In contrast, a Daoist perspective might be more like... this is the environment that happened. You just happened. Therefore.... it just is. As a state of just being, this is what survived and did not. Then things changed, and it turned out this other thing is what became more abundance, but all of that just is what it is, not the animals were selfish.In short, I just feel he overstretched the word. Hence, his retelling of all the different selfish animals and their acts of selfishness, from bees to varieties of shellfish, just sounded depressingly sad to me. I think often, humanity forgets how impacted its philosophy is by scientific discoveries. To me science is a church... and sometimes science doesn't know where to chill out. I mean, I love a good scientific theory. But to think in terms of animals acting selfishly is to anthropomorphize the world to justify things that are just kind of ... not quite as self-evident in nature, let alone human nature. So... 2 stars for me, b/c so many people like this and believe this, I can't help but think of how sad it means their world is."

Which is cool and all, just not what I was expecting.Pretty fascinating shit, actually... Dawkins' revolutionary theory basically revealed that the meaning of life is defined by our genes' ""desire"" to replicate themselves. In other words, it's not that we, as individuals or ""vehicles"" are looking to duplicate ourselves, but the genes themselves are just using us as vehicles by which to spread themselves. He argues that altruism isn't natural urge--at least, not for its own sake. Creepy, eh?Whatever, obviously the book is more complex and interesting than this, but this is a GoodReads entry.

Only after the New York Review of Books compared the impact on the reviewer of my own book Beyond Words to The Selfish Gene did I get interested in actually visiting Dawkins' landmark book. I was not only disappointed; I was rather dismayed! The premise of this book is fundamentally flawed. Individual genes are in no position to act selfish, even metaphorically. The impression the book gives (despite various wiggle-statements by author Dawkins) is that ""selfishness is in our genes."" But real biology isn't so simple, nor as reducible to simple mathematical computer models, as Dawkins insists. Dawkins argues like a lawyer, rather than exploring like a scientist. Having read the book, I am considering writing more on this topic."

The author gave no credit to the reader for having any sort of intelligence. Instead of describing a theory and offering an example or two, he continually beat the reader over the head with explanations as if they were too dense to understand his point. There was also considerable text devoted to arguing his case against a competing theory that would have been better argued in the scientific literature. All in all, it was painful to finish and the author came across as self-serving and pompous. He may well be neither of these things, but his writing style left a lot to be desired."

I feel that this book should be read by absolutely any literate person on the planet. My reasoning is fairly transparent. Arguably, The Selfish Gene presents Evolutionism in a fairly simple manner. Considering that it is not often enough taught well in schools or in some cases taught at all, this should be a go to book for any uninitiated person. The way it's written makes it accessible and pleasant enough to read. That said, there isn't a fixed page quota. It can be read in 2 or 3 sits, but it depends on who's reading it. "

84,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334405-amun-mohamed-elbadwihi,4,"In 1859, Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, forever changing our understanding of life. As revolutionary as it was, parts of it were wrong, and for a good reason. Darwin, 150 years ago, was ignorant of the existence of DNA, and of genes. Had he been alive today, his theory of Natural Selection—which took 20 years to develop!—might’ve looked very different. Darwin’s dead, though, so thank nature for Dawkins.The title of this book has caused Richard Dawkins a great deal of unwanted trouble. He has, on many occasions, expressed regret over not calling it by a different name, such as “The Immortal Gene”. If you haven’t read the book, I’d suggest that you avoid coming to conclusions based on the title alone.Dawkins postulates that the basic unit of selection in nature is the (immortal) gene, not the organism. Genes in your body need to survive and propagate themselves, for the benefit of themselves, not for the benefit of you. It doesn’t matter if you live or die; although it’s best if you die after you reproduce, so your genes get a chance to move along. In essence, we are all just disposable vehicles for gene survival. I’m OK with that. And also a little flabbergasted. Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, and I cannot speak enough about how much of an amazing writer he is. I owe much of my understanding of the world to this incredible scientist, and I’d recommend anything written by him in a heartbeat. Some tidbits:

“Let me begin with some second thoughts about the title.”“It was created inside one of your father’s testicles”“‘A chicken is the egg’s way of making another egg.’” – Peter Medawar, Review“Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain’s simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.”“‘The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner.’ My colleague John Krebs and I have dubbed this the ‘life/dinner principle’.”“One of the dominant messages of The Selfish Gene (reinforced by the title essay of A Devil’s Chaplain) is that we should not derive our values from Darwinism, unless it is with a negative sign. Our brains have evolved to the point where we are capable of rebelling against our selfish genes. The fact that we can do so is made obvious by our use of contraceptives. The same principle can and should work on a wider scale.”“I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. I stress this, because I know I am in danger of being misunderstood by those people, all too numerous, who cannot distinguish a statement of belief in what is the case from an advocacy of what ought to be the case. […] Let us try to teach generosity and altruism […..] it is a fallacy—incidentally a very common one—to suppose that genetically inherited traits are by definition fixed and unmodifiable.”“The feeling that members of one’s own species deserve special moral consideration as compared with members of other species is old and deep. Killing people outside war is the most seriously-regarded crime ordinarily committed. The only thing more strongly forbidden by our culture is eating people (even if they are already dead). We enjoy eating members of other species, however. Many of us shrink from judicial execution of even the most horrible human criminals, while we cheerfully countenance the shooting without trial of fairly mild animal pests. Indeed we kill members of other harmless species as a means of recreation and amusement. A human foetus, with no more human feeling than an amoeba, enjoys a reverence and legal protection far in excess of those granted to an adult chimpanzee. Yet the chimp feels and thinks and—according to recent experimental evidence—may even be capable of learning a form of human language. The foetus belongs to our own species, and is instantly accorded special privileges and rights because of it.”“Genes do indirectly control the manufacture of bodies, and the influence is strictly one way: acquired characteristics are not inherited. No matter how much knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means. Each new generation starts from scratch. A body is the genes’ way of preserving the genes unaltered.”“The gadget that animals evolved to achieve rapid movement was the muscle. Muscles are engines which, like the steam engine and the internal combustion engine, use energy stored in chemical fuel to generate mechanical movement.”  “Fireflies (which are really beetles) attract their mates by flashing lights at them. Each species has its own particular dot-dash flashing pattern, which prevents confusion between species, and consequent harmful hybridization. Just as sailors look out for the flash patterns of particular lighthouses, so fireflies seek the coded flash patterns of their own species. Females of the genus Photuris have ‘discovered’ that they can lure males of the genus Photinus if they imitate the flashing code of a Photinus female. This they do, and when a Photinus male is fooled by the lie into approaching, he is summarily eaten by the Photuris female.”“There are honeyguides who, like cuckoos, lay their eggs in the nests of other species. The baby honeyguide is equipped with a sharp, hooked beak. As soon as he hatches out, while he is still blind, naked, and otherwise helpless, he scythes and slashes his foster brothers and sisters to death: dead brothers do not compete for food! The familiar British cuckoo achieves the same result in a slightly different way.”“I have already suggested that a female might refuse to copulate with a male who has not already built her a nest, or at least helped her to build a nest. It is indeed the case that in many monogamous birds copulation does not take place until after the nest is built. The effect of this is that at the moment of conception the male has invested a good deal more in the child than just his cheap sperms.” “The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to ‘memory’, or to the French word même. It should be pronounced to rhyme with ‘cream’.”

86,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,5,"Last night I went to hear Richard Dawkins and Carolyn Porco speak in Nashville, TN. There was a great turnout, and I waited in a long line to get both of them to sign my copy of The Selfish Gene, so I thought today would be a good day to write my review of this masterpiece. I have read this once and listened to the audio book once. The audio book was the 40th anniversary addition, which had lots of additional commentary. By visiting it a second time, I picked up on things that I missed out on or forgot about. This is my favorite book by Dawkins, the best science book I've ever read, and in my top 10 favorite books of all time. His books have made me obsessed with evolutionary biology. From Introduction to 30th Anniversary Edition - ""Audiences respond to the new book, whichever one it is, with gratifying enthusiasm, applaud politely and ask intelligent questions. Then they line up to buy and have me sign...The Selfish Gene.""The event played out exactly as he described it. The new book was Science in the Soul, which I had read, and thought was great. In fact, I read and loved every book they had on display. But The Selfish Gene was the obvious choice to buy and get signed. Another thing he talks about in the Introduction is that perhaps ""The Selfish Gene"" wasn't a great title. One of his colleagues mentioned that ""selfish"" was an unappealing word and that ""The Immortal Gene"" might have been a better title. I personally think ""The Selfish Gene"" is a perfect title because it accurately describes the content. Although individual organisms can act altruistically, genes act selfishly, caring only about perpetuating themselves through the eons. The book doesn't promote selfishness as a basis for morality. He's not Ayn Rand.From Chapter 1 - ""Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence. If superior creatures from space ever visit earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess the level of our civilization, is: 'Have they discovered evolution yet?' Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" I had to share this because it's just an awesome quote. Chapter 2 tries to answer a tough question: How did life come from non-life? Science can't fully explain this phenomenon, but Dawkins makes a bold attempt. At some point, units of matter started making copies, or replications, of themselves. The copies started making copies, and so forth. Mutations happened, causing the copies to become varied and more complex. They start to build containers around themselves for protection and to aid in their replication. These containers are now what we consider to be our bodies. If you don't read anything else in this book, I suggest you at least read this chapter.The book goes on to explain how genes manipulate organisms to do their will. An organism wants to reproduce so it can spread its own genes. It also will act altruistically towards other organisms who share its own genes. For instance, a parent will often sacrifice its own life for the benefit of a child who shares half its genes. Cousins share a smaller portion of genes, so individuals have less concern for those more distant relatives. But they will often make sacrifices for the good of a group that carries a large amount of the same genes. The book explains many situations like these in detail.The term ""meme"" is popular now among Facebook users, but Dawkins coined that term way back in 1976 when this book was written. Dawkins's ""meme"" is an idea that replicates itself in human brains. Before humans evolved, genes were the only things that could make copies of themselves, using bodies as vehicles. Because of human culture, memes can now make copies of themselves when one person puts their own thought into another's head, and so forth. Religion is the first meme that I usually think of, but political ideologies are strong memes as well.Dawkins is an outspoken atheist and has received more than his fair share of criticism for this stance, even here on Goodreads. But the vast majority of this book deals with biology, not religion. People who dislike his smug attitude towards religion should take their anger out on the man himself, not this book. Haven't you ever heard of separating the art from the artist? Another thing that I disagree with is the attitude that science is boring. Dawkins was the man who taught me that science can be interesting and exciting."

89,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12174361-krishna,5,"Dawkins wrote this book ""to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism"" (p. 1). Despite the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution, biology presents some difficult-to-explain paradoxes: if organisms succeed by ruthlessly exploiting all available resources to survive and reproduce, why do some animals display altruism, or self-sacrificing behaviors for the benefit of others? Why do animals cooperate? Why do some animals withdraw from conflict even if it means giving up opportunities to eat or mate? Why do organisms voluntarily limit the number of their offspring? The conventional explanation is group selection, the view that species in which altruism and cooperation evolved are able to survive and propagate better, which reinforces such behaviors. Dawkins firmly rejects that view. According to him, the unit of selection is the individual and not the species (only individuals reproduce, not the species). Even if a species is altruistic, individuals can improve their chances of survival and reproduction by cheating - by benefiting from the altruism of others while subtly withholding those benefits from others. As the cheater genes proliferate in the population, altruism eventually dies out. Thus we come to the idea of the ""selfish gene,"" the original replicator. More accurately, the replicator is the cistron, a group of genes that ""travel"" together and perform a specific behavior. To further their chances of survival, a collectivity of genes (the genotype) build bodies (""survival machines"" or the phenotypes) that are endowed with the behaviors that will enable them (and therefore their genes) to survive. The concept of a ""survival machine"" itself is highly interesting. Dawkins cites the plot of a British television serial, A for Andromeda, written by the cosmologist Fred Hoyle. In it, and extraterrestrial civilization is bent on galactic conquest but finds distances too big to bridge. It beams out the instructions for the construction of a gigantic computer to be built. Once built, the computer will take over the local civilization; it will also be intelligent enough to defeat all attempts to dismantle it, no longer needing instructions from its designers. Unwitting humans intercept the transmission and proceed to build the computer according to the instructions, and drama ensues. Dawkins argues that organisms are such ""survival machines."" The DNA is the ""program"" allowing a body to be built with physical endowments and behaviors that will enable it to survive, and therefore allow its genotype to survive and propagate as well. Our behaviors - competitiveness, avarice, greed, aggression, jealousy, deception, as well as cooperation and altruism - are intended to improve the chances of survival and reproduction of the genes. If a behavior or attribute did not contribute to reproductive fitness, it will be ruthlessly eliminated from the gene pool. Ironically, a selfish gene may not even be interested in the survival of the organism that houses it, as long as its own chances of reproduction are improved. In Chapter 13, Dawkins gives the example of the T gene in mice. Normally, in meiosis, each allele (alternate form of a gene) in a pair will have an equal chance of being present in a sperm or egg. But in male mice with a T gene present, 95 percent of sperm contain the T gene and only 5% the variant allele. The problem is that if a mouse ended up with two T genes, it is rendered sterile or dies young. The T gene's selfishness causes a high percent of individuals containing it to die, but the gene itself propagates through the population since it as a 95:5 advantage.To survive, an organism needs to do three things. First, it needs to survive. In the primordial soup of the early Earth, various molecules emerged but most were unstable and rapidly decomposed back into their constituents. Dawkins explains that the ""first form of natural selection was simply a selection of stable forms and a rejection of unstable forms"" (p. 13). Once established, the organism needs to reproduce -- i.e. make copies of itself. Fecundity, or frequency of reproduction becomes a factor here. And third, to be successful, the copying needs to be faithful. The offspring need to be as identical to the parent as possible, i.e. copy fidelity. The earliest ""life forms"" that emerged from the primordial soup were probably simple molecules that remained stable and grew by attaching stray molecules to itself. Eventually they began to replicate. Perhaps long strings broke in the middle, and both strings began attaching new material at their ends. But the primordial soup soon ran low on the raw materials. Mechanisms emerged that allowed strings to break up rival molecules and use the freed-up raw materials to build their own bodies (the first predators). But sometimes copying mistakes happened. If a mistake made the string better able to survive and replicate, it spread. If the mistake made the string worse off, it died out. Gradually, these life forms grew more complex -- acquiring defensive outer coatings, mechanisms to produce ""poisons"" to deter predators, other chemicals that can penetrate the defenses of predators and competitors, etc. And thus, step by step, life progressed up the chain of evolution.Subsequent chapters take up questions that have puzzled biologists for generations. If the strongest often win food and mating opportunities, why do some animals avoid conflict? Why do some of the most fierce predators such as lions never fight to the death, engaging in mock fights with a lot of snarling, and posturing and baring of claws but little physical contact? Dawkins utilizes game theory to examine this. The answer is that actual fighting with another animal as lethally armed as yourself can have debilitating consequences for oneself, injury or even death, which can really crimp your reproductive fitness. In a population of ""hawks,"" therefore, a ""dove"" that avoids conflict and bides its time might have a chance at survival and reproduction. So the population of doves keeps increasing - but not indefinitely, since as the number of doves increases, hawks increase their chances of victorious encounters and the balance shifts in favor of the hawks. Thus an equilibrium emerges in which both hawks and doves survive in a stable proportion in the population. This brings us to the concept of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), defined as ""a strategy, which if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by an alternative strategy"" (p. 69). This is simply a strategy which is immune to deviations by some members - anyone deviating from the strategy is made worse off and the population reverts to its original configuration. Another chapters tackles the problem of altruism - why do some individuals sacrifice themselves for others in the group? Shouldn't such behaviors, that doom an individual's chances of propagating her genes, have evolved out of the population? Dawkins explains this with ""kin selection."" Since closely related individuals share a large proportion of their genes, someone who sacrifices themselves to aid the survival of closely related individuals can still propagate their genes into the next generation. For example, since siblings share 50 percent of their genes, a man who dies saving two of his brothers comes out even in evolutionary terms. There is a nifty equation to calculate the percentage of genes shared between two individuals: go up the family tree by generation until you hit a common ancestor, and the down to the other person. Count the number of steps up and down, this is n. Then if number of common ancestors is K, the fraction is K x (1/2)^n. For example, first cousins are separated by 4 generation steps -- two up to the grandparent, and then 2 down to the cousin. But there are 2 common ancestors, grandpa and grand ma. So the fraction will be 2 x (1/2)^4 = 1/8. Your grandpa and you share 1/4 (since the common ancestor is grandpa himself, n = 2, k = 1). The same logic explains why individuals forego reproductive opportunities, or refuse to breed or kill offspring in times of famine. The goal is not to maximize the number of offspring, but to maximize the number of *surviving* offspring. Other chapters examine the battle of the sexes or between generations -- in each case, the same argument prevails. Individuals behave in ways that maximize the chances of survival of their genes, either through improving the odds of survival of their offspring, or of themselves, or ideally of both. Another fascinating chapter examines social species in which most individuals forego their chances of breeding in order to support a highly related individual (the queen). But perhaps the most fascinating chapter is the last one, in which Dawkins introduces the concept of the ""extended phenotype."" The conventional understanding of the gene is that it is the design blueprint for the phenotype - the body of the organism. But the effect of the genes is not confined to the organism's body alone. What about biologically coded behaviors such as nest-building and the construction of tubular homes (the tiny caddis larva). These too are part of the gene's survival strategies. But even more interesting are an organism's effects on other species in its environment - such as unions symbiotic and parasitism. For example, a parasitic fungus makes a species of Amazonian ant climb underneath a leaf and attach itself, until it dies and its head explodes scattering the spores. In this case, the DNA of the fungus codes for this behavior not in its own body but that of another species. This is what Dawkins calls the extended phenotype. Another insight from this chapter is what Dawkins says about the means of reproduction and the symbiotic or parasitic relationship. If the means of reproduction of the parasite and the host coincide (for example, a bacterial parasite in the ambrosia beetle has learned how to hitch a ride in the beetle's reproductive cells and into the body of a new host), the two organisms cooperate to ensure the survival and reproductive success of the host. If the means of reproduction are different (as in the case of the Amazonian ant parasitic fungus), the parasite reproduces to the detriment of its host. Which brings up another fascinating insight - there is no real way of differentiating between ""our"" DNA and that of other species who have figured out how to reproduce themselves using our reproductive cells. In fact, a good portion of any creature's DNA might have been parasitic once, until they worked out a modus vivendi. This may also explain why long stretches of an organism's DNA do not appear to do anything specific - they are parasitic DNA that have worked out how to ensure their own survival. Dawkins's book points the way to profound philosophical, even spiritual truths. If individual phenotypic traits are the workings-out of genetic blueprints shared not only by a species but by all life, it brings into question fundamental ideas of self-hood and individualism. Jealousy, lust, greed, pride and discontent are only the ""survival machine's"" encoded behaviors to enable individuals to go out and perpetuate their genetic masters. Our genes literally make us unhappy and discontented in order to ensure their survival and perpetuation - since happy and self-satisfied individuals pursue no mates, steal no wealth and build no empires. Such a perspective is truly liberating, since it allows us to say ""no"" to the insistent cravings engendered by our gene's quest for survival. Ironically thus, a purely mechanistic view of nature allows us to realize true spiritual liberation."
