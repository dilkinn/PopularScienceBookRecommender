0,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647539-kewpie,5,"This book will teach the budding elementary school aged geek some of the newest theories about black holes. It will teach adults about Stephen Hawking's playful mind and sense of humor. This book was written for those pre-geek second and third graders who read all the astronomy books in the j520 section of the library and then pester their parents, teachers and school librarians about the big bang, black holes, comets and life on other planets. I've done stints in elementary school libraries and there are plenty of these kids. Perhaps some adults may think the story is too young for the science presented -- but I bet these adults haven't worked in school libraries. They don't know about the one ""weird kid"" who seems to be in almost every second and third grade class in every school in the nation who craves to know the inner workings of the universe and is frustrated that most adults they encounter don't seem to know or care about the questions they have.My cousin and I were those ""weird kids"" in our classes. We were mad about science and played ""Let's Pretend"" long after the other kids our age quit. I can totally imagine him and I pretending that we had an amazing computer that zoomed us out into space and allowed us to ride a comet around the solar system. And in reality, I remember us pretending that we were falling into a black hole at some point. When I read this book, I felt as if I were eight years old again. I would have LOVED this book. It would have been next to the ""Brown Paper School Book"" series that I treasured. I felt like I was snooping in on someone else's ""Let's Pretend"" game. "
1,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309661-john,1,"Wow, what a disappointment. Hawking stoops (in both the avian and, to judge from the result, aristocratic senses of the word) to conquer a young audience, and lands hard on his beak.This SF tale is festooned with science lessons, and is plainly intended to convince young readers of the importance of knowing the laws of physics--yet those laws are blown off over and over as the story goes along. Furthermore, there are these huge gaps in internal logic--for instance, young George's parents are such eco-activists that they refuse to allow a TV, telephone or computer in the house, but see nothing wrong with constructing a home made electric generator (I wonder what it runs on!).And, considering that two of the three authors are trained scientists, their grasp on basic astro-facts is pretty shaky; they claim that the moon Ganymede is about the size of Earth's Moon, and elsewhere that a person exposed to space would freeze in an instant--both of which are wrong. I read this as an ARC, and maybe the latter will be corrected in the final version (one can always hope). Still, how hard would it have been to set the story in our actual universe, where lightspeed is a limit and planets are actually far apart to underpin the science instruction? The book'll probably sell well. Too bad, because it's lazy work and disrespectful of its intended audience."
2,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67016485-sophie-crane,5,"This book is a great introduction to some basic science about how the stars and planets form, told incidentally as part of an adventure. Interspersed with science facts and with s some great photos of planets etc at the end of the book. A book by Stephen Hawkings that you can read to the end ;-)"
3,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19346652-laura,1,"This is a banal and rudimentary story that shamelessly exploits Stephen Hawking’s reputation in order to increase sales. It tells the story of a young boy from an anti-technology family who goes on a wild ride through the universe with help of his neighbour’s supercomputer. This whole book is excessively didactic. The whole point seems to be to ram it down readers’ throats that science is wonderful and people who oppose technology are ignorant fools. The portrayal of the anti-science family is woefully patronising.The narrative is interspersed with short factual sections describing the features of various astronomical bodies. But these sections are 100% skippable. Kids are not dense and they won't be tricked into reading their science textbooks simply because sections have been inserted into a novel. More importantly, the narrative actually makes conspicuous scientific errors! For example, one character claims that if a human went into outer space without a spacesuit they would freeze solid in a few seconds flat. Anyone who has ever drunk hot soup from a thermos can confidently attest that THAT’S NOT HOW VACUUMS WORK. In actuality, vacuums - whether the vacuum of space or the vacuum seal inside a thermos - are highly efficient thermal insulators. The fact that such an egregious error remains makes it perfectly obvious that Stephen Hawking actually didn’t have much to do with the writing of this book at all. His name appears to have been used simply to capitalise on his fame.The story features flat characters and routine plotting. For a book that’s supposedly about getting kids interested in actual science, I seriously question the use of so many science-fiction elements. Wouldn’t it have been more effective to show how remarkable real science is, instead of creating nonsense fantasy?"

5,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808903-kristy,4,"My 7-year-old really liked this chapter book. It's by Lucy and Stephen Hawking, and although it's fiction, it includes pages of data and full-color photos and images of space. It's a fun story. The writing is not the best I've read. Bits of the story annoy me. The sets of parents in the book are basically ridiculed for their different styles of parenting and the characters are pretty flat. BUT, it's still a good read for this age and has my child begging for more from STEPHEN HAWKING. So it's a win. There are sequels, too.I read most of this aloud to my son but he read several chapters himself. If I had to put a number on it, I'd say it's a third-grade reading level for reading to self. Our second grader can read and comprehend it on his own but doesn't have the stamina to read the whole thing to himself."
6,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/827224-emily,4,"I read this aloud with my 8 year old who is very interested in space. She now wants her own Cosmos so she can go anywhere in the universe. This was a very fun read aloud and we both learned something new about the universe. Paired with the show Cosmos and a few other additional books about space, this made a great spine for our space unit. "
7,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63883678-vartika,4,"I love children's books. I want to write some myself, and when someone offers to let me borrow their copy of a book for children written by Stephen  and  Lucy Hawking, I'm more than game.  George's Secret Key to the Universe  is a thoroughly enjoyable and informative novel about a boy's friendship and adventures with a scientist named Eric, his daughter Annie, and Cosmos, the most amazing computer in the world. This book not only takes one to an adventure through asteroid belts and black holes; it also stresses on the need to reconcile the need for climate and ecological action with science and technology (and the need to look for an alternative one can return from rather than move onto post-abandonment). In that sense, this is a book that seeks to imbibe responsibility in the reader; and even through self-sacrifice (of the possibility of winning at the science competition). Even though I probably wouldn't have understood these things explicitly, little me would have LOVED this book. Sure, there are elements of formulaic sci-fi stories — the stark demarcation of good and evil, the easy resolution and the picture of eccentricity — but the book itself speaks of understanding the difference between ""science fiction and science fact"". There are also many reinforced stereotypes; gender roles and such; but I guess that isn't one's primary focus when writing a book about bringing together our world with a whole new one — even for children.I still loved this book, and wonder which of Lucy and Stephen came up with the idea of broccoli muffins."
8,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1282017-amanda,1,"I really thought this one was terrible. The science was interesting, but too much like science fiction, so that it seemed like fantasy. The writing was good enough, but some of the themes were disturbing. I think the ending was supposed to be a coming-together of all the different factions, but it message of the book seemed to be that environmentalists are against all technology and innovation, and that it’s okay if we destroy this planet because science can find us a new one.I would love someone to explain to me the visual references to  The Little Prince. They were far too obvious to be accidental, and yet nothing was really made of them. I just can’t see George as a modern-day Little Prince.The book design was atrocious. My reading was often disrupted mid-sentence by sidebars and pages of photographs. I enjoyed the sidebars- they were better than the story, but the placement of them was problematic. Likewise, the photos were cool, but they weren’t placed near the relevant content in the book, and often came in the middle of the chapter. When I reached the end of the photos, I had to go back and reread the last page of text to get back into the story. We’ve made such strides in design recently, that there’s really no excuse for this.It always makes me sad when books like this get so much press because of their authors when so many wonderful books are ignored."
9,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32215065-sleepover137,4,A very good children's book that I will definitely give to my potential future children!
10,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106830613-titanic-lego-boy,5,"Great book, great story and great characters. Loved it from start to finish!"
11,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1543508-paloma,5," What an easy way to study science in a intresting book. During the reading I learned things that I never thought would. Educational science was the principal idea of Lucy and Stephen the authors of this book. We should take care of our planet because if we dont it will be better difficult for us humans to find another place to leave. George secret key to the universe is a book that helps us reflect in our actions towards our planet. A lot of information is being transmitted to us thanks to the knowledge of scientists and the wonderful job of Lucy and Stephen. George helps us understand that we need everyones help because eventhough one can make a difference the planet consequences is everyones foult. I like when George discuses the difficult way to find a planet where to live if we keep acting like we are doing. A funny consequence that george gives us is that if we go to live to Mercury, one day lasts four 59 days of our earths day. Imagine that, if one day at school lasted 59 days that will be prety awful!!! "
12,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65363316-rona,5,I loved this book and also the other books in the series!It really made me want to read more and more!The series taught me a lot about space and the universe and really enriched my knowledge.It sounds really fun to be able to travel to space whenever you want through a portal. I loved the book and really recommend the series for everybody and especially to space and adventure lovers.I hope you read the and like it.
13,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85707191-yoo-yoo,5,"This book was very informative about outer space while providing an exciting story. I first came to this book when I realized the amazing scientist Stephen Hawking participated to write this book. At first, I thought the book would be a fact-packed scientific book but I was wrong. It had an exciting storyline and I believe that I learned plenty from this book. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is willing to read an educational and interesting book."
14,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447538-qt,3,"Pleasant adventure, with lots of humor and scientific information. I loved the actual photos of astronomical objects, and also the cute illustrations."

16,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119388182-yassin,5,Nice book all about outer space
17,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22805655-beth,5,"Without a doubt, 5 stars!So, I didn't know about this book until two months ago. When I was teaching Year Four, one of my topics was space (stargazers). I did not want to read the book on the curriculum map, which looked so dull, and had nothing to do with space. I begged my class teacher for a different book and I was only allowed a different book if I could find a better space-themed replacement. After ten minutes of searching on book websites recommended for primary-aged children, I found this. Surely, I should have already known about this book. Me: self-proclaimed children's literature lover and a huge Doctor Who fan. Somehow, it slipped my radar. The quote from the Sunday times is:  like a Doctor Who adventure  and they are not wrong. This book is amazing. It is so educational: filled with fact files and real-life photographs throughout but it also intertwines the key knowledge throughout the plot. I've honestly learned so much about the Universe from this book that I previously didn't know about and I think it is brilliant. The Hawkings' skills remind me of Riordan and his ability to intertwine facts/knowledge into the plot. I think it is definitely a difficult skill as I've read many books, which are really trying to do it but end up like an encyclopedia. The Hawkings have definitely achieved it. I loved the characterisation, the setting and (did I mention?) the plot! There were sensitive topics dealt with: divorce, being different, bullying (and there's even a hint that someone's died) but they are all dealt with so well that I think it really works. It is really hard to crack children's literature because the writing needs to be just right and I definitely think this works.Never mind just for children, I LOVED THIS. As a Doctor Who fan, who loves space, I was enthralled in this book and I didn't feel too intimidated as is sometime possible with science fiction. This book is really approachable and you don't have to be a child to read this book because it's really good.I even cried at the end. No spoilers but the importance of families and friends shone through this book and I just really wanted to be part of this story. I cried at the acknowledgements too because I forgot that this book was wrote by Stephen Hawking and his daughter. I don't think that should put you off at all. (It was one of the reasons I was drawn to it.) I forgot about the importance of the partnership between father and child and I think this is reflected in the story pretty well.I am definitely reading the next one in this series because I think the Hawkings have stumbled on something wonderful.Such an underrated book."
18,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29182197-lena-strugaru,4,"Again the dilemma of rating a book for kids... As a scientist and a books-for-kids reader and lover I wouldn't give it more than three stars: although I appreciated the plot, the science therein and the introduction to the research world, the characters are a bit stereotypical and the book is too didactic for my taste. Overall I perceived it as a book written to teach (maybe this was its goal, although not exactly what I value in terms of books for kids) to the detriment of the story flow.However, this is also a 300-page book read in three days with my 5yo that made her think, ask lots and lots of questions, laugh, wonder&wander through Milky Way, all in all a book that nourished her passion for astronomy. She would probably give it five stars, but let's give it four (and keep 5* for Ender's Game :))).Next in line: George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt :)."
19,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350155-sarah,2,"Despite being a science teacher by profession, despite being a supporter of science, despite wanting to love this book, I did not. It was slow, painfully stereotypical in its characters (main scienctist = crooked glasses, ruffled hair, gangly, kind; bad scientist = mean, ugly, collection of students to do his bidding...), predictable, and had too much of an agenda. I painfully wanted to be able to skim the book to get to the ending to say I finished it, but instead I had to listen, and listen, and listen. So why did I? Because there were moments when I thought it could be redeemed; moments when I hoped it would be less didactical and more of a story. But, alas, it was not."
20,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70987579-royce-b,5,I thought this book was SCIENTIFICALLY AWESOME because it is all about science!!!!! The reading age would probably be 5th grade and up. There is a boy named George and he entered a science competition for a computer. Other books from the same author are George and the Big Bang and George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt. Will George win the computer? Read the end of the book to find out!!! 
21,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30201947-ahalya,5,"amazing read ! 6yr old kind of had to take a break but he quickly wanted to come back... well I read aloud this one . did not miss the fact sheets and it took longer than we usually take , totally worth the time though"
22,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"Nice try, but not good enough. The science isn't quite right, the plot is lame, the writing is awkward. And the introduction of fantastical elements is extremely off-putting. I don't think kids already interested in science will like it at all (for all those reasons) and those who are not interested will not become so (the science bits read too much like a textbook). The kids are cute though, as is Freddy. I liked that the bullies had personalities."
23,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87876559-antonia-ballauf,5,"Uhhh I really really liked that! I have been interested in astrophysics for quite a time now, but I was always so intimidated by these long and scientific books and most of the time, when I read these I didn’t understand 3/5 of it!But this book was such a good and simple introduction to the major theories and especially about my favourite topic: black holes!!!I’m really looking forward to read the other books!"
24,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112778293-jaydenkid,5,"Amazing. Written by Lucy Hawking and the great Stephen Hawking, this novel intrigues you to read on with its spectacular plot, surprising and disappointing you everywhere you go. Not only that, these authors were not here to entertain, they inserted some fun information on our universe every once in a while; they even had some photos of space!"
25,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75193543-lilo,5,I loved this! It sometimes comes off as a bit preachy but I can forgive that. Aside from that it's light-hearted and very informative. It's obviously a children's book but I think you can enjoy it at any age.
26,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40175257-christy,4,Audiobook with the kids. My 8 year old loved it. I enjoyed how much information it had. We'll definitely be reading the next couple books.
27,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64620109-windsprite,1,"The whole language of this book had a tone that gave me the impression of an author who isn't really taking children serious. It feels like only a story that is handed out to kids temporarily, to help them become adults as quick as possible. It is not speaking to the children as human beings, but to unfinished grown-ups. ""It's so hard to explain things to those incomplete adults and nailbitingly frustrating to write a book that suits them because you have to intentionally dumb down every thing!""Some of the themes were very ostentative in what it wanted to tell grown-up who read this book to their children, while I don't think this book really finds the language to tell what it wants to tell to children. The themes are set up kind of clumsy, so that serious grown-ups who read the news will definitely get what it's about, but seen from this point it was too ostentative for grown-ups and at the same time did not explain everything to the children, because it used words to name things, but not words that explain things. Passingly, it also tells messages that are a bit bothering.It tries to ridicule environmentalists who only vilify technology without seeing it's benefits, by showing how George is socially an outsider because of it and just how unpractical it is to live in the ways George and his family live, in an exaggerated way. George's parents are a much too unsubtle caricature of extreme environmentalist behaviour. It's hardly relatable because you don't actually see this often in real life. The supposed disadvantages the book points out about environmentalist life are mostly just childish as fuck. That he hasn't ever drunken ribena juice in his life -guess what? I'm not British, so I haven't either, despite watching TV all my life.So, overall they're life looks like this: George has a pig to care (never eat a pig) for instead of TV and they don't have a car and put on candles at night. Of course they're vegetarians and that's why they're food is always disgusting, because, juck, vegetables! ""Environmentalist diet includes Vegetables and green stuff! Sad!""Saying this as a kid who still doesn't eat Spinach and Brokkoli: Children's fiction should start taking on a differentiated view on greens! (Because if it did maybe I'd be enjoying a bowl of spinach and mashed potatoes just now and then)Anything Lucy Hawking writes about environmentalists is way too unsubtle and simplified and this is exactly where it doesn't take children seriously. Because environmentalism is NOT specifically about not having chocolate muffins and ribena juice. It is also NOT specifically about not having a computer (give me the name of an environmental organisation that doesn't have a Facebook page, Twitter account).And all the stupid little things she mentions are just not the main downside of environmentalism. All kinds of problem of environmentalism are rather of human nature (the way environmentals think about and behave towards other people) than of technical nature (that George hasn't ever drunken Ribena Juice). It's downside is from consequently vilifying technology as much as Lucy Hawking awkwardly tries to ridicule environmentalism.In the end, yes, environmentalists and scientists do start sitting together. However, it's not very satisfying and the situation isn't well carved out. The way they get there isn't even lightly carried throughout the book. Yes, Hawking does construct events that lead towards it -Georges science presentation, through which he wins his first own computer and that makes his father say: ""Okay boy, keep that computer, we're fine with it"". The book hadn't set it up well and when it happened, it wasn't very exciting. The whole book didn't seriously carry out pitting environmentalism and belief in technology against each other to finally find a synthesis in a way, that was really convincing and satisfying.The main characters are rather bland, especially the main villain. Even if a children's book can't use every word that exists to describe, this doesn't even feel like it's the boiled down version of complex humans seen through children's eyes, but like the author didn't even had something more complex in the back of her mind. Especially the main villain and the school bullies. They're just the cardboard cut-outs that appear in so many other bad children's novels.It's a mistake that Ms. Hawking tries to make an fantasy adventure plot out of this. It almost aims towards ""The Little Prince"" on the one hand, by blurring reality and at the same time trying to squeeze in lectures about black holes, except that it takes the black holes seriously and equal to what was just a moment ago something that is by all means of technology impossible. Even though they aren't there, this book reads like it was close to not only having explanation boxes about Outer Space, but also warning boxes everytimes something scientifically incorrect appears: ""Attention, this isn't real, it's just so we can have more fun with the story"". While at the same time, all those explanation boxes don't really fit into the narrative, they just pop up and I personally cared to read them, but they are super not seamless. And what's more important: you learn a lot of facts, but nothing about scientific thinking and how scientists came towards discovering them.Kids who grow up in countries where their education system is sufficient to give them a realistic outlook towards sciences (which for some people sadly isn't even the case in many Western countries) will most of the time see through this book and understand which parts are real and which aren't.However, that's this book's problem, because the fantasy parts are gadgety -something that does things for the fun of it as in ""imagine, if you could travel to space without NASA needing to spend loads of money on it"". But it doesn't understand the fictional reality as it's own reality.This book doesn't wait for solving the problems that first need to be solved before you travel to space (it does scratch on the destruction of the environment, but really just SCRATCH) and real problems and complexity don't exist, because environmentalism also seems to be the only problem in the world and gladly science can solve it. No, society and conflicts between human groups and the fact that we would carry all the problems we already have here to any other place we'd go before we even arrived there aren't even mentioned. Across the Universe and it's two sequels have more depth in going deeper into political action and it's consequences and downsides of science and space travel all exist.I'm talking about a YA trilogy which includes romantic conflict and is mostly retelling the colonization of America in space that has some bothering stuff (and just as the book I'm discussing right now, gadgety fictional science that doesn't do good to the consequences). Anybody tell me the bar was set too high.But the moment when Cosmos is actually used as a plot device is just BAD. (view spoiler)[You see, resurrecting a dead person by having a computer who is so super smart that the humans need not lift a finger is just lazy. While Cosmos in general is set up in the story, it still doesn't excuse that he resurrects Eric perfectly and both Eric's death and resurrection are meaningless, because the don't make up for any important message (Maybe, don't mess around with technology without a scientists oversight, but it isn't in any way built up, so it doesn't seem ) (hide spoiler)] Yes, I know it draws back to Stephen Hawking's black hole radiation, because according to the current laws of physics we know, information cannot be destroyed, thus and showing that somehow Lucy Hawking is actually trying to tell something about what her father tried to explain to her. Sure, cosmos does have his origins in physicists making assumptions though experiments, often things like ""assuming perfect vacuum"" and ""assuming zero gravity"" and things like that. But this is happening in a book a physical experiment, and this it can be assumed, that a lot of it isn't supposed toBut the same laws that tell us things cannot be created out of nothing or destroyed without the particles it was made of still existing (the amount of material and information in the universe remains the same, period) also mean, that to create something new, something existing needs to taken apart, so it can be put together in a different way (Even Harry Potter has ""Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration"", because J.K. Rowling learns out of her mistakes and came to understand that overpowered magic like time-turners busts world-building).Smartphones need resources, which cause wars in countries, where they exist, because we still haven't solved the neighbourhood strife in the global village.Even the information technology we use in everyday life is full of costs we just do not see. The reason, why Mark Zuckerberg needs to grab and sell our information to earn money to keep Facebook a ""free"" service, is in part to become rich, sure, but I it also started because servers need electricity from power plants to run them. And to pay for the electricity bill, you need to get money from SOMEWHERE. It's not a surprise, that Silicon Valley is so interested in Teslas and renewable energy.There would have been a huge price to create something as awesome and powerful like Cosmos. A cruel price, and it would be something that you do not see immediately, hidden in the fine print, just like Facebook. That he exists and that there were no economical costs to making him exist, is plain unbelievable. And he's a fictional element. (Pff, sure, he's the AI singularity. There you go. Problem solved, except that Cosmos is still hypothetic and even the ""AI singularity"" would probably have limits -they're just limits that we haven't reached yet). There's just a general hook to mixing science with a fantasy adventure. Fiction inevitably contains elements in it, that are symbolic -things, that are only stand-ins for something other than themselves. George's parents are supposed to be representative of environmentalists. But they're caricatures. Eric is supposed to represent science and scientists. The bad guy is there to represent scientists who are selfish, but he's mostly just selfish and one-dimensional. Nothing about how science is more often than not stripped of its power on society by being bound the economy that pays it.Cosmos is pure deus ex machina. An all powerful computer whose limits aren't really clear. But he's also a device in a fictional world and the consequences of Cosmos' existence and functioning are not clear and at the same time to technical and important within the world to not matter. As long as it's convenient to the story and what Lucy Hawking tries hard to tell. I am writing this as a person who loves fantasy and who is a Star Wars and Harry Potter fan: If you want to write science, think more about it, before you want to make a fairy story out of it.This book doesn't even manage to get across it's own message. It's a convoluted, unclear mess, because it doesn't exactly pinpoint what it wants to say. It does try to say, ""let's save the world with science"".It does try to say, ""let's use technology in a beneficial way.""And it tries to be nice to environmentalists.But it doesn't do that very well.No, of course we can't write a story where we use big words to explain children all of astrophysics and society at the same time. BUT we can teach children basic concepts that bring them closer to the concepts you are brushing over. And this book brushes too many sociopolitical things that go completely unexplained, because supposedly that's not the topic of this book while not being exceptionally interesting or better than text books in those parts that actually feature some science.How to do it better next time, Ms Hawking: Write a series about George's every day real life boring adventures. He wonders about how things like cars move, how rainbows have all colors, about his pig's behaviour and all kinds of every day stuff and in the course he learns basic concepts of physics. Maybe he starts asking questions about how. He would learn the concepts of science and the concepts of deducing information out of existing information. He could have all kinds of wrong ideas about the world that only gradually change.It's seemingly boring. But it's honest and is more likely to take the children a bit more serious, simply by the fact that it doesn't pretend to be very fun. It doesn't brush and topple and kinds of societal topics that aren't explained well in this book.It's not your fault, that your father is Stephen Hawking, thus boosting this book's sales and that probably the publisher made good use of that fact, right? That you accepted a science communications prize for such an unclear message as this book though... :-/I don't even blame most scientists for not understanding literature well (it's rather normal) but it does matter, because just because a book mentions how far the moon is away from the earth and that pluto isn't a planet anymore, it doesn't mean that this book. But, you're an author, Ms Hawking.Good children's books: It's actually the hardest thing in the world to write them.And yes, I expect children's books to at least do an attempt at explaining societal issues it touches.A good children's book is one that you will like so much as a kid that you will remember it as an adult, read it again as an adult and not feel as if you have been betrayed. Since I'm (kind of almost) an adult now, I think this book would have definitely betrayed me."

31,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292621-pop-bop,4,"As Advertised - Engaging Characters, Decent Plot, Real ScienceRemember the 1950's TV show ""Watch Mr. Wizard""? Kids visited Mr. Wizard in his home lab and he demonstrated various scientific principles and the science behind ordinary objects. It was great educational TV, it had millions of viewers and associated Mr. Wizard science clubs, it gave rise to the tag line ""Gee, Mr. Wizard!"", and it probably inspired the Professor Proton character so dear to Sheldon Cooper on ""The Big Bang Theory"". But, it would have made a blah book.The question for me here, notwithstanding the attraction of Stephen and Lucy Hawking's involvement in the project, was whether this book would work as both a substantial introduction to science topics and as a good fictional adventure. I'm happy to report that, at least for me, this book actually works on both levels.Our hero George has a bit of an edgy relationship to his parents' back-to-nature anti-tech lifestyle, which is an interesting element of the book. George is thrilled when his new neighbors turn out to be an equally edgy girl and her talky scientist Dr.Wizard dad. The book starts like a visit to the lab, but very soon adventure plot elements enter the picture, and before you know it we're involved with a super computer, space travel, black holes and an amazing range of issues related to physics and cosmology.This is complemented by a portfolio of color photo plates, sidebars, drawings and illustrations. Not too many to get in the way, but enough to add detail, color and interest. There's an acknowledgment at the end of the book of Christophe Galfard, a Hawking associate who vetted the science and made sure it was all current and intelligible, and that just shows the care that went in to making this, if not authoritative, at least correct from the science point of view.While some of the narrative can be a bit clunky, and some of the story choices are a bit idiosyncratic, (odd villain, some monologuing dialogue, a kind of ""Dr. Who"" random improv vibe), and parts of the plot require a fantasy instead of scientific tweak to work, the upshot is that this book works as a kid space adventure, it works as a kid buddy adventure, and it works as a tasty science and physics sampler. That's a great and entertaining accomplishment."
32,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I bought this for my kids, but they were both too old for it. I read it out of curiosity. Give it a solid 'Meh.' Yes, there are sciency text book pages in here, but by the end I was skipping them. Skipping them because I was not the target audience, and I was already familiar with most of it. Skipping them also because they were in no way necessary to the plot or story.The story was weak. Smart kid has unfufilling homelife, and gets picked on by bullies. Weird/great people move in next door and improve his life. I didn't see a resolution at the end though, and this being a kids book, resolution is important. The ""bad guy"" is still on the loose, and suffers no punishment. The gang of bullys likewise get no comeuppance. The kid's loving but luddite family is portrayed as stupid and ineffectual because of their distaste for technology, but that issue is never really explored. It's pretty clear from the plot that technology in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing. The sciency neighbors are pretty damn perfect - for the 1950's. Which brings me to my real problem - the utter sexism of this tale. The main character is a boy, who loves science and technology. Nothing wrong with that. The neighbor child is a girl who loves ballet. Nothing wrong with that. But the girl, she's portrayed as an extravagant attention grabbing liar. She also knows her science, but is constantly being chastised for breaking the rules. About halfway through the book the girl is shuttled off to 'granny's house.' and plays a minor role after that. Neither mother is a scientist. George's mother is a homemaker, and neighbor mom is a musician (we discover when she finally appears in the final chapters). Both seem to spend a lot of time doing traditional gender roles, cooking, caring for the elderly. If the intent of this book was imbue children with a fascination for science, I think it will fail miserably. The story is dull, with no resolution. And girls, you can always grow up to cook and clean for your science loving men. When the girl does make up fabulous tales, she's ridiculed for lying. I truly hope that Stephen Hawking did nothing more than allow his name to be used for a cut of the proceeds. Otherwise I will lump him in with Tim Hunt."
33,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10813317-steve-rogers,4,"When his pet pig disappears into his neighbor's garden, George stumbles into a house that has supposedly been abandoned for years. He soon discovers that there are in fact people living there called Eric and his daughter, Annie, who are both obsessed with science. George is unaware that this new friendship with these mysterious occupants will soon change his life forever, as he begins a journey that will take him across the universe and back again.Eric has a computer called Cosmos. Cosmos is the most powerful computer in the world that enables you to travel anywhere in the universe. When Eric gets sucked into a black hole and Cosmos gets stolen by a mad scientist who intends to control the universe, George must race to find a way to stop his evil plans and save his friend before time runs out. The story is action packed, fun and fast paced but what makes it unique is the contribution by Stephen Hawkins. Through pictures, photographs and concise fact file entries that run alongside George’s story, scientific information is presented in a way that is easy to understand and answers pertinent questions about our universe and our place in it. Using this book alongside science lessons and particularly space topic work would be very beneficial for children in KS2. Any child that is curious about the mysterious world that lies beyond our atmosphere will enjoy this book and want to discover more about the wonders of the universe."

Plainly, it is meant to clothe the miracle of physics into language that children can understand but the laws of physics themselves are blown off at almost every plot point.Then there's the part where a person gets sucked into a black hole but the super-computer speeds up time and sucks him back out again, putting him back together, particle by particle, messing up only his eyeglasses.I am not a physicist so I cannot speak to the accuracy of the science contained herein. There were a few typos but I read a first edition and assume those mistakes were corrected in subsequent releases.The story is engaging. The hero brave. The villain evil. The enormity of space well-described (and, thusly, the ridiculousness of just about everything I'll ever do in my little life reiterated which made the book, in a sense, a little too scary for an adult to read ;)I'll add to this review when my kid has read it. We'll see what he thinks."
35,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,3,"Yes, I know I put this book in two categories that should be mutually exclusive. Let me explain. This book was written by Stephen Hawking and his daughter Lucy. Their aim was to interest kids in science, so they wrote a fictional story but the science is completely accurate. Well, I'm not certain about Cosmos but the rest is apparently completely accurate. This is a book about George who has been raised by parents who don't trust technology and try to live without it. George doesm't appreciate that and would really like a computer. The parents are also into trying to save the world from Climate Change. The scientists that George gets to know through Eric debate whether to save this world or find another one to live on. George asks why not do both, rather than making a false choice? More could be written but I'm sure others have done so already. The value of this book lies in making science attractive to kids. I'm not sure this book would be a huge success but at least they tried. More scientists need to reach out to regular people and help them to understand science and the Climate Crisis. Good for Stephen Hawking and his daughter!"
36,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,3,"I probably only liked this book 2-stars worth, but Hugh Dancy's reading ups it by a star, because that, at least, was pretty great. At the beginning, I loved this. It had a real fairy-tail-like quality to it, and it actually seemed very smart and funny. Only once we got to Eric's house, things quickly deteriorated. For me, at least. I found the lecture aspects of the dialogue really irritating, and the whole idea of Cosmos, this magical computer that can send you into outer space, a little too cheesy and ridiculous. Things just seemed too over-the-top and trite at the same time (especially when it came to Greaper and Ringo and his gang and George's parents), and I found the vast majority of this book pretty tedious. I get what the Hawkings were trying to do here, and I can appreciate that, but I think it could have been done a lot better. Still, I am clearly long past the age for which this book was actually written (elementary school, I believe), and maybe as a kid it's excellent. As an adult though? Not so impressed. "
37,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545155-wanda,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book that I hope will inspire young readers interested in science and astronomy. The story is fairly simplistic, relying on overdone formats and basic stereotypes in pulp children's literature. I felt there was a mismatch between the story and the presented science information. Tthe plot is best suited to primary students with the science information more appropriate to the intermediate grades. The astronomy information is not integrated into the storyline but is presented as fact sheets throughout the book. Nevertheless, I will gladly add this book to the school library as it will inspire some students and make important connections between reading and science. Personally, I learned many new things about the cutting edge theories in astronomy and was captivated by the breathtaking, color photographs of space. Steven Hawking's lastest theory about black holes is a key premise in the plot."

This should be fun' Now I know a tiny tiny bit about planets and stars (The magic school bus was probably the first one to explain it in a way I understood when I was little and I took a cosmology class at uni and I didn't do so terribly wrong in it) Began reading the book and it was all very exciting until page 30ish....yeah not much fun, I mean yay for science I understand (even if it was written for primary school) but I thought it was a bit dull and hugely predictable, but I am sure geeky bf when he was little would've LOVE it (as he mention it) and I am sure there's kids around the world that will be introduced to science thanks to this book.

The story is a fun adventure that explores the vastness of space and explores our solar system along with the daily drama of middle school. I have mixed feelings about the portions of the book that were obviously contributed by Stephen. The facts were interesting and informative and helped the understanding of the universe. BUT the layout was a bit distracting. (Like those side bars and fact boxes in magazine articles, but this goes on for 300 pages.) While they were very informative and can help the reader understand a lot more about the universe, which helps identify with the activities and adventures of the characters, it broke up the flow of the story because it was inserted right in the middle of chapters.

Still love the photos, and it's doing a great job of exposing an advanced EFL student to science terminology in an interesting way.Aug 2009: Strangely enough this book or its plot was a bit too preachy and predictable. But at the same time I enjoyed it, and the photographs and facts, both in the story and supplemental, were great and make me want to keep it for myself. I'm planning on passing this on, though, to my nephew and niece - see what the kids think about it and hoping they'll also pick up on some of the great science and the sense of wonder at our great universe that does indeed pervade the story."

The villain is evil and the protagonists good, though that uber-computer Cosmos is a bit over-the-top. Color photos were nice, but the sidebars (on facts, planets and other relevant bits of information) definitely got in the way. They would have been better collected into an appendix or glossary that could be referred to when necessary. Read with daughter (11) and I felt it was a little below her level, both the science and the language. The one new concept from Stephen (information escaping black holes) required help from the uber-computer to fit the story, and felt clumsy. The associated sidebar was very incomplete, even for the age range (light can't escape but particles do?)."

The Lucy and Stephen Hawking duo sure knew what they were doing!

(Very minor ones)I'm not a science major, but I am a reader. And the thing is, as good as Stephen Hawking is a physicist, he's not so good an author.

Whatever reader you are, if you’re into science at all this book hits the spot. Told as a mix between a wrinkle in time, story thieves, land of stories, and all those space themed informational books in the world, this book is great. With the feeling of “plans destroyed by evil scientist” plot and the “boring life to amazing adventure” theme, this book tells the story of a boy named George. George comes from a family who doesn’t own any electronics whatsoever. George l’on a to own a computer. When he stumbles into his neighbor’s house after looking for his pig, he finds out that-unlike what he’s been told- there is no mysterious old man that lived here. Instead there seems to be a perfectly normal scientist with a daughter who does ballet. When the two of them show George how amazing science can be, and what lies in space, George is amazed. He finds out that they own the worlds most smart computer, Cosmos. Cosmos can draw things in mid air and talk like a human. Eric and Annie make him promise never to tell anyone about Cosmos. George goes to school the next day pondering with a new mind about how boring his life seemed now. His teacher, Dr. Reeper, catches him drawing pictures of space, and George accidentally lets out the secret of Cosmos. Dr. Reeper from them on treats him nicely, but really he’s forming a plan. He’s always wanted to find a new planet where humans can live to claim as his own. Eric has stopped him last time, so Dr. Reeper is on a mission to succeed again. And he will do anything for his goal. But George doesn’t know this yet. One day he and Annie, Eric’s daughter, decide to travel into space. George has now learned that Cosmos can actually open a door into space! When they come out, Eric is so angry at them for going off without telling him. He separates Annie and George from seeing each other. Meanwhile, Dr. Reeper sees the class bullies as an opportunity for his plan. Asking them to send a letter to the house he knows Eric lives in, he promises them money. One by one he asks them to carry out his deeds. All the while, George hasn’t told Eric that he let out the secret. He starts to become suspicious of Dr Reeper though. He heard his teacher talking to the bullies about some letter. Dr Reeper is saying that they couldn’t have delivered it, because Eric had t disappeared yet. When he goes to Eric’s house to warn him when Annie isn’t there, there is a scientist meeting going on. After the party George spots a letter on the floor. He gives to Eric, forgetting about his warning. Eric claims that this is the most important information and jumps into space. From there things unravel, and George tries to stop evil Dr. Reeper. When the science competition he’s been waiting for starts, George is over at Dr Reepers house, listening to him murmuring. George finally figures out his teachers plans. Dr Reeper is talking to the principal without seeing George, saying he couldn’t come to the competition. Then George has an idea that might just stop his teacher in his tracks. You’ll have to read to find out what happens and the dangers that lurk! What things might be lost, and what can George do to save the day? While you’re devouring each page, science slides come up every so often that explain what you’re reading. This book is full of surprises and turns, so wrap you’re head around the stars and prepare for the reading adventure of your life! "
60,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52482799-thomas,2,"Within pages I really liked the idea. Fiction meets non-fiction in very subtly style. The topic is the universe and Hawking is the name. But it's the fun-loving tone and the easy breezy writing that makes the combination work. George meets his wacky next-door neighbour with the most powerful computer in the world which is capable of literally taking people on voyages through the universe. The information is neatly and interestingly presented and the photographs provide a sense of galaxic wonder. Evil scientific nemesis is provided by a very typical children's book villian, the mean hearted teacher with an obvious name (Dr. Reeper).As a story, it's far from ambitious. It is a little like an extended Biff, Chip and Kipper adventure with the magic key being replaced by a super-computer. George, Eric, Annie and the computer are solid, fun characters - the bad guys are all simple cardboard cut outs. The Hawking's pair also have a less than subtle agenda, playing Eric the scientist against George's anti-technology environmentally friendly parents who don't even use candles. While at the start of the novel it seems a grossly biased argument, Lucy Hawking's does later try to redress the heavy-handed stereotyping by pointing out the need for balance in the modern world and exploring the use of technology in spreading information and educating others on the threats to our planet posed by technology itself. Her jaded bad guy vs. Eric represents, albeit very bluntly, those two opposing sides of science.Basically, Hawkings sets out with an idea and a purpose and she makes a very readable adventure yarn that kids fascinated by science and the universe will lap up. It's a shame it's not better - with some fine tuning it could be a much better, more compelling story. Motives, mistakes and emotions could be expanded upon (George's indiscretion on two occasions is left almost uncommented on) and in sharper hands the stories natural and entertaining humour could be honed into something much more entertaining. It could also be a platform for a more intelligent discussion on the issues surrounded the science at its core - the book is very simply told but if readers are able to digest and understand the brain-expanding space facts on offer here, they are also capable of comprehending a more complicated story and a depth in depth look at the problems and solutions science creates. To be a real success, the story itself needs to drag readers helplessly onwards and unfortunately it doesn't have that magnetism. 4"
61,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81750698-just-me,2,"I got this book from a teatcher. When I accepted to read it I was promiced a book about a boy who learns about space, black holes. The book was kind of like that but I didnt know that the book was written for 10 year olds. I thought I was to old to read Percy Jackson but those are nothing compared to this one. To be honest, I skipped a lot of the story after reading half the book and started to only read the facts, wich were good( some parts more evolved then others) I liked the pictures, I know that that sounds really childish and is really not proving a point that I was to old to read this book, but they were truely beautiful.If I were a parent I would have wanted to read this book with my child or at least recomend it to it. Deepending on what age she/he is and how mature he/she r, I would have recomended it to a 8-11 y/o child NOT a thirteen y/o going fourteen. It was really a childrens book. Also for me it was Hans and Greta and then a page from my kem textbook in sixth grade and than H&G and some more fact's, and also some cool photos and a lot of drawings of pigs. Im not saying the book was bad written because I truely belive that if I was into books in maybe second grade I would have liked the book. But I really hated reading books back then. I have been rambeling, but my point is that the main story is for children while some parts of the fact was even hard for me to understand if Im honest. Thats not a good mach I belive. So go ahead read this book with your children/ future children maybe your sibling or if you have a retarded friend. But if that person is over 11, just dont force them to read the main story. But the photos are lovely.:-)Ps I belive I will read one of Stephen's books that is not ment for children instead. "

I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it did defy my expectations in one key way and so that alone was enough for me to give it a 4/5. The thing that really stood out to me was the fact that it mixed flat-out fiction with a blend of science that should bring physics to life to little kids.In fact, you could almost split the book into two separate releases, but they do work well when combined together. The first of those is the non-fiction stuff, including the descriptions of each of the planets in the solar system and some information on their orbits, gravity and other attributes. The good thing about this is that it also includes some high-quality photography that helps to blow your mind with the sheer size and scale of space.The second aspect of this book is the fictional part, which follows the story of a boy called George who makes friends with someone whose father owns a supercomputer called Cosmos. The cool thing about Cosmos is that it can take George and the gang anywhere they want to in space, a bit like a cross between a computer and the Tardis. But there are people who want to take advantage of it, and George finds this out to his cost.Overall, there’s nothing necessarily revolutionary about this book, but it is decent enough – and it’s sure to put a small on your face, especially if you have kids who are into science. The illustrations are nicely done, too. They don’t feel like an afterthought, but rather like a vital part of the book. I’m glad that it’s a part of my collection."

The story uses lots of theory of black holes. That with our current technology we couldn't get anyone out of the black hole without being torn to pieces but if we had a powerful machine than we could take all the partials that came out of the black hole. If a human went in the machine would be able to put the person back together. I thought it was super cool.I really like George because he was funny. I still don't understand why he didn't know some of the times I knew. It felt like this parents didn't teach him anything. You can learn a lot on SPACE.COM.I didn't dislike anything. This was a great book because it mixed what I love with lots and lots of funny moments. Dislikes: NothingMy son doesn't like story like Harry Potty because it doesn't work in Logic and yet this story seem to work the way his brain works giving him a deeper understand and desires to learn about the Universe.He bought this book at a used book store after he finished his summer reading program we created at home.This is the perfect series for my son and we can't wait to buy more.Also my son can't wait to read A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking

If you follow me over on Instagram (@readingcolumn) you know I’ve been reading this super fun book at bedtime to my three daughters and they loved it! And this book is the gateway to getting my reluctant reader (who loves science and math) to start reading on her own without me hounding her to read. Win-win!George is a curious boy whose parents don’t believe in technology and want him to stay away from their science-y neighbours, Eric and his daughter Annie. When George’s pet pig Freddy wanders into Annie’s backyard his curiosity gets the best of him and he quickly finds himself in what appears at first glance an abandoned house but turns out is occupied by Annie, Eric and their super-computer Cosmos. Cosmos sends George, Annie and Eric into outer space to find a habitable planet but George’s evil teacher Dr. Reaper wants to steal Cosmos and use the super computer for his own sordid agenda.This book is fast-paced, fact-filled and includes lots of outer space graphics and fun facts. I highly recommend this book to any youngster who is curious about space exploration."
65,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105643480-asya-grove,3,"George's Secret Key to the universe is a children's: contemporary ""realistic"" fiction book written by the physicist Steven Hawking and his daughter Lucy hawking. It is appropriate and accessible to children six and up. The book follows the main character George who, along with his friends, is directed in an adventure from around the Cosmos by the world's most powerful computer, Cosmos. The benefit of this book is that it introduces children to concepts in physics that are much hardened to learn after a certain age. The book introduces atoms, stars, and even black holes with great pictures of some of our own solar systems celestial bodies such as the moon and mars. These are given with great facts that read largely like they were transcribed from passive voice. That is where the book struggles. The sections with the story become convoluted and are then immediately juxtaposed with factual elements making it very hard for children to tell which is what. The book, though, is undoubtedly better than nothing. And with the proper guidance of an adult to reinforce which concepts are real could be a valuable primer to children starting their stem education. For those reasons, this book gets three stars."
66,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6070009-richard,2,"So, this is the first one. We've read a couple of others, and really enjoyed them, but this was a bit of a let-down. I would advise reading it first, and then you know that things will only get better.What I noticed first was was when the science was wrong - surely impossible in such a book, but there were a couple of small things....However the mix of science with fantastical, non-science aspects, was a bit confusing. The children are on comet at one point, which seems to take a few minutes to fly past Saturn, but then get to Jupiter in about the same time. There were numerous other scenes which involved scientific impossibilities, which would be okay in a fantasy, but in a book presented not just as SF, but as serious science-based SF, those inconsistencies were annoying.My son and I liked the characters, but here's the thing - having pretend conflict, or where someone is not listening, because that adds dram or forwards the plot, is BAD WRITING. Authors - don'tr ever do it. Okay, this was the first one, so we'll let them off, and i must admit I did not see it in the other books we read, but it seriously pushed me close to book-hurling territory."
67,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82600095-abigail-rhee,3,"I liked reading the book George’s Secret Key to the Universe because it was a good story mixed in with a lot of science. Maybe it isn’t possible for a computer to make doorways into space but it is possible for computers to be programmed to have a mind of its own. Usually that’s a bad thing. The plot of having Mr. Reeper and Eric old friends was a bit typical. And Reeper being an old windbag and wanting Cosmos for himself is a completely normal, boring, and predictable outcome of working with something so powerful. The book was fun to read but the story wasn’t actually so enticing. The idea of intertwining science with something else is completely normal but why in this book did everything have to be so black and white? The earth was being destroyed by the people who lived on it! Who cares? We have to find a new planet to live on! Why and how in the world would you transport people to live there? Those are the questions people will get if they are too wrapped up in hypothesizes and in a world of their own."
68,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82597553-cl-de-rekla-zykrona,2,This book is okay. Not the best thing I've read. But the idea of Cosmos is pretty cool. I like the name Cosmos. Anyways George gets new neighbors but his parents warn him about them. Eric and his daughter Annie are scientists. George goes and meets them. They show him Cosmos the best and most incredible computer in the world. George and Annie go inside a portal and travels around in space for awhile. They almost get killed and Eric and George's father forbid Annie and George to play together. Gorge joins a science competition but his plans are halted because he is worried about what has just happened. Greeper has stolen Cosmos and Eric is stuck in a black hole. George saves Eric from the black hole than George goes to the science competition. He explains about Cosmos and Greeper is furious that Eric had escaped. Georges parents who used to be angry at him are now proud of him and his speech at the science fair.
69,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307955-shantai-ballard,3,"I am not a big fan of science even though I do nursing however, I did enjoy this book with my son who is into planets. What I enjoyed most about the book is that even though it is a nonfiction book it is written like an story. It has a few main characters, instead of just one. The main characters are Daisy, Terrance, George, Susan, Annie , Eric, Dr. Reeper, and Cosmos. Cosmos is a super computer, that can create portals into outer space and allow people to peer into space. Even though it is a story it is the most informative one I have ever read. This book explains every aspect of space that you can imagine starting from atoms and beyond. My son enjoyed this book and seeing his excitement made it all worth wild. I would recommend this book form second grade to fifth. "
70,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/317431-john-nondorf,3,"There's some great science [some fairly advanced having been co-written by Stephen Hawking!] in this book written in a manner that should be understandable for its intended audience. While all of the color photos are beautiful and informative, I found them distracting. Entire signatures of photo plates that are largely unrelated to the text sometimes fell between words in a single sentence (e.g. ""...peering down at George's notebook, which [8 pages of color plates of the Moon, Sun, stars, the Milky Way, and cosmic clouds] George hastily tried to cover."" I think kids would find this very distracting. The story itself is OK though some of the characterization feels off. Most notably, George's parents don't ring true as characters.Probably best suited to kids who are interested in space, but don't already know a lot, and can get through a 296 page book."
71,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8500257-elizabeth-ducie,4,"George lives with parents who abhor technology and are completely in to self-sufficiency and saving the planet. But he discovers a family living next door, scientists with a super-computer. Together they have adventures. But along the way, there is a huge amount of very difficult science made understandable for children. This is a brilliant book, well-written, a fun learning tool. Highly recommended for any child with an enquiring mind (which is to say, all children).Just a word of warning to the adults: I heard Lucy Hawking interviewed on the radio and she described the books as Harry Potter, but with science that really works. As a child-less HP fan, I bought a copy for myself. However, this really is a children's book and I found it a bit too simple for me. But as something to read to, or with, your kids, it really is wonderful."
72,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069939-molly-christensen,3,"Fun story to learn about the universe and what modern science thinks. However, I feel like a lot of the characters did things that weren't morally correct and got away with it, and George's parents were protrayed as really weird and awkward (which the book kind of made up for at the end, but it made you feel awkward earlier on in the book.) Also, it covers the big bang theory and how we are all children of stars since our universe was created from an explosion. I found this explanation interesting, and it opened up a good conversation with my kids since i was reading it aloud about how we believe in creation, not the big bang. I'd be hesitant to just hand this book over to my kids without having the discussions. "
73,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46813031-xander-konkel,4,"I liked the book because it taught me stuff about science - new stuff that I didn’t know. What I liked most about this book is it told science in a story. Normally, I don’t like science, but I liked this book. It covers everything from planets to moons, and even comets. It focuses mostly on the universe beyond, and there’s even a part on attempting to find a new, undiscovered planet. George and Eric are neighbors, and they both like science. Eric is a scientist that does research on the universe. George discovers Eric from when his pet pig (Yes, a pig) goes missing and it turns out, he ended up at Eric’s housing drinking grape soda that Eric’s daughter, Annie, offered to him. But that’s only just the beginning..."
74,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25507081-dmytro-bagaiev,4,"This book could seem boring and poorly written to adults, but children find it great. My daughter also found it great and after finishing this volume she now wants to read all the rest of the series. It weaves together everyday school life and fantastic adventures, involving simple descriptions of many phenomena characters meet on their way. This book would be a great introduction for children into what in fact science is, what it does and how it can describe literally everything around and solve problems of our living.I can recommend to all parents who want their children to learn about science in an easy and exciting way."
75,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52254869-apsar-ali,5,"Even though this book is for kids i loved this one, it's not only for kids it explains all the basic science info about planets , stars and black holes. Lucky are those kids reading this at their young age. Loved this one, and the story is also pleasant till the end. A joyfull ride with k owledge of universe. I wish to have a COSMOS with me :-) diving furthur to other series of these books. The way he explains Black hole with waterfalls is super and easy to grasp the actual comcept. While travelling to the outer space george , eric and annie takes the readers also with them to explore the beauty of universe . Thank you Stephen hawking sir ... The world of science misses you a lot."
76,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17062276-nichole-smith,4,"Read this with Thatcher. I recommend it for any kid who has a deep interest in the workings of the universe. It’s a fictional account of a kid who gets to travel to outer space by way of a super cool portal. The story itself was perfect for an 8-year-old listener. Not sure if an 8-year-old could get through it independently, but my son had no problem comprehending it as I read it to him. It does a great job of weaving nonfictional information into the storyline. And then every chapter or so has a glossy page that has pictures and informational text that goes into more depth on the things being discussed in the storyline. "
77,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128047-starr,4,"I picked this up because I was interested in possibly using this as a part of our homeschool reads. I was interested but I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. It was fun, it made science and the solar system exciting. All of the very big complicated topics were broken down and easy enough for someone with no background knowledge to enjoy and understand. The trips into space were fun, especially since there was an element of real danger. I am looking forward to continuing this series. "
78,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29140617-jeff-stephenson,5,"Quite simply, this is an awesome book. As a middle school World Geography teacher, I HIGHLY recommend this book to all my students, and I try to be much more like George than his teacher Dr. Reeper. The book explores the universe in a unique and fascinating way. Only by truly understanding our world, and it’s place in the universe, can we ever hope to protect and care for it. This book helps make that knowledge accessible to almost all readers. Five stars is not enough-I rate this book as billions and billions of stars!"

My 10-year-old daughter and I read it together. It was a fun way to learn some facts about space and the main characters were delightful. My daughter was intrigued by Cosmos and the thought of a portal to space, especially in contrast to Commander Kelly’s graphic details of space flight. She wrote her own review here: https://www.facebook.com/170851487613..."
80,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36264060-leni-iversen,3,"Read this with my 8 year old. The story telling was a bit silly, but had a nice message overall. My kid rolled his eyes at the ignorance of the characters and the impossibly of the plot, but it made a nice light frame for the science fact boxes, which didn't underestimate children's ability to take in details and numbers. It also led to some questions that I couldn't answer, so I guess now I'll google what happens when two black holes collide/grow into each other. Do they merge? Does the bigger one swallow up the smaller? Inquiring minds want to know."

I was super into everything related to space at the time and I loved science. However, I found my classes always a bit too dry and kind of boring but this was exactly what my pre-teen self needed to fall in love with science again.I don't know what this book would be like from an adults perspective but this is definitely a book for children to get them engaged and interested in sciences while also reading a cute little story."
83,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71582539-logan,4,"I read this book because my brother said it was good. He was right -if you like science and space. The point of the book is that a super smart scientist wanted to explain science and space ideas so that kids could understand so he did it in the form of a story about two kids, their parent and a super computer. It is funny to read but a little silly. For younger kids it might not seem silly. It is really full of a lot of science information and I love science so that was cool. "
84,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2625435-nikki,4,"At the end, my 6 yr old asked if we could buy this book. I think she might give it 5 stars! :)The story of George and how two different worlds collide is interesting. And also the struggle between what you grew up with vs accepting new ideas. I really enjoyed the little bits of facts scattered through the story and also the pages of extra info from time to time. Honestly, I was a little disappointed that the mischievous pig didn't play a bigger role!"

Immensely readable, it has a lot of factual information which science teachers in particular use to stimulate children and expand their learning experiences. Whilst there are a few scientific facts that need some clarification it will promote discussion. Stimulating. Highly recommended."

I don’t think this book was very well written and the character development fizzled. While taking notes on each chapter several times I wrote Eric instead of George and George as Eric. The one neat thing was the colorful pictures that can give the reader a clear vision of space and their journeys through the portal as a good visualization tool. Overall it was just okay. Students who are interested in space will take to this.
87,1416954627,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3702669-laura,3,"The authors describe this book as “science fact” as opposed to science fiction. I give the factual information four stars, and the story itself two stars. The factual information is interesting and clear enough for children to understand. The story is rather hokey and didactic. The characters seem cartoonish (especially Dr. Reeper) and their dialogue feels flat and cliched. This story would probably entertain younger readers, but my fifth graders found it unrealistic and lacking in suspense. "

The story line is very engaging for students because it is easy to follow and there is a clear protagonist and antagonist. The characters are also easy to relate to for 10-12 year olds.
