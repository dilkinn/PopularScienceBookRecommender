0,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217948-fleegan,5,"I thought that this book was going to be like Super-size Me only in book form. Not that the author would eat McDonalds everyday but that he would talk mostly about the unhealthiness of fast food. I was wrong.The author barely touches the ""fast food is full of fat and fattiness"" deal. He mainly talks about the greed, power, and evilness of fast food companies. I would read this book in the mornings as i drank my coffee and I would get so mad at how only a few people can make so many people miserable. I would cry at the working conditions of the meat industry (and trust me, i'm not crying over the cows. it's the workers that have it so bad that i just want to take them all away from that horrible job and give them all sacks of money and comfortable chairs to sit on.) He discusses the ranchers, the feedlots, the slaughter houses, and the packaging companies. He talks about the potato farms. He talks about minimum wage. He talks about how our government is supposed to regulate and keep us safe from unhealthy meat and that it not only doesn't do that, but CAN'T do that, legally. The USDA cannot recall meat that is unhealthy. It has no rights to do that. The meat companies can voluntarily recall meat, but they can't be forced to, even if the meat is infected with epidemic proportions of e. coli 0157:H7, which, as far as i can tell, is like ebola, it turns your organs into mush.The meat industry is so corrupt and has bought so many republican congressmen that it has no watchdogs, no police. OSHA is not allowed to investigate a factory unless the injury records show above the national average. The meat companies hire doctors to lie about the severity of injuries and, and, and they keep two injury logs. the real one and the one they turn in to OSHA. This is illegal. And when the companies are caught they have to pay a piddly fine. The FDA doesn't care about the food you eat. They only care about prescription drugs.The USDA is not allowed to police the thing it was set up to police. (This is not new and it's also the reason i don't drink milk.) The author also says that the government will not change any of this. That the only way to make some change is if McDonalds will make the change. So if enough people complain and make bad press about McDonalds using nasty beef instead of clean, grass-fed cows...nothing will change. He discusses the franchise/franchisee relationships. He discusses the hisory of fast food and the american west. It's amazing. This book was so interesting. If I were to become a vegetarian it would not be because I had a problem with the way cows are treated. Nay, it would be because of the treatment of humans. "
1,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249420-jeff,4,"""As God as my witness, I shall never eat another hamburger as long as I shall live!"" That's what I said after reading this book. Then the phone rang. It was my friend who wanted to go grab a quick bite at Wendy's. I had a cheeseburger. I never looked back baby!It's not that this book paints the fast food industry in a wicked horrible light. It doesn't become a witch hunt, this isn't ""Hey, you know, Elie Wiesel is right, Nazi's are real sons of bitches!"" (which is what I expect most people think after reading Night. I've never read it myself... I just expect people think that after reading said book... though to be honest, most people probably think that already, unless you're Mahmoud Ahmadinejad), but it's not all puppys and flowers either. Really, it's rich old white men looking out for themselves (and who else are they going to look out for?)It's been a few years since I've read the book, so I could be wrong about this, but I'm going to say this book isn't even as harsh on the fast food industry as Supersize Me (A film which I refuse to see, because: Duh! Eat nothing but fast food for a month and you're going to get sick? Who was shocked by this movie? ""No, but you don't get it... it's how sick he was, and how fast."" That's usually the opposing argument I get. I still say ""Duh!"" I'm going to make a movie where I shoot up heroin three times a day for a month, or smoke seven packs of cigarettes a day for a month, or hit myself in the head with a hammer five times a day for a month, and see what happens. I really want people to say, ""Man, I knew that hitting yourself in the head with a hammer was dangerous, but who knew how dangerous it could be. I mean he was brain damaged by the second day! I'm never hitting myself in the head with a hammer again!"" But I digress, this isn't about film... this is about books).It's a pretty good book for the history lesson on how fast food got started, and how the industry has done a good job screwing everyone from farmers, to fat kids, to illegal migrant workers, to small business owners, to who knows who else. And just when you start to think, ""Man, screw fast food..."" the author himself says he still eats fast food... then you think, ""I sure do like them McDonalds fries."" Then you hear about the newest Halo 3 tie in at Burger King, where not only will your fries be wrapped in a Halo 3 themed package, but your soda will come in a Halo 3 cup!?!?"" So what, so what if the meat might be tainted with the fingers of an illegal, or so what if the farmer who sold the slaughtered cow can barely aford new boots, dammit, I want it my way, and I want it my way now! Plus there is this one part of the book that talks about how some fast food companies will donate money to schools in exchange for advertising space or a spot in the cafeteria... and let's be honest, what would you rather have fat smart kids, or fat dumb kids? (Smart thin kids isn't an option- this is public school we're talking about here).It's a light romp through the dark underbelly of the fast food world. It'll learn you but good, and it certainly gave me pause, right before I went out and got a #4 supersized with a Dr. Pepper (cause Dr. Pepper rulz)."
2,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233375-bookshop,2,"I could easily give this book a 5 for its well-researched and informative content, its engaging pacing, its excellent mix of dry facts and gossipy tone. I literally couldn't put the book down since I picked it up from my sister's bookshelf.I started reading with high hopes. I heard so much about the book and how it changes people's perception on fast food. I do not eat a lot of fast food but I enjoy my occasional burgers from Burger King, crave Chicken McNuggets from time to time and adore KFC with heaps of fries, rice and ketchup. The book begins with the history of McDonalds which encompasses not only the corporate history but also the history of fast food and its supporting industries. So far so good. As I proceed, I find it hard to accept its two major themes: big corporations are the big bad wolf who feast on little people and the king of the pack is McDonalds.Although the author writes that he doesn't say McDonald and the fast food corporations are the roots of all American problems, he essentially implies so throughout the book. That is not fair. The reason for finger pointing to McDonald and some unknown Carl Jr and Jack in the Box is not apparent in the book. Brand-wise, I wonder how KFC fare in all these debacle although tacobell, owned by the same company, gets an honorary mention. Consumerism-wise, what about those insatiable American appetites?Another strong message is that the big corporations sell cheap food, by taking advantage of suppliers and their poor, illiterate workers, not from the goodness of their hearts but for humongous profits. Fair enough. But he goes on to argue that the marketing tactics employed, though necessary, are unethical. I am not comfortable with this statement. Since when have we all lost our cognitive power and freedom of choice? When an advertisement says that drinking insecticide is good for us, won't our instinct warn us otherwise? If the kids insist on eating McDonald to collect the latest figurine from Nemo, where are the parents with conscience who will firmly tell them no when a no is warranted? I have no problem with presenting selected facts to support a theory or argument. But I have problem with authors who do not explore or conveniently neglect the other side of the equation. One particularly disturbing fact-massaging is his argument that fast food restaurants are favourite crime targets and the crimes are mostly inside jobs. On the same page, he mentions that fast food industries have high labour turnover and can afford only to hire people with questionable background. Now, is it chicken first? Or egg?The author offers obvious solutions in the epilogue. One of the most irritating ones is proposing that free-roaming cattle rearing is the way to go. He conveniently avoids these questions: How can he reconcile the math of vast overhead to maintain the land, huge labour cost (we want our workers to be paid and insured well), and small customer base (transporting meat to all over the country is bad!) with affordable prices? Aren't these organic, grass-fed beef normally sold in chic upscale supermarkets? Is he suggesting no-child policy to curb the population and to make way for those healthy, happy cows? The book doesn't stop me from anything. Prior to reading, I already know that these fried foods are not good for my health and moderation is key to all my eating activities. I enjoy reading the book but feel misled by its content. The problem with the fast food nation is not the cheap end-product at high social cost but the lack of common sense and excessive gluttony of its consumers. I remember someone who wrote an email full of expletive because, after reading this book, he felt McDonalds caused his children's addiction to the Happy Meals. Now I understand why he, like countless fans, was so readily bought: the book's theme is David vs. Goliath, its tone straight from tabloids, its information tasty morsels from the dark side of an otherwise wholesome industry. The book provides ammunition for people who prefer to absolve personal responsibilities. In short, this book is served the way people like it, regardless of its content."
3,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Written on May 29, 2012:I am glad that I had a large Pizza and a KFC burger at the Delhi airport before I started this book. Adios fatty fries, triple-decker domes and cheesy discs, you will be missed. Ignorance is indeed bliss sometimes.Update: June 22, 2014I am happy to report that I have largely stuck to this. Ever since reading this I have virtually avoided this sort of trash and must have eaten a maximum of a couple of burgers and pizzas in the last two years (and that too most reluctantly, when unavoidable). Thanks, Schlosser."
4,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763271-nancy,5,"Fast Food Nation is a fascinating and very readable book. In some ways it reminds me of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. It's not only a critique of fast food, the chemicals we are ingesting and the health problems we are facing, it is also critical of a system that allows exploitation of young, old and immigrant workers, and of the suburban sprawl that resulted from the eradication of efficient and environmentally friendly public transportation by the auto industry. The author focuses his criticism on the states of California and Colorado when in reality the same strip malls with the same chain stores and miles of fast-food clusters and suburban sprawl exist all over the US. I have always been particular about what I eat and rarely visit fast-food restaurants, so this book has not changed my eating habits drastically. It has, however, made me a wiser consumer."
5,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Oh, America. When will you wise up?In 1998, the seed of Fast Food Nation appeared in Rolling Stone Magazine. Schlosser's expose has since been expanded to a book and then a movie, and still international love affair with fast food continues. The latest edition also contains an afterword addressing 'mad cow disease,' or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In it, Schlosser accomplishes the almost Herculean task of weaving together the birth of the fast food industry, the growing connection with car and highway culture, the growth of kid-targeted marketing (McDonalds and Disney were early leaders), the developing connection between the industrialization of our food and family farmers (particularly chicken, potato and beef), the anti-union connection and the development of the engineered food product. I liked it more than I thought it would; expecting a didactic cardboard entree, I was provided with a seven-course meal.He shows true journalistic roots by beginning sections with a human-interest angle, from the beginning with Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.) and Richard McDonald, to the potato kingpin J.R. Simplot, to a Colorado rancher fighting to protect his ranch against enroaching suburbs, to a union representative fighting for safer conditions in slaughterhouses. If there was any weakness in the book, it would be the challenge in bridging the stories from the individual to the larger philosophical and systemic issue. I understand the human face helps a reader create meaning, but for me it occasionally felt contrived, particularly in the international settings.For me, there was an especially powerful moment of revelation when Schlosser points out the drawback of dealing with corporations, not local owners:""The nation's meatpacking firms, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be far less committed to remaining in a particular community. They have successfully pitted one economically depressed region against another, using the threat of plant closures and the promise of future investment to obtain lucrative government subsidies. No longer locally owned, they feel no allegiance to any one place."" Doesn't that just about sums up the state of industry in the U.S.? The only times a corporation can't cut and run is when it depends on a highly skilled workforce. It's one reason the ""create jobs"" political platforms make me a little crazy.I found myself wishing this was required reading. It's not that I'm opposed to fast food; I'm opposed to a lack of informed choice. Full disclosure should include understanding some important points from Fast Food Nation:1) Flavor experts are utilized to create the optimal taste combination that hits our salty-fat-sweet spot. Thus chicken pieces contain an average of 30 different ingredients, of which salt has been added in at least three different steps and an artificial strawberry shake contains over 28 ingredients (http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnut...)2) the industry has been key in fighting against food regulation and testing, even when known outbreaks of E.coli in school lunches have killed children 3) the burger is sourced from cattle feedlots, where 75% of the pre-cooked meat contained microbes normally found in fecal material4) companies specifically target children so that they can manipulate their parents into taking them against parents' better judgement5) potatoes and chicken come from marginalized farmers who are basically one step up from indentured workers, buying raw ingredients from the company and selling the 'grown' product back to them, and insulating the company against risks such as weather, crop failure or disease6) companies target teens and non-English speakers as workers because they are less liable to demand 'rights' or 'living wages,' and still the company gets a tax break for 'training' 7) absolutely, positively, there is no way to eat healthily at McDonald's with the exception of: a side salad (no dressing), fruit and yogurt parfait (5.2 oz), grilled premium chicken classic sandwich, apple slices and egg whites. (http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnut...) You may be healthy in spite of the food, but not because of the food.Again, not saying I condone the choice--I have my once-a-year Shamrock shake, and an intermittent fry craving, proving just how great childhood marketing is and the lure of salty-sweet carb goodness. Less than 5 stars is because for me, the journalistic style over-reached, especially on the section on the German McDonald's, both in Eastern Germany and the one near Dachau as well as Gorbechev speaking at a Las Vegas convention of franchise owners. But overall, it was an excellent book, entertaining and insightful. Reading it gave voice to my intuitive feeling that there is something rotten in the system.

6,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,4,"This, I feel, is now a classic book in the 'wrongs going on in the food-making world'. Although this is from 2001, I feel many of the revelations are still true, unfortunately. It is US-centric, yet at least some of the facts appear worldwide, depending sometimes on the country. But it did make me feel wary about eating fast food if I was traveling in US.This book of 3 years of research talks about the industry of fast food, and its consequences on people, animals, and nature. There are notes and a bibliography at the end, and two afterwords. The city of Colorado Springs, and some other places near it, are the example-centers for many stories within.This is not a story merely of dangers within food, and on treatment of animals, but also on people suffering because of it. Some of the people are given here as examples of this, and one is left with great sadness after reading their fate. I will now go on to list the chapters. The book is divided in two: first part talk mostly about the business and people behind the counter, the second part focuses on food and global business.(view spoiler)[ 1. Beginnings: history of many fast food companies, including the influence of car culture, and looks of each place 2. Getting to the kids: Disney's involvement, advertising, the toys... 3. The staff: in US often teens - part-time, unskilled, low-pay; causing dropping out of school sometimes; the stricts rules, unpaid overworking, lack of unions, violence in the workplace 4. Being a franchisee (incl. history, rules): success not guaranteed, conflicts with the franchiser (Subway esp. bad)- 5. Potatoes = french fries: how it is done, how farmers suffer (esp. smaller), where the good taste comes from: 'natural flavor' (not necessarily healthier than the beef tallow used before). Here we find the often-quoted ingredients list for stuff in strawberry milkshake - long and hair-rising). 6. Cattle business: here we find ranchers suffering just like the potato farmers above, small plots merging into bigger ones. Similar is also going on with poultry growers. Some ranchers commit suicide, like the example of Hank here. 7. Meatpacking industry: workers often (illegal-sometimes) immigrants, often illiterate and unaware of any rights; high turnover rate (usual lasting time 3 months); creating poverty-and-crime/drug-ridden areas around; the smell from feedlots (the shit); history: from urban to rural, away from unions. 8. Health risks of workers in said industry: from 'knife cut scars' to 'DEATH'; the working conditions are dangerous, especially because of the speed demanded; many accidents go unreported (and injury reviews are often falsified); abusive supervisors, especially for women who get verbal/sexual abuse also from male workers; especially bad for sanitation crew who work with chroline-mixed, hot water: poor visibility, heath, hit with water by other workers, falling risks, etc. Later the author tells us that while the places he reported about were bad, it was *worse* in Texas. 9. Contaminated food (you might refrain from eating when you read this chapter): the e.coli, salmonella, listeria. The meatpacking systems' lax food safety pratices does not help. What bad can be introduced in the meat besides those mentioned: many, but especially SHIT. Children being vulnerable also through school food (which gets cheap meats). Feedlot issues: worn-out dairy cattle, all the shit around, what they eat (other animals, incl. cats and dogs). The industry goes for denial, inspection-avoiding, recall-avoiding/hiding. The meat also can end up in the home freezers. 10. Fast food globally: rise of obesity, less use of traditional food, agricultural production imports, advertisement for kids, spying on protesters. Global conquest especially post-Cold War, causing protests.  Epilogue 1: Different ways of raising beef; Conway's Red Top (closed in 2012) and In-N-Out (still going strong); what good influence can come from McDonald's power; what even the ordinary consumer can do. Epilogue 2 (added after first prints): on Mad Cow: from feeding other animals to cows (same sort of feeding happens in other places - poultry, hogs, pets, zoo animals). Reaction to the problem: not addressed well at first. This shows that contaminated food appears in other countries too; although US has avoided serious Mad Cow stuff, who know what will happen? Also addresses reaction to the first prints of the book. (hide spoiler)]The ending of the book shows the authors' optimistic views about the future of fast food industry; it might be different now. But anyway, this book did make me think, even if some points vary by country. I have some trust in my country's meat industry so that doesn't worry me here. Still, it did raise my awareness of workers' rights, what cautions I might use while traveling, and of favoring more my country own burger chains, I guess *lol*This is a classic book, one that makes you think, one that might make you lose your appetite for a second, and maybe make you grateful for some things that you don't have (bad working conditions, ill health). It seemed first a bit frightening to read this, but I was glad in the end for the experience. Well worth it."
7,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121852-emily,3,"Wowwwww.By the time you finish reading this book, you will strongly consider becoming either a vegan or a hard-core local eater, or both. I took a tiny bit of comfort in knowing that I eat vegan about half the days in the year; still, the book really scared me. It's hard, factual journalism with a huge section of footnotes in the back. As much as I'd love to dispute some of Schlosser's claims, I look around me and see evidence to support what he says about the amount of cheap food we eat and what it's doing to us.Contrary to popular opinion, this is not a book that vilifies fast food. Chains like In-N-Out Burger are extolled for using fresh, safe meat and peeling their own potatoes. Nor does it vilify carnivores. The gist of the book is that, in our relentless demand for a cheaper, more efficient system, we have neglected the human element of each phase of food preparation, from farm to plate. Something has gone horribly wrong.The author avoids what could be a smug, glib attitude in favor of an urgent, prodding tone: it is clear he believes we are in a crisis, and he is probably right. It's hard to go back to your favorite restaurant and order a hamburger after reading ""What's in the Meat,"" or to complain about work after finishing ""The Most Dangerous Job."" Serious stuff.I do think Schlosser comes down way too hard on conservatives in the book, and he admits in the epilogue that to be fair, many liberals are guilty of the same sins. For instance, the Clinton family has close ties to the poultry industry in much the same was as the Bush family does to the beef industry (which is the primary subject of his research.)Finally, I applaud his conclusion, which is a very pragmatist (and even capitalist) approach: in a free market, we vote in dollars spent. If, through our purchases, we demand safer meat, fresher produce, and fair pay for food service industry workers, we will get what we want. It's a simple matter of doing research before we buy, of supporting small farms who do things the old, slow, respectful way.Well, I'd say ""enjoy"" . . . but I read it too! I gave it three stars only because I couldn't justify saying I ""loved it"" when it consistently made me want to skip dinner. But I'm glad I read it. You should read it too.Kyrie eleison!"
8,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/935150-george-bradford,4,"Another title for this entertaining book could have been ""Our disposable society: How our utter disrespect for our selves, each other and our environment created the world we live in today."" The automobile's destructive force on American life was been well documented in other works. But Schlosser extends that work specifically as it relates to the food industry. Not just fast food. But the entire food industry. And it's scary stuff.Bottom line: we're killing our selves. Yes, fast food is bad for you. But its not just the crap they serve at the chains. The influence of fast food is so pervasive that it effects all aspects of our nation's food supply. And it does so adversely. Our nation's food supply is now a full blown public health crises. Food poisoning is epidemic. Food supply recalls from corporate farms, meat plants and canneries are a weekly occurrence. Each episode worse than the previous.Schlosser doesn't offer solutions. He sounds the alarm. "
9,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58889295-kimber,3,"Schlosser takes us on a crash course in American history, and it all starts with McDonalds. At the same time that Ray Kroc was envisioning how McDonalds could change the world (and make him rich), Eisenhower was overseeing the construction of the superhighway system. Almost immediately, fast food restaurants began mushrooming on the edges of freeway entrances, and America was never the same. Fast food isn't just unhealthy, its destroying our culture. Instead of looking around at our beautiful environment, we see mostly urban sprawl: gigantic neon signs, and cookie-cutter subdivisions. Not only does this loss of beauty affect our souls, our standard of living has gone down. Gone are many good jobs. Meatcutter jobs that were part of the middle classes are now mainly occupied by illegal immigrants who are so desperate they will risk losing their fingers (or their lives) in these dangerous, difficult jobs. And what has happened to the livelihood of farmers is a national shame. Being that this book is 20 years old, there is reason for optimism. Slow food has become a movement. Organic foods are sold in every grocery store. But we still have to make the choice. The choice of what world we wish to live in. The temptations to stop for fast food are still there. But improvements that Schlosser was dreaming of are happening, more and more. I recommend this book because these gory details and tragic histories could freeze into our brains and be a fit reminder to bypass these common and convenient foods and begin to make changes in our lives. The history of these companies is important to know. They cared about keeping their pockets lined, at the expense of their workers. At the expense of peoples lives."
10,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38579677-corinne,5,"ExcellentThe last sentence of the book (that I appreciate a lot) : 'Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic'."
11,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,4,"McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and more...they all have the friendly, bright exterior, with the fast, cheap, addictive food. But behind the bright colors, the mascots, and the friendly clerk smile is a whole different world of fast food. Eric Schlosser peels back that wrapper to show the real world of fast food - big corporations using people and people's ignorance to rise in power, drive out the little guy, and make more and more money for themselves. Oh, yeah, and the food is gross too.I think by this point most people have heard of this book or the ""Super Size Me"" movie or many of the other pieces that have swarmed the media mind in the past decade. (Yes, decade. God, I feel old.) That was what drove me to buy this book years ago - that, and it was used.This year has been the year of non-fiction reads for me. Finally, almost five years after graduating college, I can read non-fiction again without tensing up and going into melt-down mode. One of the many non-fiction topics that has interested me is the fast food industry and the America meal. That is why I took this book off my shelf and finally read it.I didn't really expect to learn much that was new. I had read the news articles about how bad fast food is for you. I saw ""Super Size Me"" and the McDonald's hamburger and fries that looked good after weeks of sitting out on a counter exposed to the elements. And I've experienced first hand the affects of fast food - how it makes you gain weight, become lethargic, etc. So I figured this book would be pretty much more of the same.If you open this book expecting only to hear about how bad and unhealthy the fast food itself is, you will be surprised to find out that is only a small portion of what Schlosser focuses on. Sure, he does bring up the quality of food (SPOILERS: It's gross), but he focuses a lot more on other areas: how these seemingly cheery companies treat their workers, their competitors, and the food industry itself.One of the images that stays with me is the life of a worker in a slaughterhouse - not because of seeing a cow gutted (though, admittedly, that sounds absolutely disgusting). But how these companies drive their employees like draft horses. Pushing through 40+ cattle an hour. Forcing employees to lie about injuries. Refusing to pay worker's comp. Letting employees work in terrible conditions, exposed to dangerous chemicals and gases. Not training the employees enough to do the job well. And then paying these employees the absolute lowest amount they can get away with.All the while, these companies tightly grasp the curtain and shout to the government, ""Nothing to see here! Everything's all good!"" Even as employee after employee dies in a tragic, mostly preventable manner. Even as meat is exposed to dangerous diseases (E.Coli anyone?). You want to know what one company got fined after several people died of hydrogen sulfide poisoning? $480 PER PERSON. For a company making billions in profits per year?! That's absolutely ridiculous!!There were moments that I found rather dry and pointless. The prologue introduces us to a military compound in Colorado to make us imagine how future explorers may find fast food wrappers in caves and wonder what these weird people from the 1990's are like. And that's pretty much the entire point of bringing up this base in intricate detail. A lot of time is spent detailing the background of Colorado's growth, key fast food giant's backstories, and more. And while a good portion of it does make sense (learning about Ray Kroc or Carl Karcher's background IS important to the ""narrative""), sometimes it got long-winded and meandering.The other ""problem"" with this book is how dated it already is. This book was written in 2001, with an updated forward in 2002. A lot has happened in the 10 years since this book was written. A lot of fast food companies aren't doing the ""Super Size Me"" thing anymore. McDonald's has included apples and milk to its Happy Meal menu; most of the fast food companies have hurriedly added coffee drinks to their menus to draw new customers. And that doesn't include how most menus have a lot more salad and chicken options (Okay, so they aren't all that healthy, but it's certainly better than it was before!). I personally would love to see a ""sequel"" that explores some of the changes that the fast food industry has been forced to make and how much farther they have to go.A lot has changed in the world since the Mad Cow Disease and E.Coli outbreaks scared many people into reconsidering their food choices. This book lead the forefront into bringing awareness and change. And for that reason, this book has an important place in our history. Even if you think you know what this book says, I recommend picking it up and checking it out. You may learn a thing or two."
12,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/184384-linda,2,"I heard such great things about this book, but I have to say that I really had a hard time digesting it. Sorry, that pun was intended. It had so much gloom and doom and I really lost interest. Plus, I felt like I already knew more than half of the gross-out, oppressive factoids it spewed at me. The only part I enjoyed was when it talked about In-N-Out Burger and what a great employer they are and that John 3:16 is printed on the bottom of the cups. When I went to an In-N-Out and the clerk handed me my cup, I immediately flipped it over and saw the John 3:16 and then showed my two friends. The worker behind the counter asked what I was looking at and I showed him. When he said that he had no idea that those words were under the cups, it made me happy to know that In-N-Out wasn't forcing their religious beliefs down their workers' throats. Mmmm... For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only a juicy In-N-Out burger. Amen!"
13,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124789-trevor,3,"There are some shady rhetorical techniques used in this book. I particularly mean the chapter that begins with the little boy who dies after eating at a fast food restaurant. At the chapter's opening is a picture of the boy. It's sad. Then the chapter tells the story. Schlosser builds up a load of pathos to prove his point that fast food is so awful it kills children. Then, in a cursory statement, Schlosser divulges that the boy had other problems and died of a cause unrelated to the food he ate. What?! The book is loaded with these kinds of flaws. Which is sad because I think the thesis is important. That food is awful. And the situation must change. I taught a research and writing class with this book, and most of my students were at first appalled by Schlosser's finding. Then, after we analyzed his rhetorical techniques, they were appalled by Schlosser. In the end, no student took Schlosser's thesis seriously. We didn't exactly throw a fast food party, but I think everyone would have eaten the food had we done it. That does not mean the book has no value. It explains the fascinating history of the fast food industry. That, in itself, got this book three stars on my ratings."

At night the entire town smells bad. I could relate to this book because I lived in Greeley and I can relate to this book because I am not fond of fast food. The book talks about the start of burger joints and how they grew to be such an influence in today's society. The author discusses the life of workers and the working conditions in the meat packing plants. This interests me as I believe all workers of any vocation should be entitled to a safe and healthy working environment. I also learned about In and Out burger joint. I have never seen In and Out Burger here in Colorado. I was very impressed. In and Out Burger purchases meat from local farmers. They also pay their employees better than the popular burger joint.I enjoyed taking the tour with the author into the food industry's practices. I knew a lot about the meat industry before reading this book and I learned even more about what constitutes ""natural flavors."" The book made me want to read ""The Jungle"" by Sinclair. The book was informative. I might have a biased reason for liking this book as it was validation to why I didn't eat meat anyway. I live in Boulder County now so what can I say? Damn Hippies. "

I'd heard about it and expected a start-to-finish diatribe against the fast food nation industry from top to bottom, but that wasn't the case. Schlosser's approach is more soft-touch than ham-fist, which is good, because I prefer my medicine to go down easy, not taste like acid. "

Mainly because the last 44% of the book (I read it on my Kindle) is taken up entirely by an enormous bibliography, photograph credits section and an incredibly in-depth index.I wasn't sad; by the 56% mark I'd had enough, to be honest. I'm not saying it's a bad book by any means but it's not the kind of book one enjoys.The book held few surprises for me, I'm sad to say. I already knew at least 50% of the information contained in it and another 40% I could have guessed, based on my knowledge of how big business works. Perhaps I'm just too cynical to be shocked by this stuff or perhaps I've just accepted the fact that large companies will do absolutely anything they think they can get away with to increase their profit margins as a basic fact of life in the twenty first century.'What about the other 10%?' I hear the more attentive mathematicians amongst you cry! Well, the only part of this book I did find a bit shocking was the section that dealt with some of the horrific injuries suffered by employees in meat packing factories in the US. Injuries and deaths, I should say. Bone-chilling stuff, particularly the part about the meat packing employee who fell into a vat and was rendered into lard. Bad as that is, it's not the worst part (no sausage jokes, please); the lard was then SOLD AND EATEN!Ghhaarrrccckkkk!!!Anyway, I'm not dwelling on that any longer than absolutely necessary... Let's just say that this is an informative book that everybody should read... probably... It might give you nightmares, though; don't say I didn't warn you! This being said, you probably won't get the desired effect from the book unless you're considerably less cynical than I am...Right! That's that review written! Now... Burger King or KFC for dinner tonight? Decisions, decisions..."

As with so many aspects of American life, Schlosser deftly examines how humans are studied and then manipulated into following our drives, both conscious and subconscious, and how those that profit from learning about our behavior, continue to do so. In reading this book, people will see food, production of food and the marketing and selling of food, in a new light. "
19,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624672-tk421,4,"So I was eating a Big Mac at a McDonald's in the town where I was going to college, while reading this book, when a woman walked over to me and asked me what I was reading. I showed her the cover of the book. She asked me what it was about. I said it was about fat people in a fat nation. She was horrified with my response. (Let me tell you that I played football in college, and I've always had a few extra pounds on me: 5'10"" 240lbs.; I was strong-side linebacker.) Anyways, she went on to ask why I would be reading this book in a McDonald's. I really didn't have an answer to her question; it just happened to be the one I grabbed before walking over for a burger. I should have asked her why she was so unsettled that I was reading this book while enjoying a Big Mac and chocolate shake, but I didn't. I shrugged and said it was a good book and she went away. That was almost ten years ago; I've modified my eating habits. I guess as you get older the old metabolism decides to stop working at full capacity. I had all but forgotten about this book until I read a review of one of my GR friends, Nancy. After I read her review, I was reminded of how much I really like the book. Yes, it is sensationalistic journalism at its finest, but it does make some good points. And even with all the scare tactics thrown in the book for good measure, the book does raise awareness to exactly what we are putting in our bodies when we decide to eat fast food, and how the animals are treated before being slaughtered for our consumption. (On a side note, there happens to be a section about meatpacking plants, and the one in the town I grew up in is mentioned by name. Hurrah Midwest!!) Read the book. But make sure that you know just what exactly is be spotlighted. Like any piece of investigative journalism, the reader has a responsibility to think about the facts after being exposed to them. Man, I'm kinda hungry. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "

21,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4911921-jen-from-quebec-0,4,This book opened my eyes and scared the shit out of me. Just the description of how meat is produced in slaughterhouses was enough to make me quiver and question our entire 'food system'. This book answers questions that you didn't even know you needed to be asking. The glut of (disturbing) information is easily digestible (see what I did there?) and the knowledge contained here is important for *everyone* to know in our modern era of 'so called food' and 'nutrition'. -Jen from Quebec :0)
22,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"There was this flash of memory about this book as I stood in line to buy a pizza of late. With the tight social distancing protocols in place, the outlet was deserted and the energy of the place was subdued. The teenager taking my order (as is the norm) told me about the offers for the day and then typed away at the keyboard. While he was getting the order ready was when a lot of things from this book sprang to my mind. Eric Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation could most easily be called a book long argument against fast food chains. While he trains his guns against the major American chain restaurants : McDonald’s (specifically)and KFC (peripherally), the topic he tackles almost extensively is the Americanization of the fast food industry. It is not just the chains that he gives a critical view of but also what goes on behind the scene including meatpacking, manual labour, aesthetics of the food items too. The homogenization of this industry is achieved through a chain of activities almost all of which are highly exploitative in nature. It is these acts of exploitation that really make the case against fast food stronger. Schlosser calls out the below : Advertising : The core consumers for fast food remain children and focused advertising campaigns are now the norm for the industry. In the decades since this book, advertising has become for subtle and yet incredibly intelligent in the way it entrenches the idea of fast food into the psyche of children. With the way the internet has now become a necessity, focused ads have now become more personalized. Schlosser talks about how this is an area that is extensively researched and was ruthlessly exploited for monetary gain. This is a bizarre way of catching them young whereby a whole generation of children become addicted to fast food and thereby to health risks.Labor : The section on labor exploitation covers almost 65% of the overall narrative of the book and that makes sense since these chains thrive on a cheap and unskilled labor force. For a big chunk of teenagers the fast food chain is a spring board into finding their career options later in life but they are literally squeezed dry for the time that they work with these outlets. To unearth the bigger problem areas, Schlosser widens the scope of his investigation and looks not only at the outlets but also at almost all the associated aspects of what powers a fast food restaurant. The meatpacking and french fry industries rely heavily on an illegal immigrant population to keep their systems going is something that Schlosser uncovers. Being a very dangerous type of work, the conditions on the job are next to unbearable as it treats employees like a replaceable asset. A few of the case studies that Schlosser calls out are heart wrenching examples of how individuals who are past their healthy phase of being able to work are discarded unceremoniously. Food Hygiene :  One thing that I have always liked about the chain fast food restaurants is how quickly they can turn around an order. Personally I am a to-go person when it comes to fast food and this happens only when I am travelling. Having said this though, the descriptions of how some of the food items are prepared and what the dish could probably include was enough to make me gag. Since this is a US-centric book, it also calls out some of the worst food related illnesses that fast food has been a cause for in the US. What really pricked my conscience was in understanding how vehemently the chains and their suppliers denied any form of accountability and went great lengths to do so. I shall look at burgers warily for a while now !The author really has an axe to grind against the Republicans and never fails to hide that. The GOP gets the second best flak in the book and that did make me question the unbiased nature of the narrative. In the afterword, Schlosser clarifies this and also calls out some of the transgressions from the Democrats too. That makes it only slightly even ! Recommended. It is a very incisive work that helps you understood what goes on behind the counter in fast food chain restaurant. "
23,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426137-nurul,3,"I started reading this book after having lunch at a fast food restaurant....Have you ever been bored of cooking, would like to get away from stressful problem, trying to find a place where you can eat while your children can play, or trying to find a fast testable tasteful food? …..I grew up in a country where rice is the staple food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My first acquaintance with fast food was in mid 80’s. School and work have brought me to different culture and different countries which forced me to survive to various tastes and culinary culture. But this first touch of fast food has sometimes become a ‘get-away’ path for me.After long hours of studying (or dance practice), I still remember of having late supper at “three letters” fast food restaurant down at College Station Road, Athens (GA) with friends. Years after that during Eid, some friends and I were having dinner again at this ‘three letters’ restaurant in Newcastle, UK., because we were too busy and couldn’t find time to have a proper Eid meals. I also recalled couple of visits in this restaurant chain in Menado or Kendari after long weeks of hiking and staying in remote places of Talaud or Buton. This book was not just about the food, but the whole industry related to fast food, the franchise, the packaging, the workers and their welfare, and the lethal E.coli !!!. Ouch! How lucky I was surviving from the possibility of facing the impact of this industry, at least to my health. Trend is like virus, very contagious. I am wondering if we’re having the similar problems in my country. Malls are everywhere, face-to-face. When one food vendor becomes popular, everyone wants to be in the first queue of tasting it and the others build similar types of stores or sell similar types of food. The use of borax in meatballs or tofu has drawn our attention to be more careful in selecting or buying our food.Indonesian meals particularly home-made meals are still my preference these days. It is healthier but is time consuming to prepare especially like me who put the same seriousness in cooking as in studying. One thing I could not avoid, the potato products… Chips and fries… sigh!"
24,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,4,"That this book, unlike its spiritual ancestor The Jungle, has failed to kindle any noticeable change in public policy towards the production of meat in America is a grim reminder that today's meatpacking villains are even more vile, and have much more powerful friends, than Sinclair's. Just like Sinclair's novel, this book has also failed to spark even the tiniest bit of rebellion against the inherent injustice of industrial capitalism. I can't say you should read it because it will probably just fill you with bland liberal outrage, but it's a very good primer on the myriad ways in which a fundamentally amoral system allowed to run wild has devastated the physical health and economic well-being of countless Americans. In that sense, it dovetails very nicely with No Logo, and can be read as a detailed case study of Klein's thesis as it applies to the fast food industry."
25,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30173-andrew,4,"I expected this story to be the written version of Supersize Me, but it is actually much more comprehensive. Schlosser provdes a pretty in-depth history of the development of the cattlle, poultry, and potato industries and also fast-food chains. Schlosser has his moments of leftist, Republican-bashing arguments, but for the most part he tells a balanced story. The meatpacking industry comes off looking very malicious, but surprisingly Schlosser is somewhat light on his criticism fast food chains. He does not talk extensively on the obesity epidemic that is fueled by Big Fast Food. I think the pertinent themes that resonate in this book are:1) The drive for smaller government is far less benign than it sounds. Regulation of industries is an undertaking that only governments (and not individuals or self-policing businesses) are equipped to do. When governments are regulating effectively, OSHA is able to ensure safe work environments, small businesses are able to stay competitive thanks to anti-trust regulations, and food products are relatively uncontaminated. When budgets get slashed, all the above (and also apparently the financial markets) are compromised.2) Some will argue that the ends justify the means and that our food is as cheap as it is only because of the objectionable practices of the meat and fast food corporations. Schlosser argues that in fact fast food chains like In-And-Out and other companies making organic products provide decently priced foods without squeezing workers to death or being lacksadaisical with safety. A point is also made that cheap food should not be our blind end goal.3) Turnover and low skill sounds bad for employers, but in the meatpacking and fast food industries, quick turnover and low-skilled workers are ideal in order to prevent having to provide benefits and also to prevent successful unionization. The writing style was very smooth and easy to fly through. All in all, this is an exemplary work of investigative reporting that will hopefully one day be regarded similarly to Upton Sinclair's The Jungle."

Oh it's just so good, you'll want to slash your wrists. Or, depending on your personality and how you direct your rage, throw a brick through the window of the nearest McDonalds. Then climb through the broken window, retrieve the brick, and hurl it through an adjacent window. And then, when you run out of windows and realize your first instinct was a pretty good one, grab some of the broken glass and just go ahead and slash your wrists anyway. Because, really: what's the fucking point? If we live in a society in which our very sustenance is based on this horrific shit, why bother?It's hard to fathom the mentality of people who live lives of hedonistic luxury at the top of the enormous mountain of greasy deep-fried suffering they cause. I'm not even talking about the animals, who obviously fare far worse than the slaughterhouse workers themselves. But those workers, as Schlosser illustrates with enough detail to make Uptain Sinclair ask him to maybe tone it down a little, are three times more likely to die on the job than a police officer, and many many times more likely to have a limb inadvertently turned into the precursor for some unsuspecting kid's happy meal. How do people sleep at night knowing their wealth is built upon such textbook examples of man's inhumanity to man, let alone his inhumanity (or inbovinity) to cow?Earth's human headcount recently crossed the 7 billion mark, and this exploding population is a primary incentive for the wholesale mechanization of our food machine, the ruthless efficiency of production, discarding any and all concerns but quantity and profit. So really, go ahead and read this, and maybe lay off the Prozac first, just to see if you can handle it without reaching for the relief offered by that jagged piece of glass.

It goes in depth into the history of the industry and taps into the emotional human side of things by outlining the little guys who started it all with high hopes and lots of determination.The one story that I can't seem to get out of my head is that of the illegal immigrant who went to work at a slaughterhouse in order to make a better life for his family. After giving his all to the company including charred lungs, a broken back that never healed correctly and countless other broken bones and horrifying health ailments he continued to support the company because he believed in them. His commitment left him with a completely broken and useless body and he was then fired when he had nothing left to give. But the greedy, heartless wusses couldn't even dredge up the nerve to tell him personally. He realized he was no longer an employee when they stopped cashing his health insurance checks and he called to inquire as to the reason. Awful, just awful that this kind of thing is allowed to happen. The afterward goes into detail about Mad Cow disease in relation to the fast food industry. I already know way too much about BSE as it's a minor obsession of mine but I'm very glad he included the updated information in this version for those unaware of the ongoing problem. Agri-industry still has a firm hold on how animals are cared for and are still practicing dangerous feeding habits that endanger not only the animals (the ""food"" animals and our pets) but the future well being of our society. I haven't eaten beef since reading Mad Cowboy and this book. Read the book and make up your own mind. I doubt you'll come away from it unaffected."

His catchy, clever tagline makes you laugh: Do you want LIES with that?And lies he delivers.He claims the book is non-partisan, un-biased, with just the facts, and then says that if it WERE biased, (which it's not), it would point out that Democrats are good (only 2 mentions, both positive--including the one on the Clinton Administration. [I don't know anyone that doesn't have at least one complaint, even if it is about the former President's inability ot keep his trousers in place. But I digress]) and Republicans--along with business, money, profit, and omnivores--are evil (14 mentions, and not a positive one among them).The other huge lie (besides his blatant statistic-twisting) is that this book is about Fast Food. This book is about the horrors of meatpacking, the horrors of capitalism, managers who hire at-risk youth (I still don't get that one), potatoes (So. Much. About. Potatoes.), Disneyland, and the people who started the industry (the only viable subject out of all of these). What promises to be exciting (by the title and tagline) turns into something that is alarmist to the core, and yet as dry as a stale sesame seed bun.I did not read this book for fun. No one reads this book for fun. This is a supposed 'reference' book, but good luck finding anything worthwhile to 'reference'. The Hastings I bought (ugh) it at shelved it almost correctly--'Political'.

An analysis of just what fast food, especially fast food consumed day in, day out, day after day, year after year, can do to your body. I was wrong. Schlosser does touch briefly on how a sustained diet of fast food can make you ill by pumping concentrated doses of fats, sugars, and highly processed, chemical-heavy junk into your system, but that’s only a very minor part of what this book covers. He begins with what seems a nostalgic trip down memory lane: a history of the ‘founding fathers’ of the fast food industry, how men like the McDonald brothers, Ray Kroc, and Carl Karcher, and others, riding on the back of the booming automobile industry, set up restaurants to cater to people on the move. Food cooked factory-style assembly line, self service, drive throughs. Uniformity, low prices, no cutlery needed. So far so good: interesting, informative, but not scary. It gets scary the deeper Schlosser goes into what makes the fast food industry so bad for pretty much everybody except the big wigs in the industry. One section at a time, Schlosser examines the fast food industry from different angles. The young and minimally trained employees who work behind the counters. The children to whom this food and drink is marketed ruthlessly, using a ‘cradle to grave’ approach. The franchisees. The suppliers, in particular those who supply the potatoes and process them into fries, and the slaughterhouses that process the beef and chicken that go into most burger-and-fries orders. The chemists and scientists who create the flavour cocktails that make your shake or your chicken patty or your fries taste the way they do—always.He looks into how the fast food industry has become the face of the globalisation (or, perhaps more specifically, Americanization) of the world. And how there could be an alternative, how the same burger-and-fries meal could be clean, safe, and ethically produced. Fast Food Nation was an eye-opener for me. Some (a very little) of what Schlosser mentioned, I already knew of. A lot was new and horrifying. The sheer lack of ethics, the callousness and greed that guide the most inhuman behaviour on the part of the fast food industry and those who supply it took my breath away. There were facts here, too, that I hadn’t even thought about (for instance, that fast food stores, often full of cash and staffed mostly by teenagers, are easy targets for robberies). The conditions in slaughterhouses and meatpackers’ factories. What cattle are really fed. If you are a frequent customer of McDonald’s and the like, this book might help you think differently. Not just about how your burger can kill you, but also how it’s possibly killed, debilitated, or otherwise negatively impacted many people in its journey to you. A must-read. "
38,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214033-amanda,4,"This book was an incredible eye-opener for me. The book can be a little difficult to wade through because of all the facts and figures, but it is well worth it. I recommend the audio book version if you prefer not to read all the numbers. What I really loved about this book was that it wasn't just a laundry-list of the reasons fast-food is bad for your health. The book discusses the impacts of the fast food industry from every point of view: how it's changed American culture, how it's driven small family-owned restaurants out of business, how animals suffer before becoming your lunch, how workers at the meat packing plants all the way up to the restaurants themselves are exploited, and how fast food chains are the perfect conduit to transmit all sorts of food-borne illnesses quickly and efficiently across the nation. It was a true eye-opener for me. Even if you are happily a meat-eater and don't consider yourself an animal-rights activist or ""health-nut"", you should take the time to read this book. It will give you food for thought."

Love your burger?, big fries?, large coke? all served in 2 minutes and tasting the same world over? How did it all happen? Well Eric Schlosser lays it all out starting with the birth of fast food, the first drive thru, and the first McDonalds. And the industry evolved to serve it to us. You'll feel what it's like at the giant meatpacking lines, the huge potato factories, and with the soft drink syrup sellers. Henry Ford started the assembly line and the fast food industry applied it to food with teenagers manning the stations with low wages, no benefits, and E. coli lurking everywhere. Hold on to your sesame seed buns for a ride through the darkest side of our fast food world. The typical American eats 3 hamburgers a week? - you won't after listening to this book. "

I mean, I went into it figuring I would learn something but I was NOT expecting it to be so entertaining and have so many facts and anecdotes that were literally jaw-dropping. There's a good amount of history in the book which I wasn't expecting but found really interesting. Fast Food Nation is hugely informative and eye opening and I truly truly recommend it to everyone."

42,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,4,"Intellectual synchronicity: I recently listened to a Marketplace report on education, economics, and an interview with  Kelly and Zach Weinersmith on augmented reality (although that latter part could have been in a Freakonomics podcast), coincidentally shortly on the heels of finishing Fast Food Nation. Each source resonated strongly with Trevor's synopsis of Global Auction, which conveniently popped up in my email inbox around the same time.In reviewing the dilemma of higher-ed economics (ever-rising tuition costs, ever-lowering degree utility and value, etc.) Trevor points out that ""the whole point of capitalism is to find ways to drive down costs and to simplify work processes to the point of banality for the vast majority of workers."" In that vein, I would consider the recent augmented reality enhanced construction helmet referenced in the  Soonish author talk as an example of productivity-accelerating/expertise-displacing new technology. The helmet makes use of graphic how-to overlays to give the worker realtime communication intended to reduce error, minimize injury, and thereby speed the construction process. Now Schlosser's book has this whole chapter on how the industry custom-built some idiot proof kitchen technology, initially to ensure consistency of its output from one location to the next, but ultimately because doing so resulted in a fabulous side-effect, namely, that it enabled franchisees to eschew training costs in favor of a disposable, and in many cases [English-]illiterate workforce... in turn keeping labor costs low and deterring unionization. In effect, by moving the kitchen expertise from the staff to the equipment, McDonald's and their fast food fellows could reduce the workforce to meat robots. While the Weinersmiths weren't asked to make the connection with fast-food industry kitchen automation in the interview, I think the implications of the technology to the need for a skilled workforce are clear. The more repetitive and consistent the tasks/problems, the easier it is and more sense it makes to replace people with algorithms to address them. Look, you could use nanorobots to collect nectar and mass-produce honey on an industrial scale, but why would you? Bees are an existing, inexpensive, renewable resource. What's the point at which that becomes true of people? And what becomes of education, then?This is a practical concern for me right now as my kids are rapidly approaching college age. What's the best use of our collective investment of time, effort, and money to safeguard them from obsolescence? How much should go toward whatever constitutes practical expertise and how much toward signifiers of class and networking to cheat (er... fully participate) in the system? If Schlosser's work offers any indication, we might start off by steering clear of the fast food industry and those businesses with which it is in vertical alignment. Line workers are overworked, underpaid, and untrained. Managers frequently find themselves in the line of fire of armed robberies. Franchise owners are exploited by greedy, unscrupulous franchisors seeking to milk the most money from each territory. Suppliers scrape for the microprofit residuals of repeated bidding wars and requirements contracts, and their sad sack workers struggle as much for survival as for survival wages -- especially in the slaughterhouse and meat packing industries, whose dysfunctional, unhygienic workplace abuses have barely changed since  the Jungle days of Upton Sinclair. Add to all this the uglification of America contributed by the fast food industry's contributions to the negative feedback loops of urban sprawl, widespread obesity, and rampant, cookie-cutter, consumerist culture, and well… obvious efficiencies aside, left unchecked, highly industrialized, assembly-line practices rarely present a pretty picture.On the other hand, they have resulted in a darned tasty french fry. The secret? Beef fat flavoring. (Originally, beef fat itself, but the imperatives of market outreach to vegetarians and Hindus lead to more indirect approaches.) The peek inside flavor biochemistry makes a fascinating rest stop along the highway of enterprising depravity the author travels. Schlosser's book is mostly journalistic dynamite, with only thin slices of nonsense. Cherry-picking one exception to his otherwise even-handed text, chew on Schlosser's introduction to the wondrous workings of Willy Wonka's laboratories (author's metaphor, not mine): The New Jersey Turnpike runs through the heart of the flavor industry, an industrial corridor dotted with refineries and chemical plants…. The [International Flavors & Fragrances] plant in Dayton[, NJ] is a huge pale blue building with a modern office complex attached to the front. It sits in an industrial park, not far from a BASF plastics factory, a Jolly French Toast factory, and a plant that manufactures Liz Claiborne cosmetics. Dozens of tractor-trailers were parked at the IFF loading dock the afternoon I visited, and a thin cloud of steam floated from the chimney. (pages 120-1)While settings are important to a narrative, this description appears to me to be an attempt at guilt by association, an irrelevancy fallacy. For example, I'm a big fan of the work done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, notwithstanding that their campus sits just down the road from a shooting range in an industrial park across the street from a strip mall packed with seedy eateries and a dry cleaners.I consider myself a futurist, a person right at home with the idea that -- as the author is quick to observe -- technology is neutral. The innovation that feeds delicious, ready-to-eat burgers to time- and cash-strapped college students can, but need not also bleed corruption. The author offers a solid 30+ pages of ways forward toward a cleaner, healthier, humane and pathogen-purified product, the entirety worthy of serious consideration (heck, the implementation of only a few helped take down an e-coli outbreak). Schlosser's epilogue alone is a must read for its optimistic, constructive, and practical suggestions to curb the darker aspects and influences of fast food industry and culture. Taking into account the fact that this book has been in print for a full generation, I would not be surprised to learn that some of these reforms are by now well under way. Yet until I can be certain of that, I'll think it best to steer the kids away from all the scary clowns."

44,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane,5,"Where I got the book: purchased on Kindle.I’ve pretty much given up fast food over the years, with a very sharp decline in visits to such restaurants in about the last three years. This was due to my chronic gastric problems and the gradual realization that they were linked to preservatives and additives in food—fast food doesn’t sit well with the moves I’ve been making toward eating quality, preferably organic, food. Discovering that American bread was one of the culprits in my case also made it difficult to eat hamburgers, and since I’ve now been told by my holistic doctor that I need to avoid grains and dairy altogether, I’m pretty much done.And a good thing, too. Because after reading Fast Food Nation, I don’t think I’ll ever eat a fast food hamburger again. Schlosser’s book is as much about the cultural and economic effects of fast food as about the food itself, but the long chapter on food poisoning (introduced into the beef chain by the conditions under which the animals are kept (which also raises many ethical issues) is pretty much enough to turn you vegetarian. Schlosser describes the development of the fast food industry from the growing popularity of hot dog carts in the newly mobile California of the 1930s and 1940s, through drive-in restaurants, to the moment in 1948 when the McDonald brothers decided to eliminate carhops and silverware and sell hamburgers created on an assembly-line basis, giving working-class families their first shot at affordable restaurant food. The beginnings of the world’s largest restaurant chains were, it seems, marvels of innovation and inventiveness, and over the next 40 years entrepreneurs applied the new ways of thinking to other easy-to-eat foods such as pizzas and fried chicken. One of the great innovations was marketing these products to children, who would then carry their love for these trusted brands into adulthood. I feel like I should cue the Jaws music here, because we all know where this is going—supersized people sipping from 40oz buckets of flavored, diluted corn syrup as they waddle around Wal-Mart . . . .Schlosser goes on from his recounting of what, after all, were some pretty amazing examples of how to grow a business to get into what fast food has done for American industry. Among other things, it’s consolidated food processing to the point where most of our meat comes from a very few processing plants, created a huge workforce of mostly teenaged employees, resisted unionization so effectively that most employees barely earn enough to eat (and resort to robbing their own workplaces to supplement their income) and industrialized the production of food to the point where we’re eating a frightening combination of low-quality carbohydrates and proteins masked in chemical flavors. What’s more, this commercialization of eating is supported by public money—and has driven the traditional kind of farmer off the land.And then things get truly gross. Schlosser describes conditions in meat processing plants (one of the things I learned was that while chickens, that can be grown to uniform size, are processed by machine, cattle have to be slaughtered and butchered by hand by people up to their ankles in blood and shit) that raised the hair on my head. These jobs, mostly held by immigrants (not all legal) are some of the most dangerous you’ll ever read about, and cleaning up the plant at night is just as risky as swinging a knife by day as the cattle rattle by at speeds of up to 400 per hour. Having shown how the meat is processed, he then goes on to describe what happens when you eat a hamburger with shit in it as a result of these processing methods, and that’s the point, dear reader, where you might toss your cookies. I have a strong stomach, but that chapter was hard to take.And finally, Schlosser describes how America’s fast food corporations are exporting all of the above issues, including obesity, to countries around the world. Fortunately, the world does appear to be a bit more resistant to American corporations than are Americans themselves, and there are stories of triumph.This book was published in 2001, so the examples tend to be from the 90s—but Schlosser notes in his recent afterword that not much has changed since. He does, however, cover some stories of hope—the growing interest in quality, organic, locally-sourced food and particularly in combating childhood obesity is providing farmers who resist the corporate lure with a way to survive. But I think we all know that the corporate greed that’s at the root of everything Schlosser describes is still there, and that Americans, en masse, don’t seem to be able to resist buying food that they know is bad for them. That’s a pretty dangerous combination."
45,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela,4,"""Non à MacMerde""I’ve always indignantly asked whoever cared to listen how come America, the all powerful America, that banished smoking and prohibited alcohol in the name of public health, does not seem to see the close relationship between obesity (the second cause of mortality in the USA) and fast food and lets fast food industry flourish. I’d already guessed the reason, but after reading Schlosser’s book I know for sure. And so will you, if you’re interested in the subject, for there is a lot of accurate information of how the fast food chains and the meat industry gained their power and controlled the market until they became a symbol of modern American civilization, to be envied and followed by other nations: Simply eating at a McDonald's in Beijing seems to elevate a person's social status. The idea that you are what you eat has been enthusiastically promoted for years by Den Fujita, the eccentric billionaire who brought McDonald's to Japan three decades ago. ""If we eat McDonald's hamburgers and potatoes for a thousand years,"" Fujita once promised his countrymen, ""we will become taller, our skin will become white, and our hair will be blonde.""Like the huge epidemics in the past, fast food chains are continually spreading, killing people all around the world, for obesity is an illness as fatal as any other incurable disease:In China, the proportion of overweight teenagers has roughly tripled in the past decade. In Japan, eating hamburgers and French fries has not made people any blonder, though it has made them fatter. Overweight people were once a rarity in Japan.Moreover, often fast food is contaminated with E-coli or Salmonella, since the process of meat preparation resembles nowadays to a factory assembly line where speed is more important than hygiene. I never liked hamburgers, but after reading what I after learnt to be probably the most quoted line in the book…There is shit in the meat…nobody will ever convince me to taste one again. There are many disturbing facts in “Fast Food Nation”, like improper conditions of working in slaughterhouses and meatpacking companies, the savage exploitation of illegal immigrants and / or almost illiterate workers, the pressure of politicians who create or block laws to defend their own interest in the industry, the alarming lack of protection of children’s health by not only permitting but even encouraging the entry of fast food in schools’ cafeterias whilst heavily advertising it in front of them, the rubbish cattle and poultry eat (like dead pigs and dead horses), the rubbish in the ground meat (which brings “far more fecal bacteria in the average American kitchen sink than on the average American toilet seat”), etc.All that should warn us of the danger not only of the consequences of bad eating but also of carelessly ignoring the fast food influence on our society, from health to economics, politics and even aesthetics. Are we truly intended to be remembered, for generations to come, as that dark age of fat people who never cared what they put in their mouth? Wake up, people, says Eric Schlosser all along his disquieting study, speak up, don’t let yourself slaughtered on the table of big profit and low esteem of the huge companies. You have the power to stop it, do it before it is too late:Pull open the glass door, feel the rush of cool air, walk inside, get in line, and look around you, look at the kids working in the kitchen, at the customers in their seats, at the ads for the latest toys, study the backlit color photographs above the counter, think about where the food came from, about how and where it was made, about what is set in motion by every single fast food purchase, the ripple effect near and far, think about it. Then place your order. Or turn and walk out the door. It's not too late. Even in this fast food nation, you can still have it your way."
46,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21444131-katie,3,"Writing wise, this book is bogged down with a lot of economic and business statistics and information, and while I’m sure that’s fascinating for some people, for me it was dry and difficult to trudge through sometimes. The historical background information started to get boring as well; I suppose I had expected and hoped for more of a human interest aspect. The stories that stood out the most to me were the ones about employees being mistreated and taken advantage of in meatpacking facilities, and the high injury rates among those workers. Oh, and also the fact that it is someone’s job to literally slit the throats of hundreds of cows a day!Content wise, I was generally appalled by what I read in Fast Food Nation, but I came away from this thinking that the fast food industry is just one part of a huge, greedy, corrupt system. I am now more concerned about the lack of regulation and accountability within the meatpacking industry and the negative effects of globalization and Americanization of the world, but I suppose all of those things I just mentioned go hand in hand.Although this might seem like a chicken-or-the-egg type situation, the author does make the excellent point that huge companies do have the power to shift the behavior of their suppliers if that’s what is being demanded by enough consumers. McDonald’s, for example, is one of the world’s top purchasers of beef, potatoes and chicken, so if it started requiring that the slaughterhouses and feedlots they do business with take better care of their workers and take more precaution in the preparation of the product, these companies would have to comply if they wanted to keep making money (much like when Nike was forced by consumers to address the poor working conditions in sweatshops in Asia).I would think that most people know about this kind of thing by now and either don’t care or don’t think one person can make a difference, since it is such a huge system that is so ingrained in our society. I definitely fall in the latter category, so this book made me feel somewhat helpless, not to mention hopeless! However, the new afterward does talk about the shift in food culture in America in the last 10 or so years since Fast Food Nation was published, the new focus on sustainability and nutrition, different programs to bring agriculture and food education to inner cities, etc., so maybe there is hope after all. Random side note: While reading this, I realized that I've eaten in a McDonald’s in almost every country I've been to (which is admittedly not a huge list) and it’s crazy to think about the “humble beginnings” of this huge fast food empire."
47,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651844-luann,4,"Wow, so much information! I found this very readable yet also very disturbing - which is exactly what I believe Eric Schlosser meant to do. This was first published in 2001. The edition I read was published in 2002 and included a new afterword where Schlosser discussed some of the feedback and results from his book. I would love to read an edition updated to 2010. I'm sure much of what he discussed has changed in that amount of time.My favorite part of the book was his section on the flavors, colors and smells of processed food provided by ""natural flavor,"" ""artificial flavor,"" and color additives. That section alone was worth reading the entire book - although it made me very suspicious of all sorts of food I eat and not just fast food! Schlosser says: ""For the past 20 years, food processors have tried hard to use only ""natural flavors"" in their products. According to the FDA, these must be derived entirely from natural sources--from herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, beef, chicken, yeast, bark, roots, etc. Consumers prefer to see natural flavors on a label, out of a belief that they are healthier. The distinction between artifical and natural flavors can be somewhat arbitrary and absurd, based more on how the flavor has been made than on what it actually contains.""Just a few other things I found interesting and/or disturbing:""The Golden Arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.""""America's fast food restaurants are now more attractive to armed robbers than convenience stores, gas stations, or banks. Other retail businesses increasingly rely upon credit card transactions, but fast food restaurants still do almost all of their business in cash.""""For years, some of the most questionable ground beef in the United States was purchased by the USDA--and then distributed to school cafeterias throughout the country.""""Having played a central role in the creation of a meatpacking system that can spread bacterial contamination far and wide, the fast food chains are now able to avoid many of the worst consequences....The enormous buying power of the fast food giants has given them access to some of the cleanest ground beef. The meatpacking industry is now willing to perform the sort of rigorous testing for fast food chains that it refuses to do for the general public. Anyone who brings raw ground beef into his or her kitchen today must regard it as a potential biohazard...""I'm sure I won't stop eating fast food altogether, but this book will certainly make me think about it first!"
48,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656082-carly,4,"Something occurred to me while finishing this book. While I was reading Fast Food Nation, I was also finishing the seventh Harry Potter. Everyone who had already read HP told me how good it is, how they cried, etc. And yes, HP was endearing. But FFN was to an even greater extent I feel. While most readers engage themselves in fiction, nonfiction is highly ignored—and I’m guilty of this maybe more than anyone else. But reading FFN gave me all of the same strong emotions that reading fiction does. I am angered at the villain (in this case large corporations that will do anything for money, including lie to their clients), and I feel emotionally attached to the victims—the rancher, the meatpacker, the fast food franchisee, and the consumer of this meat. But then the realization hits me—this is real. These huge corporations are really recruiting poor, unskilled laborers, often immigrants to perform very dangerous jobs, refusing them decent wages, insurance, or worse yet, workers compensation when they hurt themselves. While it is true that the evidence is anecdotal, it is perhaps the only evidence that will ever be available, since these companies have a long unpunished history of lying. Lying to their workers, lying to the government, and lying to their customers. At first I was simply horrified by the human aspect. How terribly these companies treat their workers. It is extremely despicable, but even I cannot capture all of the terrors. You’ll have to read the book to understand. But after the human aspect, FFN took a twist toward The Jungle. Sinclair would be truly pleased. The fact that these companies are so powerful, they don’t have to test their meats for salmonella or e. coli is awesome: unless you’re one of the millions of unsuspecting meat eaters in the world. It’s truly sickening how much power these companies have. The government has the power to recall all kinds of defective merchandise, but not potentially lethal meat. Obviously this book has a very liberal bias. But so do I, so I don’t mind much. It took a LONG time to read, but is worth it I feel. "
49,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4308227-jenn,1,"Hello PropagandaAlthough Eric Schlosser wasn’t paid 500 dollars by a socialist magazine, nor was he alive in 1904, his muckraking style and focused agenda mirror that of Upton Sinclair, the author of The Jungle. Characteristics that plague both Fast Food Nation and The Jungle include anti-capitalism, one sidedness, and convincing details that are enough to “make a vegetarian out of Arnold Schwarzenegger (Seattle Weakly),” or in Sinclair’s case, enough to launch a government investigation. Both Schlosser and Sinclair are examples of how large an impact journalism, or shall I say muckraking, can have in this free country we call America. Despite their seemingly good intentions, however, it is impossible to ignore the overly romantic, even manipulative way Sinclair and Schlosser present their views. They feel the need to attack capitalism and “greedy companies” for every single problem we face, from disease to drug abuse. Schlosser goes as far as blaming armed robberies on McDonald’s policies rather than the criminals themselves. On the other hand, Schlosser portrays every single unskilled, blue-collar worker as a helpless victim, chewed up and spit out by evil companies. What’s more, I couldn’t help but notice that Kenny’s story from Fast Food Nation was remarkably similar to that of Jurgis’s. But I am not fooled. I am righteous enough to challenge this propaganda and think logically for myself. Sinclair and Schlosser are trying to turn boss and worker against each other; they are trying to make enemies out of partners. There is no good guy or bad guy in this scenario. This is not a comic book; this is real life and real life comes with problems that we work together to fix. What saddens me most about Fast Food Nation is the prospect that all the time and research put into explaining, “why fries taste good,” could’ve been used to expose the live boiling of cats in China, or to enlighten underprivileged children on the importance of education.

Perhaps it's a case of me having worked in the food production sector, as well as in food safety and in customer service. Perhaps I'm just a cynical bugger already, but this was mildly interesting as opposed to rocking my world in any senseThe author attempts to do a Naomi Klein 'No Logo' on the subject of 'Super Size Me' (which this precedes). It's well researched and generally comes over as convincing and properly grounded. By this I probably mean that the bias is subtle and not forced down the throat of the reader - the later sections on microbiology (about which I have expertise) contained a number of inaccuracies and assumptions which made me expect that the earlier chapters had also been slanted in the same manner. However, the key messages are pretty sound, and it was an interesting - albeit possibly now fifteen years further worse down the line in some areas and fifteen years better in others - read.I just found some of the criticisms of the industry a little assuming. Lots about the dangers (obesity, working conditions) and not so much about the benefits (convenience, employment) and an almost complete lack of acknowledgement of free will and choice. Yes, it's not great that kids are exposed to adverts, but there is money for schools from these companies. Teenage staff are poorly paid and have a hard introduction to working life, but if they didn't have these jobs they wouldn't earn a bit of money and get a bit of independence. Fast food businesses puts huge demands on food processors who cut corners to keep it cheap, but that's because consumers put huge demands on fast food businesses to cut corners and keep it cheap. If you eat too much crap you will be unhealthy, but if you didn't know that then you deserve to get spotty and fat. There is such a thing as choice and this means parents can be responsible about what their kids eat, and be responsible about their own diets too. "

Larger ethical issues are addressed as well, along the lines of who has the power to regulate food. I was shocked at what I read here, and I already assumed it was pretty bad. I'm now questioning purchasing processed food at all. Blech. As always, some quotations:  “After closing my eyes, I suddenly smelled a grilled hamburger. The aroma was uncanny, almost miraculous. It smelled like someone in the room was flipping burgers on a hot grill. But when I opened my eyes, there was just a narrow strip of white paper and a smiling flavorist.”“Each steer deposits about fifty pounds of manure every day… The amount of waste left by the cattle that pass through Weld County is staggering. The two Monfort feedlots outside Greenley produce more excrement than the cities of Denver, Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis – combined.” “The market is a tool, and a useful one. But the worship of this tool is a hollow faith. Far more important than any tool is what you make with it. Many of America’s greatest accomplishments stand in complete defiance of the free market: the prohibition of child labor, the establishment of a minimum wage, the creation of wilderness areas and national parks, the construction of dams, bridges, roads, churches, schools, and universities.” “Much like the workings of the market, technology is just one means to an end, not something to be celebrated for its own sake.” “No society in human history worshipped science more devoutly or more blindly than the Soviet Union, where “scientific socialism” was considered the highest truth. And no society has ever suffered so much environmental devastation on such a massive scale.” "

I can easily sit here and say I'll never touch fast food again but that would be a lie. I will say I will make a bigger attempt to not touch it especially when I think of hygiene and what people do, how organizations work, how employees are mistreated and abused. Thinking of that will help me stop eating this food. Definitely recommend someone reading it for an insight on how it all began, how these organizations work, what is the result of eating fast food, how many billions of dollars are spent, which is still shocking and how we as individuals should think twice before pulling up to a drive through because let's face it, how many people actually want to take the time to get out of their car nowadays to go inside and get their food when it's so easy to just have someone hand it to you while you sit in the comfort of your car.

This book gave me a very good insight towards the fast food industry we have, how the food industry has changed with the introduction of fast food, the power of lobbying with the mass large firms in U.S. and many others.. It shed so much light on how this humongous industry functions and how it became what it becameWhat intrigued me throughout this read was how disgusting firms can be in protecting themselves and in their quest for seeking more profits. And I guess this doesn't apply to just food but to many other industries in the world. And the chapter on meat, meat packing and the diseases. I squirmed at every page of it but boy, it was like reality slapping in my face. I'll never look at meat the same way again. Definitely a good read."

Instead of focusing solely on the food, Schlosser wrote a lot about the fast food industry itself and how people are being consummately sucked into buying their food. Some of the parts pertaining to the business aspects of fast food lost my attention - however, the tidbits on the working conditions and the ingredients of the unhealthy indulgences made me want to read more. I usually do not visit fast food restaurants, so this book has not drastically changed my eating habits. Despite this, I felt like I learned a lot about how the corporations and businesses work."

Up until the last 2 chapters, I couldn’t go more than a couple of sub chapters at a time because I just got so mad and so heartbroken at the eye opening and really horrific details that the author goes into.Every time I opened my Kindle, I had to take stock of how I was feeling that day, if I could handle more information that would make me want to tear my hair out or break my already fragile heart. And most days, I opted to skip Fast Food Nation because I just couldn’t handle it. But I soldiered on. I realised we just needed to face the ugly truth and being ignorant is NOT bliss. It does more harm than any good. So about once a week, I steel my nerves and read maybe 5 to 10 pages and quit before I do irreparable damage to my nerves and my heart. I do have to commend the author for a thorough investigation into this entire segment of business. While I knew it wasn’t healthy to eat, I did not know quite the extent of it. Nor did I realise just how much it hurt those who worked in the industry. Sure, life is money and money is business. But, I’m increasingly cognisant of the fact that we can still make money while having a conscience and being fair towards others. This whole scarcity mentality is NOT real and we should rise above this self-centredness we’re all guilty of. Nobody has to lose for you to win.

It was not just that the food is bad for you, the fast food companies themselves (and the suppliers that cater to their whim) were rotten from top to bottom.From the cattle that were fed abominable things (chicken manure, cattle and poultry body parts, even dead cats and dogs), to the slaughterhouse that care naught about the safety of the workers or of the hygiene of the process (resulting in meat sprayed with shit, etc), to the fast food joints that also care naught for the welfare of the workers or for the well-being of their customers, I really really underestimated the atrocities a businessman is capable of.The author said that the CEOs were not evil men, only businessmen, I disagree. A decent human being would never enabled such atrocities, as a few good fast food chain that the author mentioned proved. As it seemed that the bigger the companies, the more amoral they become, it would be better to spend your money on small local business instead.P.S. I'm pretty sure that fast food companies aren't the only one screwing us. Any suggestion on books shedding light on other multi-billion companies' evil doings?"

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
63,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
64,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it. "
65,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

66,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41111297-shadowjac,1,"Wow what a piece of garbage that was, I mean I knew it was propaganda when I picked it out but seriously. Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.

The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA.

68,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244232-evan-wright,5,"Schlosser is such an astonishingly great reporter and writer. When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "

""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "

This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries.

Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have.

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW!

It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
74,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."

By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "

His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while.

92,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3091902-ape,5,"Wow! I am very impressed by this book. It is so thoroughly researched and presented in a well-thought out and interesting way. Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
93,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
94,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it. "
95,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

96,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41111297-shadowjac,1,"Wow what a piece of garbage that was, I mean I knew it was propaganda when I picked it out but seriously. Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.  This author hates:Fast-food a lack of cowboy hats in the southDisneya lack of citrus fruitfranchisees McDonaldsMcDonaldsMcDonalds"
97,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3303892-jakob,5,"I don't really know what to say about this book, or that is of its contents. The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA. Like I said I think it's pretty great but it could be a hell of a lot greater."
98,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244232-evan-wright,5,"Schlosser is such an astonishingly great reporter and writer. When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "
99,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35057663-sean-takada,4,"I chose to read this book because I had read the book ""Chew On This"", a few years before, and the book was written by the same author. ""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "
100,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374491-ashlie,5,"As a food lover and health enthusiast, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I'm going to eat in order to have a healthy and balanced diet. This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries. Just makes you wonder what exactly is in everything else..."
101,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8578690-heather,4,"Wow. This book made me thankful for the decision I made 9 years ago to be a vegetarian. One line can't leave my mind, ""There is shit in the meat."" Um. Yeah. It took me quite a few days to read this dense book. It's depressing, albeit captivating, information. Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have. Why are some people so greedy and heartless?On a lighter note, kudos to In-N-Out burger, clearly a leader in humane practice, cleanliness, and quality in the fast food world.

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW! This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it! Respected it...hated it...2 stars."
103,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki,4,"I put this book on the ""sustainability"" shelf although it's more about UNsustainability. It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
104,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."
105,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489335-didi,3,"Finally finished this. Was often overwhelming and wordy, but gave hope in the end. It all comes down to money. By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "

The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"

I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while.

I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff. (The book is unscathed--resisted the temptation) The link below mentions ConAgra's Greeley Plant, one of the subjects of Schlosser's research."
109,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."

Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc?

Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
123,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
124,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it. "
125,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars. "
126,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41111297-shadowjac,1,"Wow what a piece of garbage that was, I mean I knew it was propaganda when I picked it out but seriously. Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.  This author hates:Fast-food a lack of cowboy hats in the southDisneya lack of citrus fruitfranchisees McDonaldsMcDonaldsMcDonalds"
127,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3303892-jakob,5,"I don't really know what to say about this book, or that is of its contents. The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA. Like I said I think it's pretty great but it could be a hell of a lot greater."
128,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244232-evan-wright,5,"Schlosser is such an astonishingly great reporter and writer. When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "
129,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35057663-sean-takada,4,"I chose to read this book because I had read the book ""Chew On This"", a few years before, and the book was written by the same author. ""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "
130,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374491-ashlie,5,"As a food lover and health enthusiast, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I'm going to eat in order to have a healthy and balanced diet. This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries. Just makes you wonder what exactly is in everything else..."
131,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8578690-heather,4,"Wow. This book made me thankful for the decision I made 9 years ago to be a vegetarian. One line can't leave my mind, ""There is shit in the meat."" Um. Yeah. It took me quite a few days to read this dense book. It's depressing, albeit captivating, information. Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have. Why are some people so greedy and heartless?On a lighter note, kudos to In-N-Out burger, clearly a leader in humane practice, cleanliness, and quality in the fast food world. I love a good grilled cheese burger from In-N-Out... :)"

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW! This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it! Respected it...hated it...2 stars."
133,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki,4,"I put this book on the ""sustainability"" shelf although it's more about UNsustainability. It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
134,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."
135,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489335-didi,3,"Finally finished this. Was often overwhelming and wordy, but gave hope in the end. It all comes down to money. By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "
136,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855256-sandeep,3,"Rating 3.75/5This is a well researched book. It may be an eye opener for few people, but for me, NO. The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"
137,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,5,"Schlosser's research here is so careful...his pages and pages of notes at the end of the book MAKE me believe. I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while. I'm sure if he focused his attention on fruit and vegetable markets, I'd truly have to go hungry.Well written, disturbing."

It MAY put you off your feed--just a warning, towards the end, especially. Schlosser mentions Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle quite a bit during the chapters about meatpacking. I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff. (The book is unscathed--resisted the temptation) The link below mentions ConAgra's Greeley Plant, one of the subjects of Schlosser's research."
139,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."

The government, which can spy on us, can imprison us, can tell us what to do, cannot take tainted meat back. It cannot even force companies to recall the tainted foodstuff. The bad news is that the American lifestyle is fast becoming the Global Lifestyle. With all the attendant obesity and pollution and disease carrying vectors that entails.

On the other, it was just not a fun read. Every section filled me with rage, paranoia, or both; it was so unsettling. So in terms of my actual enjoyment, this was more like two stars. But in terms of whether or not it accomplished its purpose, definitely five.

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
153,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."

No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it.

155,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

156,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41111297-shadowjac,1,"Wow what a piece of garbage that was, I mean I knew it was propaganda when I picked it out but seriously. Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.  This author hates:Fast-food a lack of cowboy hats in the southDisneya lack of citrus fruitfranchisees McDonaldsMcDonaldsMcDonalds"
157,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3303892-jakob,5,"I don't really know what to say about this book, or that is of its contents. The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA. Like I said I think it's pretty great but it could be a hell of a lot greater."
158,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244232-evan-wright,5,"Schlosser is such an astonishingly great reporter and writer. When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "
159,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35057663-sean-takada,4,"I chose to read this book because I had read the book ""Chew On This"", a few years before, and the book was written by the same author. ""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "
160,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374491-ashlie,5,"As a food lover and health enthusiast, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I'm going to eat in order to have a healthy and balanced diet. This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries. Just makes you wonder what exactly is in everything else..."
161,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8578690-heather,4,"Wow. This book made me thankful for the decision I made 9 years ago to be a vegetarian. One line can't leave my mind, ""There is shit in the meat."" Um. Yeah. It took me quite a few days to read this dense book. It's depressing, albeit captivating, information. Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have. Why are some people so greedy and heartless?On a lighter note, kudos to In-N-Out burger, clearly a leader in humane practice, cleanliness, and quality in the fast food world. I love a good grilled cheese burger from In-N-Out... :)"

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW! This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it! Respected it...hated it...2 stars."
163,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki,4,"I put this book on the ""sustainability"" shelf although it's more about UNsustainability. It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
164,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."
165,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489335-didi,3,"Finally finished this. Was often overwhelming and wordy, but gave hope in the end. It all comes down to money. By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "
166,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855256-sandeep,3,"Rating 3.75/5This is a well researched book. It may be an eye opener for few people, but for me, NO. The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"
167,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,5,"Schlosser's research here is so careful...his pages and pages of notes at the end of the book MAKE me believe. I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while. I'm sure if he focused his attention on fruit and vegetable markets, I'd truly have to go hungry.Well written, disturbing."

It MAY put you off your feed--just a warning, towards the end, especially. Schlosser mentions Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle quite a bit during the chapters about meatpacking. I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff. (The book is unscathed--resisted the temptation) The link below mentions ConAgra's Greeley Plant, one of the subjects of Schlosser's research."
169,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."
170,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145963-deetya,5,"Wow! Great book. This is what happens when you have unfettered capitalism in the food industry. The government, which can spy on us, can imprison us, can tell us what to do, cannot take tainted meat back. It cannot even force companies to recall the tainted foodstuff. The bad news is that the American lifestyle is fast becoming the Global Lifestyle. With all the attendant obesity and pollution and disease carrying vectors that entails. Stephen Hawking is right, humanity is on its way to destroy itself. "

On the other, it was just not a fun read. Every section filled me with rage, paranoia, or both; it was so unsettling. So in terms of my actual enjoyment, this was more like two stars. But in terms of whether or not it accomplished its purpose, definitely five. It succeeding in opening my eyes and making me more conscious of the corporations that control our world and the need for change. So I decided to go with the middle ground. Four stars."

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
183,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
184,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it.

""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.

The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA.

When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "

""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "

This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries.

One line can't leave my mind, ""There is shit in the meat."" Um. Yeah. It took me quite a few days to read this dense book. It's depressing, albeit captivating, information. Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have. Why are some people so greedy and heartless?On a lighter note, kudos to In-N-Out burger, clearly a leader in humane practice, cleanliness, and quality in the fast food world.

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW! This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it!

It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
194,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."

By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "

The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"

I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while.

I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff.

199,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
213,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
214,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it.

""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about.

When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan."" I look forward to reading Schlosser's upcoming book on prisons. "

""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "

This is tricky of course, because there is so much conflicting information about what exactly ""healthy and balanced"" means but I try my best.Although I rarely (only on car trips) eat fast food, this book has probably curbed me of even that habit. Schlosser does a good job of explaining the entire history of the fast food industry, and the changes it has made to our nation, in a way that I feel is balanced and fair. Some corporations and the meat/potato packing industries come out looking very badly, but that's only because it seems they are doing bad things.Other than Raising Cane's (regional, chicken fingers, started in Louisiana) I believe I am off of fast food completely. A lot of the information in this book resonates with me, and I won't soon forget it, but the things I'll remember most is that McDonald's uses ""beef flavoring"" in the french fries. Just makes you wonder what exactly is in everything else..."

One line can't leave my mind, ""There is shit in the meat."" Um. Yeah. It took me quite a few days to read this dense book. It's depressing, albeit captivating, information. Corporate greed, monopolization, political coercion, and consistent and rampant inability to treat humanity with kindness seem to be America's greatest pastimes, so I don't know why I feel so shocked by them in the McEpidemic described in Fast Food Nation.Fast Food Nation is a fascinating anthropological and cultural read, despite its nauseating and maddening revelations about fast food and the corporations that enable them. If I were a billionaire, I would stop expanding and start enriching the lives of the current ""family"" I have. Why are some people so greedy and heartless?On a lighter note, kudos to In-N-Out burger, clearly a leader in humane practice, cleanliness, and quality in the fast food world.

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW! This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it!

223,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki,4,"I put this book on the ""sustainability"" shelf although it's more about UNsustainability. It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
224,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."

By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "
226,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855256-sandeep,3,"Rating 3.75/5This is a well researched book. It may be an eye opener for few people, but for me, NO. The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"
227,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,5,"Schlosser's research here is so careful...his pages and pages of notes at the end of the book MAKE me believe. I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while. I'm sure if he focused his attention on fruit and vegetable markets, I'd truly have to go hungry.Well written, disturbing."

It MAY put you off your feed--just a warning, towards the end, especially. Schlosser mentions Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle quite a bit during the chapters about meatpacking. I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff. (The book is unscathed--resisted the temptation) The link below mentions ConAgra's Greeley Plant, one of the subjects of Schlosser's research."
229,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."

The government, which can spy on us, can imprison us, can tell us what to do, cannot take tainted meat back. It cannot even force companies to recall the tainted foodstuff. The bad news is that the American lifestyle is fast becoming the Global Lifestyle. With all the attendant obesity and pollution and disease carrying vectors that entails.

But in terms of whether or not it accomplished its purpose, definitely five.

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
243,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
244,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it.

245,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.

The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA.

And this book was deserved by the public, and I respect it as an idea and as a telling immensely.But OH MY GOD did I hate reading it. This book had two settings for me: Boring and disgusting. BORING: This guy can ramble on and on for almost fifty pages about the life of Carl whatsit, but it just doesn't matter to me. I get it. He started off small, he got really big, he thinks he's improved life as we know it. Yay! Do we need all that, all those dates and times and sidetracks and backtracks he sticks in everywhere? It was hard to follow and hard to are about.DISGUSTING: I know, I know, we can't sugarcoat the truth. I've said that myself. But EW! Okay? EW!

It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
254,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."

By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "

The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"

I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while.

I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff.

Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."

Plus he hasn´t demonised any particular party in the story and doesn´t just rant about everything that´s wrong with the system, but also suggests ways of making things better.None of this really shocked me in that I´ve always understood that these big international fast food corporations are more about cashing in rather than being concerned about their workers, the food quality etc, but I hadn´t really appreciated to what extent this had/still is going on. Everybody knows workers are paid appaulling wages and the food isn´t fantastic. It just cashes in on the desperation of people - teenagers who can´t get jobs elsewhere, immigrints who are desperate etc.So I´m not naive to the world and its ways, but I still get so mad when I read about these big executives, who know what´s going on but blatently couldn´t give a toss, and see the workers down the bottom of the scale as disposable machines. All that matters is increasing profits. Ugh. It´s quite depressing in a way. Thousands of years of human evolution, discovery and developement and this is where we got to? Exploiting the majority of workers, feeding our customers crap all in the name of making money...This corporate mentality of enforcing ways of thinking and attitudes on workers is really depressing. Some of the ""case studies"" of particular people were so sad - these workers maimed and mutilated in the slaughterhouses; and then whilst in the hospital being forced to sign away their rights to the meat companies so that the company doesnt get in trouble. One of the saddest though, was the ranch man, Hank, who ended up committing suicide under all the pressures.So has this actually made anyone want to boycott MacDonalds, Burger King etc? I don´t really eat at those places because I don´t eat meat; but I also find them a bit mass produced, plastic fantastic and almost tacky. It´s just grim that the same thing should be found all over the world. After reading this book, I will probably avoid these kinds of places even more than I usually do!I do like the fact that he remains positive, and does think that changes can be made to make it all better. Just feel the need to quote the very end of the book now...""This new century may bring an impatience with conformity, a refusal to be kept in the dark, less greed, more compassion, less speed, more common sense, a sense of humor about brand essences and loyalties, a view of food as more than just fuel. Things don´t have to be the way they are. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic.""2016 note: taken from my 2008 bookcrossing journal."
273,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes,5,"I wish I had read this book sooner than I did. Ignorance was bliss, but learning how the food I put in my body is made has opened my eyes. Reading about how meat gets to the plate was very disturbing. I certainly didn't know that most of the meat Americans consume has feces in it, not to mention a high occurrence of food-borne pathogens like E coli. And while I could've guessed that conditions at slaughterhouses aren't all that humane for the animals, I had no idea there are so many recent examples of the workers being injured or killed simply by doing their jobs and trying to meet the dangerous and unreasonable speed requirements.But the most disturbing thing of all was the link between the rise of fast food in this country and the rise in obesity in our children. This is no mistake -- it's not a secret that the fast food companies have purposefully targeted children in their advertising campaigns. They learned from marketing experts that if you can get a kid to start eating your food at a young age, you've got a customer for life. And that customer is most likely going to be overweight, if not obese, and have an increased risk of health disease and cancer (among other things) and a decrease in life expectancy.We should not stand for this any longer. Fast food companies need to stop marketing unhealthy food to children. They need to get out of our schools or change their in-school menus to have only healthy, nutritious foods.I read this book as part of a small book club with some friends, none of us with school-age children. When we were discussing it, we decided to look into starting a garden at a school where kids can learn about how food grows and what's healthy to put in their bodies. We found out there's already a garden at a school on the other side of town (literally) that desperately needs volunteers, so we're going to get together and do what we can to help."
274,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"This is one of those books like Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" that tells us truths about our food that we sort of already knew, or at least suspected, but probably didn't really want to have dragged out into the harsh light of day to be confronted. No one reading this book is going to be surprised to learn that fast food isn't very good and isn't very healthy. But you will learn just HOW unhealthy it is. It's not just that the raw materials are of low quality and processed beyond recognition, until they're almost devoid of nutritive content. It's also that the regulatory agencies we think are ensuring the safety of the food we eat are under the thumb of the fast food industry, and this book tells some real horror stories about contamination and unsanitary food preparation.But ""Fast Food Nation"" won't just appall you with regard to what you put in your mouth. It also tells us how the industry works, how fast food has contributed to the decline of the family farm, why so much of America's farmland and beef and chicken industries exist to service fast food chains, and the dirty, dangerous, and low-paid conditions in which employees throughout the supply chain work. Your Big Mac has a real cost, both economic and social.The author did not write some kind of socialist anti-business screed, though. Schlosser writes with humor and an appreciation for the quintessential Americanness of fast food. He traces the rise of McDonald's and Carl's Jr., and how they are linked to Disney, takes us inside their corporate headquarters, and shows us some other American businesses that have resisted the mass produced uniformity of fast food.""Fast Food Nation"" takes a long hard look at the industry, but it's not an expose so much as an ""unauthorized biography""... of the business and the people involved in it.

275,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"Well, here it is! My first read book of 2017! Also, my GOD was it a good one! ""Fast Food Nation"" is both horrifying and brilliant. It has the perfect balance of facts and extremely well backed-up opinions. I don't want to go to McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, and other fast food restaurants for a LONG while now. However, the parts that I was expecting to love were not my favorite parts of the book. The parts about the food itself was really good and very well researched (and horrifying), but I ADORED the parts about the business and human side to the fast food industry. I am disgusted by the food, but I am more convinced to not go to McDonald's due to the business aspect. LOADS of people are ripped off on a daily basis by these fast food chains and the world for them only seems to get worse. I am not very well aware of the world of the 21st century fast food scene, since this book focuses more on the 20th century side of it, but I only expect that things haven't been the brightest for the workers and farmers that are involved with this industry. I know, thanks to this book that McDonald's, in its financial hay day, was a BOOMING success that made millionaires the way that Apple and Google make millionaires today. McDonald's was THE company for the high potential businessmen. It was one of the most HORRIFIC for the common citizen. So overall, I think that ""Fast Food Nation"" was a fantastic book to kick off this year with. It was extremely informative and it perfectly balances facts with legitimate opinions. You do not know how hard it is to balance those two things well. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this book and I am so happy I bought this book. It was phenomenal! I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.

Some general complaints I have not even expressing my beliefs on the subject matter is the fact that this guy seems to go out on a tangent a lot, for example when the author got to the chapter talking about the cattle industry he spends about fifteen pages musing on a city and a lack of cowboy hats on young people, instead of talking about the food industry. Hey, let's spend twenty pages on how Walt Disney is a huge jerk and (GASP) marketed to children, instead of talking about food, yeah that's relevant.. I find these parts break the pace of the book and our mostly pointless if I wanted to read about how the movie industry was awful I’d pull my dust covered copy of Harry Potter and the Paganization of Culture off my shelf.  Getting into my more personal views on the fast-food industry I still don't like this book, because while I certainly don't think of them as saints this book seems to think of them as demons with McDonald's as a succubus tempting us and getting us to lower our guard before she steals our life force. The book is pure and simple propaganda, there is no attempt made to portray the food industry's side of the argument.

The USA is in many respects a very attractive country with many great qualities. But it seems to me that so many of the good qualities of America are offset by the bad and then some. The image I often get is that the majority of Americans are very proud of their country, the land of opportunity and home of the free, and have an abundance patriotism to the degree of over sweetness to my admittedly dry tastes. It's this image that I find so difficult to reconcile with the America I keep finding in the books I read whether it be books like these that talk about how awfully immigrant and low class workers are treated in the states, how the food is becoming closer to something you would find in an industrial chemical plant (Omnivore's Dilemma), or in other more political works talking about the more shady goings on in American political life (The Shock Doctrine). It seems to me that the USA is a bit schizophrenic in it's personality. All these great ideals on the surface but underneath lurk a lot of dark things that people don't want to have to think about. I think books like these are a pretty good medicine. At least it means that there are people out there who are willing to at least try to do some housecleaning.p.s. I'm not Bashing the USA.

When I read this I was struck by his ability to build narrative out of dense, detailed reporting. When this book came out I was lucky enough to hear Schlosser read at the (now closed) Dutton's Books in Brentwood. I knew nothing about him or the book when I showed up. But his reading had the energy of a religious awakening. I think this came more from the crowd, than from Schlosser who was almost cryptically self-effacing in his delivery. I read the book both as a reporter, trying to figure out his methods and as a fan. One of the lines that struck me was his account of Disney teaming with McDonald's meaning, as Schlosser wrote (quoting from memory), 'It is now possible to get a Happy Meal at the happiest place on earth.' This line, so true but also sly and damning, is one of the great moments of the book. A few years later when I wrote about American troops' dismay at learning there are no McDonald's in Kandahar (in a story for Rolling Stone, now included in Hella Nation) I was able to pay small personal homage to Schlosser when I wrote, ""The soldiers stare at the sergeant while the news sinks in: There are no Happy Meals in Afghanistan.""

""Chew On This"" was an interesting book, so I started reading ""Fast Food Nation"". This book is divided into two sections; one where all the biographies of successful men of fast food franchises are told, and the second section is about the hazardous ingredients in fries and burgers. Something that amazed me was that most of the people who started their businesses were not the wealthiest of people, but they started their business in hope for success. “Twenty years ago, teenage boys in the United States drank twice as much milk as soda; now they drink twice as much soda as milk.” Schlosser 54.This is a quote that shocked me, because it meant that the modern life is getting unhealthier and unhealthier, and example Schlosser showed how fast-food restaurants have impacted health and life. Overall, this book is a profound and detailed book that I enjoyed reading a lot. I recommend to read ""Chew On This"" first, since it gives a main idea on the ingredients in burgers and fries and how they are processed, where as ""Fast Food Nation"" goes into more detail. "

This just keeps going, getting turned to lard and pulling out kidneys with your bare hands and scrubbing dried blood off the roof? Couldn't stand it! I just couldn't stand it! Respected it...hated it...2 stars."
283,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki,4,"I put this book on the ""sustainability"" shelf although it's more about UNsustainability. It's a while since I read it, but I do know that it helped me cut way down on my consumption of fast food! (Even before I saw Super Size Me!)My real concern about fast food is what it may be doing to people in the lower socio-economic groups of our nation. In my previous life in the big city, I rode the bus a lot, and many of my fellow riders fell into this category. I overheard many conversations that showed the influence of fast-food advertising on them; as we'd pass billboards showing the latest sandwich from Burger King or MacDonald's there would be serious conversations about how they ""had to get one of those."" One could argue that fast food is perpetrating racial and economic genocide on certain populations by habituating them to salty, greasy, high-calorie foods. Everyone should read this book. "
284,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"Oog. I knew most of this already, but I don't think I knew it was this bad. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, the environment, animals all suffer with the fast food industry. For most of the book, I felt pretty smug and glad that I rarely visit a fast food chain. But at a certain point, that's a mark of my privilege and isn't really anything to be that proud of. Actual action would be better.Schlosser's point that the ""free market"" is just a bit of rhetoric to avoid regulation and oversight is well taken. Regulation is bad, government subsidies, contracts, and taxbreaks are good. And I'm starting to believe that to get next-level wealth pretty much means you have to do bad things--unethical, inconsistent, mental-gymnastic justifications, giving up on compassion and an appreciation of anything but profits. And the more I read about Reagan, the less I like the mess his puppetmasters left us all in."
285,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489335-didi,3,"Finally finished this. Was often overwhelming and wordy, but gave hope in the end. It all comes down to money. By demanding that our food suppliers use fair wage, safe, hygenic, and humane practices, we change the industry faster than any governmental law or involvement. A good read to start changing what you eat. After watching Jaime Oliver's Food Revolution and seeing how a chicken nugget is made, then Supersize Me for the first time, and then seeing Food Inc. last night on PBS, I am HORRIFIED at how political our food production system has become. Understanding how I can be a better consumer and stear food practices back on track is empowering. Back to food storage, back to gardening and canning, back to cooking from scratch, back to whole foods. Knowing what you are eating really turns your tastes away from the salty, sweet, fatty things that are being subsidized. "
286,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855256-sandeep,3,"Rating 3.75/5This is a well researched book. It may be an eye opener for few people, but for me, NO. The reason being, I have never ever eaten at the Subway/KFC/McD (never meaning not even once). And I go by a vegan diet.The book covers lots of ground, - how the fast food industry emerged/evolved/sustained itself over the years.- how the farmers/ranchers in the US were affected by this growth of fast food chains.- how the fast food chains provided employment to the American people.- some of the ill effects on kids/people after consuming fast food.- plight of some of the immigrant workers who work for low wages in the slaughter houses.- some of the strategies used by these organizations to reap more benefits.A workaround or solution to the problems could have been discussed, may be I am over expecting!Cheers,"
287,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,5,"Schlosser's research here is so careful...his pages and pages of notes at the end of the book MAKE me believe. I think the saddest fact is that the potato farmers only make 2 cents for each $1.50 bag of fast food fries. The heroes, the farmers and ranchers and workers, are the ones most victimized. His stories about tne meatpacking plants in Texas that force injured workers to sign medical waivers BEFORE treatment was sickening.Schlosser tells stories, about the leaders of the field, about the workers, about the dark underbelly (probably in someone's hamburger!) of this industry, truly put me off eating...for a while. I'm sure if he focused his attention on fruit and vegetable markets, I'd truly have to go hungry.Well written, disturbing."
288,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2475858-sharyl,4,"There is an amazing amount of information in this book, all very eye-opening. It MAY put you off your feed--just a warning, towards the end, especially. Schlosser mentions Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle quite a bit during the chapters about meatpacking. I haven't read it, but certainly will.If I'd have underlined everything I'd wanted to remember, the whole book would be marked up--it's all absorbing stuff. (The book is unscathed--resisted the temptation) The link below mentions ConAgra's Greeley Plant, one of the subjects of Schlosser's research."
289,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857168-kurt,5,"Like the Jungle, I think the public response to this book misses the bigger point. Yes, it's about fast food being bad for you, and ""stuff"" being in the meat. But it's much more about what the fast food industry as a system does to this country, from unsafe working conditions in meat packing plants to increased employee violence and theft to marketing targeted at children to create a need for comfort food later in life. I refused to read this book for a while because I already know fast food is bad for me, but this book challenged me to look at the problem in a variety of new ways."
290,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145963-deetya,5,"Wow! Great book. This is what happens when you have unfettered capitalism in the food industry. The government, which can spy on us, can imprison us, can tell us what to do, cannot take tainted meat back. It cannot even force companies to recall the tainted foodstuff. The bad news is that the American lifestyle is fast becoming the Global Lifestyle. With all the attendant obesity and pollution and disease carrying vectors that entails. Stephen Hawking is right, humanity is on its way to destroy itself. "
291,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22357959-jordan,4,"This is an iffy four stars. On one hand, I liked the writing style and found the book to be eye-opening. On the other, it was just not a fun read. Every section filled me with rage, paranoia, or both; it was so unsettling. So in terms of my actual enjoyment, this was more like two stars. But in terms of whether or not it accomplished its purpose, definitely five. It succeeding in opening my eyes and making me more conscious of the corporations that control our world and the need for change. So I decided to go with the middle ground. Four stars."
292,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6770267-chris,4,"Very readable non-fiction. Interesting, fascinating at times. Disgusting facts of reality at others, you'd rather not know, if you are a fast food eater ( as I have been for most of my adult life). Discusses much more than just the core of the fast food industry- the food & it's processing and implications for health. Looks at the impact of the industry on business models, working conditions, suburban sprawl, environment, etc. Lots of food for thought, pardon the pun."
293,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882960-michelle,5,"You will not eat fast food again. Guaranteed. In fact, it will change the way you eat-period. So, if you want to eat fast food, dont read this book. Very enlightening..food industry, manufacturing, etc. It really made me look at how what we do affects our entire world, eco, etc...how it has an impact on cultures, landscape, workforce etc. "
294,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42330888-rita-van-eck,5,"You think the burgers at McDonald's are bad? Read this and let Schlosser open your eyes to how vile and dehumanizing major corporations have become. It's not justthe chemicals in the patties - they are violating human rights, if it means more profit can be made. Fantastically written, an excellent example of proper investigative journalism. Get ready to quit the fast food industry."
295,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/585804-virginia,4,Excellent description of how the fast food industry started (think Ray Croc and Walt Disney)and how food production has changed to support that industry. Not for the squeamish. Now I know why some people become vegetarians! 
296,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24768940-david,4,"Every step along the way before the burger is served to you in McDonalds is tragic. For the animals, for the farmers, for the workers in the meatpacking process, and for the employees at McDonalds too."
297,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9119740-jill-mcgill,4,"Fast Food Nation is fascinating, disturbing and a big eye-opener! Let's just say, after reading this book you will never want to eat fast food again. You might even consider becoming a vegetarian. A must read!"
298,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96103477-johnny-martello,3,"A work of modern muckraking. Schlosser describes the fast food world as what it really is, a giant corporation in competition with itself. An account on the chemicals of the food, to the poor treatment of workers, a must read for those who can stomach the harsh reality of these easy meals."
299,0060838582,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216258-sean,4,"Never. Eat. Again. This book made me feel fat, and sick, and confirmed my fear of working in meatpacking plants."
