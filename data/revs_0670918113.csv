0,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"Updated 6/29/13 - see link at bottomThis book is one of the reasons people will occasionally look at you, slack-jawed, and say “How did you know that?” There are a few greater feelings in life, but not many. A-W picks a few dozen of the 118 known elements and tells us a bit about them, offering stories that might be about their discovery, how they are used, or other cultural looks-see. There is unevenness, to be sure. Some stories are more interesting than others, but the overall level is quite good, informative and entertaining.But wait, there’s more. For those of us with an affection for literary treasure-hunting, it is time to pick up some of the glowing tablets suspended in the air. A-W offers explanations and reference points for how certain materials are viewed culturally. For instance gold goes with power, iron with strength, grave lead, honest tin, virtuous silver, this is feminine, that is masculine, and so on. This is mother’s milk for those trying to ferret out elements of meaning in literature. You will learn about the first use of carbonated water, the derivation of the word tinker, which substance is known as “liquid fire”, some alarming facts about things that glow in the dark. We think of titanium as a material used in jets or rockets, but did you know that titanium oxide is widely used to make white paint? Metals come into and pass out of fashion. One particular poison was in such widespread use that it became known as “inheritance powder”. Why was there such a concentration of element discoveries in Norway? A-W has enough material here about color that he could write an entire book on the subject, and I hope he does.If you enjoy learning new things, Periodic Tales will tickle your brain, right down to the atoms. It’s elementary.==============================EXTRA STUFFAn article in the May 2013 issue of National Geographic looked at what was happening with creation of new elements. Fascinating material."
1,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809993-d-books,2,"The author goes off in too many directions with his story-telling for me to want to stick to reading his book. I read over a hundred pages and can't seem to find it interesting due to how the author goes about writing it. From memories of gathering as many elements of the periodic table during his childhood, to drawn out stories of how a present day person is producing charcoal, to historical tales of elements, and then to the author personally experimenting to abstract an element. It makes you want to beg the author to please pick a style of writing and stick with it. I'm going to find it hard to pick this book up again to finish."
2,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This wasn't quite as engaging to me as the blurb and the reviews quoted on the cover suggests -- in fact, it started to feel rather meandering -- but it is quite an interesting read, covering both the scientific history of elements, how and when they were discovered, and the social histories, why they were used and for what. Some facts I didn't know; other parts I got impatient with: yes, yes, I know all that.Overall, worth a read if it sounds interesting to you, but be prepared to skip bits where he's telling you things you're not interested in/already know."
3,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"I will admit that I am starting to get a bit weary of popular science books. Do not get me wrong being trained as a chemist and working in science and engineering for many years I find these books fascinating. The problem lies in the fact that the subject is so huge they have to give a hook, something personal that will get the reading not only interested but also to connect with the book. Now I will admit I have read my fair shore of this type of book only to realise I either have nothing in common with the writer or worse still I actually disagree with them - so why would I waste my time and effort in reading their book. Sadly it seems that there are more than their fair share of these books out there. But not with this one. Basically you have a scientists who not only knows what he is talking about but also how to present it in an accessible and fun manner he has also had experience on how to create displays and exhibits so he knows how to keep your attention.So what of the book then - well you have several layers to this book. The first is that of the story of him deciding to create his own collection of elements from periodic table, now some are incredibly easy to source others are near on impossible.But you also have historical stories of the elements. However rather than just dry stories of their discovery and who made them there are also side stories about how they were used or even how they became famous and had their 15minutes of fame (from St Pauls cathedral to Napoleons death).Each chapter and even each sub-section tells a fun and fascinating tale along the way while we watch the author try (and sometimes fail) to add another element to his collection.I will admit this was a total gamble although I am sure I recognised the title from somewhere - however I am very glad I did and I am sure I will be referring back to this book again in the future.

5,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8281679-andrew,2,"A disappointment. I picked this up thinking it might be weirdly informative and entertaining, like Bill Bryson's wonderfully entertaining science history ""A Short History of Nearly Everything."" But in the end I found almost all the anecdotes lifeless and pointless. Ultimately I gave up and put it back on the shelf about two-thirds through."
6,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9995834-celtria,4,"This book sits on my science shelves but it should inhabit a shelf of its own, labelled Biographies of the Inanimate (a section for Borges imaginary Library of Babel?).To quote the author: ""My aim in this book has been to show that the elements are all around us, both in the material sense that they are in the objects we treasure and under our kitchen sinks, but also around us more powerfully in a figurative sense, in our art and literature and language, in our history and geography, and that the character of these parallel lives arises ultimately from each element's universal and unvarying properties.""Aldersey-Williams reaches that aim in a well-written, easy-read, book of surprises that takes the reader from the trenches of WWI to the swimming baths, from the teacher's chalk to the dentist's chair, from limelight to Las Vegas and on many other adventures for which you don't need any previous knowledge of chemistry. Though you may find yourself tempted to acquire a poster of the Periodic Table to stick on your kitchen or bedroom wall!A warning: reading Periodic Tales may turn you into an irritation to the other reader on the sofa with your interjections into the silence, ""Listen to this..."" ""Did you know..."" ""I would never have thought...."" :)"
7,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26477322-bryan-nguyen,4,"Hugh Aldersey-Williams's Periodic Tales tells the story of the cultural history of the elements separated in five topics, the subjects of the book which are: power, the richness of the element or how valuable it is; fire, the changes of compounds when they react with other compounds like water; craft, the way people can manipulate the elements; beauty, the appearance of an element and how elements color our world, and earth, how an element affected a certain place or how the place affected an element. The book is set in from way back earlier than 1600 B.C.E. to 2011, when the book was published, at no particular place, but mostly in Europe, where many pure elements were discovered and where several elements were synthesized, because multiple scientists from different countries contributed in the world of science. Telling many stories about the elements, including his own, Aldersey-Williams researches information about the elements, conducts a few of his own experiments, and presents us many elements' histories. He speaks about the history of the elements and his past related to the them, interesting stories about elements that we use today like gold, silver, and mercury, which was used in movies for a certain special effect.A very memorable event for me was a short section called ""Pee is for Phosphorus."" After telling us a story of how a scientist used fifty liters of urine for an experiment to see if phosphorus is in our urine, Aldersey-Williams conducted a similar experiment with his old teacher, but with less than fifty liters for a quicker completion rate. He followed the same procedure with some modifications but can't seem to extract the phosphorus out. He then theorizes that phosphorus was extracted, but in very small amounts. This was memorable because of the experiment and the weird title of the section.Ultimately, the story of the history of the elements is a story of scientists, like Marie Curie, discovering new elements, updating Mendeleev's period table to the periodic table we know today, experimenting with elements to learn new things, and manipulating elements for our personal gains, like using arsenic either for medication or assassination. It all adds up to a tale of cultural history, a subject that our generation wouldn't be very interested in, but it does educates readers of the usefulness of everyday elements or elements we used to use in the past. Periodic Tales tells that story very descriptively, reminding us how often we take advantage of our everyday objects, and how little we know about them, like how do they work, who invented them, or what they are made of.I learned a lot of things thanks to this book. It is practically a science book for college students. I learned what explodes when reacted with water, what makes our streetlights glow, what makes an object a certain color, and what possibly killed Napoleon (undetermined if it was the actual cause of death). Also, I learned some chemistry terms. This book made me change what I read because I really want to read interesting facts now, either from the internet or from a book. I need to expand my horizon of what I read because someday, the information I gained could help me later in the future.Unfortunately, this book isn't one of those books that's like an emotional roller coaster ride. This book is somewhat monotone, but I felt amazed, confused, and bored while reading this. Of course, I had ""Whoa, really?"" moments when I read something very interesting, but I also had ""Huh?"" and ""Zzz"" moments because of the uninteresting facts or the complicated chemistry terms that I don't understand. Even though I had confused and bored moments, I enjoyed reading about a quarter to half of the book, but the rest gave me a headache like the after-effect of a sugar rush.Periodic Tales is a rather lengthy book that talks so much about the elements. This book has too much information for an average person, especially someone who doesn't understand chemistry that well. Generally, I would not recommend this book because it has so many facts, confusing segments, and requires some knowledge of chemistry. Although some of the information was interesting, most of the other information felt boring to me. I would recommend this book to people who wants to grow up to be some type of scientist, people who's great in science, or people who really want to learn more about the elements."
8,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069314,4,"An extremely enjoyable book. To date it’s the closest I’ve found to one of my absolute favorite childhood books, passed down to me, long since mislaid; the title and author of which I cannot remember. That book had a red cover. Inside there were the most marvelous stories of the discovery of (amongst others) the composition of air (Scheele, Cavandish, Lavoisier), the alkali-earth metals (Davy), and helium (Kirchoff & Bunsen) in our Sun. Mr Aldersey-Williams’ select bibliography now strongly and helpfully points me in the direction of I Nechaev’s 1942 book “Chemical Elements” (or rather of the translation from the Russian), as being my long-lost book.‘Periodic Tales’ adopts Nechaev’s central thesis; to describe the sheer human and technological excitement of the discovery of the chemical elements. Unsurprisingly, there is considerably more to say in 2011 than in 1942; and not only about the fleeting fascinating existences of the man-made transuranic elements; where physicists have gracelessly elbowed the chemists out of the party.  Mr Aldersey-Williams’ writes for an adult, or interested teenager, audience, whereas I was reading Nechaev whilst still in primary (age 6-11) education. ‘Periodic Tales’ is wider, deeper, and longer; dipping into literature, mining, cookery, war, oceanography, classical history, Christianity, art, materials science, architecture …. That is by no means a comprehensive list.I was aware of reading this book in a slightly detached manner, probably because much of the fact contained was not new to me. After I graduated in analytical chemistry I found rewarding work as a research scientist. Within the pages of this book I experienced the very same interest, excitement, and knowledge which first sparked my interest in chemistry (and associated sciences) all those years ago.  Therein too, lay my only disappointment. A very serious disappointment. Why, oh why have the illustrations been printed in low resolution black and white; and within the text too. OK, I do know why. It’s considerably cheaper to do that in preference to bound-in high resolution black and white images on high quality gloss paper. But by choosing to make such false economies the publisher has not only grave insulted the author’s fruitful work, but also every reader of this book. So 4 stars, not 5. With quality illustrations I would have bought a copy of this book; instead I borrowed a copy from my local public library. Returning to the author’s wonderful text; this is a book to read and savor at leisure, not in haste. I usually hate over-frequent picking up, reading, and putting a book down, but I think ‘Periodic Tales’ actually benefits from periodic pauses, so as to enable the brain to fully enjoy thinking through what has just been read, together with associated connections and ramifications. Like a box of good chocolates, this book is definitely best savored and long-lingered over.  Just keep the ‘phone number of a good independent travel agent to hand. I’d never before thought of ‘Element’ tourism (see pg 378 on) … but after nowt but a modicum of thought, I can clearly see the appeal."
9,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6466300-pranav-saxena,3,"This is one of those books that's hard to put under any specific genre, but something you pick up looking how fun and ingenious the premise is. Who would not want to re-classify elements! Like people maintaining travel maps and collecting fridge magnets to commemorate trips, the idea for the book stems from the author's urge to collect samples of elements (using the periodic table as a map) and as he goes through the journey, aim to ""understand"" each element looking at its discovery and what role and position they have acquired in the society. The idea is definitely interesting - Mendeleev's periodic table classifies elements based on their physical and chemical properties. Whilst this may suffice for more technical use, these elements interact and are construed in our common life very differently. And thus, is there any merit in studying elements together that have similar values (E.g. clubbing ""value"" metals such as gold, silver, platinum etc. together). The brilliance of the book, however, lies in the author's ability to showcase our anthropomorphism with these elements. For instance, iron for strength, Arsenic as an adjective for anything poisonous, platinum for anything rare and precious (think platinum jubilee, platinum membership etc.) and so on. The author talks about how these elements have evolved with the society and our needs (e.g. Aluminium was considered a precious and power metal based on Napolean's use of it, but with time has lowered in perceived value). Delving into these elements also allows the author to explore interesting correlations around the time and geography of these elements being discovered. All in all, the author does a good job of bringing to life these fundamental and ubiquitous, yet often ignored elements. The book does use a free-flowing style of writing which at times leaves the reader with the burden of deciphering the narrative thread, thus making it not-so-pleasant from a readability standpoint. Nonetheless, a recommended read for offering a refreshing perspective. "
10,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4635771-ryan-vaughan,3," In a past review I confessed that I was for the most part scientifically illiterate. I'm not sure how far this book went in curing that but I do know a bit more about the periodic table than I used to. I can name the elements designated as halogens ,fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine as well as a few of the noble gases ,xenon, radon, and krypton. I'm not sure if this really counts as scientific knowledge or just knowledge of scientific terms though.  While their chemical properties of the elements in the periodic table are important it is the cultural baggage these substances have accumulated that the author is most concerned with. This is particularly true when talking about the things we value and esteem. Gold and silver are not only objects of worth but symbols of it as well. Just ask the guy who gets the bronze medal. However there was a time when aluminum was so highly valued that the guests at Napoleon III's table were given cutlery made for it to eat with while the less favored were given silver or gold. All in all a very enjoyable book my only complaint was that the author's storytelling is hit and miss at best. The books saving grace is that the author's enthusiasm for his material really shines through."
11,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506568-julia,4,"Very interesting. This book definitely tells a different story about the elements than what I, with a chemistry background, usually got. It assigned genders to a lot of the metals and talked about the colors and smells and sounds of the elements and the effect those things had on the way society viewed them before we could define them by their atomic structure. I learned a lot, not just that British people pronounce a lot of the elements weirdly, not just aluminum. Favorite fact: UPPU, a club that you could only join if there was enough Plutonium in your system for it to be detectable in your urine. Favorite quote: ""Civilization, it is immediately apparent, is simply organized resistance to oxidation...The gas brings life, and in doing so, brings death closer."""
12,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20494551-tweedledum,5,"Periodic tales is one of those books that grabs you by the throat and will not let you go. Full of extra-ordinary stories, co-incidences, twists and turns Hugh Aldersley-Williams meanders through the arcane history of the elements and in so doing encourages the reader to want to find out more and more. I have always been jointly fascinated by chemistry and the extra-ordinary people behind the knowledge we so take for granted and on which our civilisation hangs. Many of the people involved in the elements recent history are, of course, well known and celebrated for their work, Curie, Davy, Mendeleev are three that instantly spring to mind. But many others are unsung, unrecognised by the world at large and often forgotten even within the scientific community. Who now knows the story of the genius behind the discoveries at Ytterby or is able to name even 2 of the seven elements that were discovered there or even locate Ytterby on a map? Unlike an encyclopaedia or a chemistry textbook Periodic tales reads more like a mystery story and I found myself keen to keep reading and eager to follow Hugh's trail. It is hard to think of a topic or theme that is not touched on somewhere in this book but everything is handled with a deft lightness of touch and great literary skill. The history of the elements is intimately entwined with the history of humanity and in taking us to the trenches and the use of Chlorine as a weapon he keeps our eyes firmly fixed on the patriotic chemist, Haber, who proposed that the gas be released from ground based cylinders allowing wind to carry it over to the enemy lines. Hugh follows the Haber story through telling of the suicide of Haber's wife (also a chemist) in 1915, following the attacks, and of his own visit to Haber's son and daughters who retired to Bath of all places. Hideous as this particular bit of history is Hugh dances his narrative along now showing the comic, now peeping into the ancient craft of sword making, now revealing the unsung hero. Any review of this book cannot begin to do it full justice. All I can say is Read it. You will not be disappointed and you will find that your view of the world has expanded exponentially. "
13,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2207574-andres,5,"If you enjoyed The Disappearing Spoon as much as I did, than this book is a no-brainer must-read.I remember while taking a chemistry class not too long ago that though the nitty gritty details were sometimes daunting, boring, or downright frustrating, it was always the stories about the elements or their discoverers that helped put everything in context, making it a richer learning experience. Seeing as how the history behind the elements wasn't the point of taking the chemistry class I sought out books that would help fill the gap.Now almost 2 years later there are two books that fit the bill (not to say that this book and this book are lacking anything, but the dictionary-style formats aren't quite as organic in presenting the information as are 'Spoon' and 'Tales').Both books are similar in style and cover the same elements (there are only a finite amount of them!) but do so in completely different and interesting ways. It might be due to the time between reading both books but I didn't notice any overlap in information or anecdotes. If something was familiar it was more like getting the other side of the story than a repeat of the same details.I recommend 'Tales' (and 'Spoon') to anyone interested in science, science history, or chemistry. I think reading one or both of these books will help demystify the elements and make learning chemistry that much easier."
14,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5286233-j-p,3,"It must be tough to write a book on science. Make it too simplistic and it may have wider appeal but the people most likely to buy it will think it stinks. Go gung-ho into the subject and in this case chemists will love it while it cures the insomnia of the general public. Ultimately, this book is a bit of both.I thought the background on elements could have been done better. The author leaves out some of the basics to sail off on tangents that aren't nearly as interesting. For instance with zinc, he never mentions the most common usage as plating for steel but goes on for pages trying to figure out why bars in France were originally called zincs. There was also too much time spent on oddball references, namely the use of certain elements in art and literature.That the author is way into his topic is proved by the line ""...we should all have a little piece of spent uranium to keep in the garden as a momento of our reliance upon it for our energy."" I'd rather opt for a gnome.And with all the colorful elements on the planet, all the tiny illustrations are in black and white.I liked it in certain respects, but not in others."
15,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23599573-lithezebra,2,"I should have taken ""cultural history"" more literally. This was not a science book, or even much of a science history book, and I came away feeling like I hadn't learned anything inspiring.. However, if you're more interested in how people have felt about precious and useful metals, without the details of physical science, it's a well written book."

It is through this cultural life rather than through experimental encounter in a laboratory that we really come to know the elements individually, and it is a cause for sadness that most chemistry teaching does so little to acknowledge this rich existence.
I am not a certified science teacher and have never wanted to be one. Yet here I am teaching Chemistry this semester: the 2nd worse class I ever took in school (physics being the first). Somehow I had to make chemistry accessible to my high school kids. And accessible to me. We can't do experiments because of lack of money and equipment (and I am learning that because of money and liability problems that fewer and fewer chemistry classes are experimenting). I re-read 
The Periodic Kingdom: A Journey Into The Land Of The Chemical Elements
 and became so fascinated with the elements that I now have a course of six books I want to read about them (including Oliver Sacks's 
Uncle Tungsten
). This, Periodic Tales, was the first of my six.I loved it. This book combines human culture and history with science: my favorite type of book. In combination with Gray's 
Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe
, I have thoroughly enjoyed myself reading, and collecting and tagging images on the iPad with Google image search (these can't be shared, unfortunately). Just as Aldersey-Williams says in the quotation above, I now am knowing these elements in their many dimensions; individually. If you, also, become obsessed with the elements, this is the place to start. Slowly, I am percolating different projects in my head so that the elements can be known individually by my students. Students with no background knowledge of science at all shouldn't be bored with it. They should know that they are a part of chemistry."
19,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8736735-graham,5,"A meandering personal scientific historic journey though the elements. I can understand why some folk found this hard going: the numerous diversions off to visit a shop, a mine, a lab, a library, a museum might distract from the central narrative of 'how the elements wee discovered' but actually ACTUALLY this is how science works. Something read or seen might spark the imagination which generates motivation in the midst of fruitless struggle..... Look, if you like to know 'totally useless' facts that might just ignite a bored teenager to take an interest in science, so they see that real people with real lives did real work over years to wrestle a substance out from its mineral which now allows their mobile phone to work, then this book is great. The inclusion of where the quotes came from, a huge bibliography and a fantastic index [with the elements in bold :) :) :) ] just adds value to this tome. The only disappointment was that this book was not produced by Dorling Kindersley. It would have doubled the length to nearly 900 pages but huge photographs in colour would have just been the icing on the panna cotta."
20,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6266157-alyson,4,"A really interesting and entertaining way to learn more about the elements, the periodic table, and the history surrounding them. As a non-chemist, I found the book really enjoyable and very informative. I learned more about the atomic structure of the elements, as well as their cultural influence. I did find that it was a little hard to keep up my pace during the second half. This could be due to the latter half of the book dealing with the slightly less interesting/influential of the elements, my own stamina running down after 200 pages, or the writer's own interest being less pronounced for those particular elements (he seemed kind of tired and ready to be done by the time we got to the rare earth elements. No matter, it was a great book and one that I recommend to people who like short snippets of history and cultural analysis. If you want more in depth analysis of the history of science/chemistry this is not the right book, but could still be used as a starting point for further studies. "
21,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084339-alana,3,"It took me a long while to read this, because while the individual stories were interesting, the book as a whole just wasn't engaging enough to keep me coming back to it. I finally finished it off by reading about one or two elements every day, enough that the facts and dates didn't start swimming together, and I think that worked better. The anecdotes about the history of each element were interesting, although if you asked me to summarize any of them for you I probably couldn't. I don't think I retained very much (maybe just that there's a mine in Sweden that I should check out) but who knows.Definitely have to be at least a LITTLE into science and/or history to like this one. "
22,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12456741-anne-marie-hodge,3,"Tons of interesting facts and trivia, and a unique approach to the cultural history of chemical elements. The reason I only gave it three stars is that the narrative sometimes gets a little too boggy for my taste and a bit repetitive (how many times do we need to be reminded that elements were distilled from ores in order to be discovered, much less have the process painted for us in detail?). I think it's worth the read, however, because it does contain a lot of history and insights into just how lab chemistry and physics have developed so many things that we take for granted in daily life."
23,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59592494-naila,5,"This book reveals so many details about the discovery of elements as well as cases in which such elements were used in crimes,etc. The book also revealed to me how several of the famous scientists/discoverers were acquainted with one another and that they would seek each other's opinions. Definitely a must read for anyone interested in chemistry."
24,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637605-arty,4,"Full of the sort of information that turns up on QI, this book showed up huge holes in my knowledge... and then filled them with interesting chemicals, some of which I'd never heard of before."
25,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727301-christopher-mocella,3,"(Reviewer's disclosure: I am a chemist) - This book is an off angle take on the chemical elements from a historical perspective (how they were discovered), but also deeply on a cultural and meaningful, even poetic, perspective. The author has really done his homework on this, and I learned and was enlightened to quite a bit. I can't say that I was enthralled, finding myself skipping some pages and trying to get to interesting chemical-history parts, but the book was interesting enough to read to the end.It's hard not to compare this book to The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean (which I personally enjoyed very much), but I think that they are very different takes on chemical elements, the stories of how we discovered them, but also what they mean as a society. The author will take the cultural, even spiritual, significance of elements when they were found, or how they were used, and try to paint a more poetic state of them than just hard science (there is very little hard science here).This line from the book sums up how the author treats his subject:""This monochrome was is deceptive, not truth-telling; it soaks everything in a nicotinic glare such that is is no longer possible to perceive color accurately."" Great line! He is talking about the yellow-orange wash of sodium vapor lamps, as opposed to the light given out by gas lamps, and how that affected what people saw (color and shadow) but also what the glow *meant* for poets and writers and people when they existed among these differently-lit cities.Lots of stories on discovery of elements, lots of stories on the history and use of elements along with what they meant in certain cultures, and quite a few ""pathos"" discussions of them as well. "
26,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34698270-david-meiklejohn,0,"Rating this book doesn't seem possible.On one side, the author uses humor, and wonderful writing to bring to life not just the elements on the periodic table, but the construction of the periodic table, and the labor needed to prove each element as it was found.On the other is a meandering text that verges on imperialist, at times sexist (why do metals need a sex assigned to them?) and certainly euro-centric that made me a bit uncomfortable. I think the best way to describe this book would be if Garrison Keillor and Ira Flatow ghost wrote a radio series for the BBC. It's in depth, indulgent, has beautiful turns of phrase, wondrous descriptions, then gets lost in itself from time to time, makes you learn, scream and frankly leaves you not sure how to feel. Would I recommend this book? Possibly, to certain people. A true love of science going in is needed. Being able to not discard the book as he debates if titanium is male or female for multiple pages could be helpful too. Other than that, the stories that come up are entertaining in equal parts inspiring and occasionally horrifying. "
27,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108351-anna-kaling,3,"Periodic Tales was interesting. It wasn't dry - possibly veered a little too far the other way, with the author reaching to relate the elements to art and literature, leading to some rather tortured analogies - but it wasn't dumbed down, either. I liked that it talked about the scientific properties of the elements but concentrated more on the context of their discovery and use, which I knew far less about. I listened to the audiobook and I'll have to listen again because I did find my attention wandering fairly frequently, but not because the book was boring. I think it was partly because the narrator had a really soothing voice and partly because the structure of the book was quite fuzzy and didn't make it too easy to follow. Instead of just going through the elements one by one he grouped them into 'cultural significance' groups like Beauty and Power. I understand his reasoning in the introduction, that other books have done what he did in a more usual structure, but it still seems obvious to me that in a book called Periodic Tales you would use the intrinsically elegant ordering of the periodic table to tell your story."
28,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75614199-lindsay,3,"I struggle with the rating for this book and I’d probably settle on 2.5. The biggest issue was the desperate need for a decent editor. Confusing organization, grammaticalproblems, and tangents that strayed too far plagued this book and created significant distractions. A good editor also may have cut out the useless sections on the author’s own experiments, which came off as rushed and odd. But despite all that, what made me rate this at 3 stars, is - Viva la Nerds! This author is in fullout nerd mode over elements,and he makes an excellent point in his epilogue. The scientists (particularly chemists) that made these contributions are almost entirely forgotten. And they shouldn’t be. Nerds are important for both the propulsion and perseverance of science. My eyes glazed over at times, but I learned things I didn’t know before, and that’s what matters."
29,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15167899-hilary-g,3,"A few weeks (or months) ago, there was a series on TV called ""Chemistry: A Volatile History"". At about the same period, I discovered a quiz on the Internet in which you had to name all the elements (112 of them) within 10 minutes, and was shocked at how few I knew (including NONE of the newer ones, many of which I had never even heard of). Together, these two things reawakened an old interest in science. I remember reading the biography of Marie Curie when I was quite young. I was interested in scientific discovery and astronomy, and would have loved to be a scientist, if only I had the brain for it (which I didn't and don't). I'm not really interested in the atomic weights, or the actual speed of light or the technology involved in making discoveries or getting to other planets. I'm more interested in the human beings that make the discoveries, the wonder and beauty of the discoveries themselves or the impact of them on humanity. I suppose this dichotomy between my interest in science and my ability to understand it technically was the impetus for my love of science fiction, a genre I devoured for decades and was often truly excited by. I don't read much any more as the genre seems to have degenerated into soppy fantasy which doesn't interest me much at all. Talking about my reawakened interest in the elements to a friend who has an MA in Chemistry from Oxford (I forget which college and it doesn't matter much), he recommended and lent me this book.On the face of it, this book was ideal for me because it is about the lives of the elements, their personalities and attitudes, talents and shortcomings (I got that from the back cover of the book), where elements fit into our culture, our history and literature, science and art. I thought this was an interesting way to look at elements and it was, I learnt many things I didn't know but there were several aspects of the book that irritated me somewhat. There are writers who seem to be able to turn their hand to anything and you can imagine a publisher saying to one of them, ""We need a book about the duck-billed platypus, can you do it?"" And this sort of writer can, and to make it seem like it is obvious he is the one the publisher should have gone to, he will claim a lifelong interest in duck-billed platypuses, dating from the day an aunt gave him a toy one when he was still in his pram. I remember once reading a book about the astronauts by a writer who claimed to have spaceships on his pyjamas when he was a tot. Hugh Aldersley-Williams struck me as one of these, with his boyhood collection of elements, though I was probably wrong as seemingly he actually trained as a chemist. I can't help thinking, though, that it isn't possible for anyone to be as knowledgeable as he appears. I can't rid myself of the impression that this book is the result of an army of researchers, and him just the front man. There is a sticker on the book saying ""As heard on Radio 4"" which reinforces this impression. Aldersley-Williams's role seems to have been wafting about the world to ""chemical"" locations. He seems to have visited an unbelievable number of places for just one book, no doubt at the taxpayers' expense, since this is the BBC.I looked at the Wikipedia entry on Hugh Aldersley-Williams, which is short and sparse, but in it, I saw that the Daily Telegraph described this book as lucid. I suppose it is, but I think it may not be that accessible to a lot of people. I think I have an above average vocabulary, but there were lots of words that I thought were obscure, and I don't mean scientific words. There is a certain aura of pomposity in the writing and verbiage for its own sake. This writer never says car when he can say automobile instead. The other thing that struck me about the writer was that the subject seemed to give free rein to artistic pretension. There are many descriptions of the meaning of works of art that I found laughable, such as the one about the dirty handkerchiefs that had belonged to famous people. Sometimes the language was out and out fun, though. I liked the description of the Airstream, with its ""buxom aluminium nakedness"", and the one about the Buick: ""The male characteristics formed in chrome find their female counterpart in the painted curves of the bodywork, making these designs into fully conceived hermaphroditic sex machines."" There is a certain dirty old man reek to this prose that I found hilarious. More puzzling were assertions such as it being long accepted that gold is masculine and silver feminine. Accepted by who? This was news to me.Since I am being a bit negative (sorry) I'll mention the pictures, which I thought added absolutely nothing. For one thing they were grainy black and white. I can't imagine who chose them, who decided that a picture of an aluminium teapot was more interesting than a picture of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, one of the most admired works of contemporary architecture with its curved sheets of titanium.I don't want to be too negative, though. I enjoyed reading the book and learnt a lot. I thought the idea of considering where the elements fit into our history, art, literature was an excellent one, and the breadth of coverage was pretty impressive. Even the slightly bombastic language and the arty pretension had a certain charm, though the writer is certainly no chemical Bill Bryson. Occasionally, I was moved by the obvious passion the writer has for his subject, such as his description of his excursion to a mine at Ytterby in Sweden, which illustrated the enormous contribution to the discovery of the elements (the rare earths) made by the Swedish. PS - as of today, I can name all 112 elements in less than 10 minutes!"
30,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52677162-grek-smith,3,"While there are lots of interesting facts and details about the known elements (how they were discovered, named or influenced the modern world), I found myself dizzied by the hopping between examples and names and dates and... it was just kind of all over the place. This is most of the reason for my several month pause in the middle of the book. So, I won’t remember a lot of what I read (spoiler: I already don’t) but it was nonetheless informative. If you plan to purchase it, try to plan to read discrete chapters/sections one at a time, and read/do something else in between. If you get it on loan from a library, try to not hurt your brain so much by doing a marathon with it. If you’re a chemistry or physical science teacher, use it more as an unabridged encyclopedia to pull from to teach interdisciplinary ideas about specific elements. "
31,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44576102-lisa-konet,2,"Don't know if I read an older edition or not because the title was somewhat different than the one I was supposed to read (oh well)... It was interesting to have a more in depth glance into each element. In each chapter a different element was discussed along with how it was named and why it was really named; along with any other poignant or funny stories.I didn't rate this higher because some of it was actual tedious/boring reading at times, but still something we should kind of know. I am going to try to find a better account of the history of the elements.Just ok."
32,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11292794-shane,3,"This book had a lot of interesting information in it and was really extensively researched. The issue for me came when reading all of these details in aggregate, where it felt like a list of unconnected facts. Which, honestly, you can't write about 100+ elements without jumping around, so I don't think the fault is in the book or the author. It just didn't work for me."

This work had a ton of research into the elements! The author's goal in the book was ""to suggest that we are familiar with many of the elements in a cultural way."" This led to many curious anecdotes. Such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" story was an allegory of The U.S. leaving the gold standard in favor of the greenbacks - the yellow brick road to the emerald city...Certainly there are more interesting facts flooding this book, but that was the only one that came directly to mind right now. Not a page turner, didn't keep me up at night reading, and well, sometimes it felt like the author was jumping around. I liked how he tried tracing the elements, playing with them, or replicating old experiments. Perhaps if the book format kept closer to that story it would be an improved book. Nevertheless, if anyone interested in chemistry or elements, it's a decent read."
37,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5346172-peter,4,"Had I not found this book on a train with a 'Read Me' sticker on it I would never have heard of it let alone read it and I would have missed out on an interesting read.Firstly I must admit that I never did much enjoy Chemistry at school in or for that matter science in general, I could never remember even the most basic of chemical formulae, and as such knew little about the Periodic Table other than seeing posters of it hung on classroom/bedroom walls. However, that said I have always been interested in History in whatever form. Initially I was somewhat worried that this would turn out to be a dull academic tome and while in places it did lose me a little and was a little dry, on the whole there was enough to keep me interested. In particular I loved the referances to modern culture/literature and even how obscure elements that I had never even heard of were often found right under our very noses within our houses. I loved the idea how gold historically has been seen as masculine and silver was seen as virginal and feminine. Where did the term 'platinum blonde' of the 40's and 50's come from? Was Napoleon Bonapart killed by his wallpaper? The author names the major discoverers of various elements but on the whole does not go into too much indepth history. For that reason some people will see it as too flighty and shallow where others will just find the whole subject matter too dull to persevere.But if you fancy a book that you can dip into a chapter or two at a time, picking up a few interesting snippets along the way with which to annoy/ fascinate your partner or mates down the pub, plus have a passing interest in both/either science and history then give it a go. Who knows you might actually learn something and that can be no bad thing."
38,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/683792-jen,3,"This book covered the task ""Read a nonfiction book about science""--because SCIENCE!!!As the daughter of a chemist, I should have a greater affinity for the elements--but I don't. Just as the preacher's kid goes running around town drinking, the chemist's kid doesn't know what a mole is and could care less about ions. However in my less rebellious adulthood, I find myself liking this stuff more and more and enjoying the science of it all. So an entire book about elements!!! WIN! Only...not so much.It's not that this book isn't good, because it is. It's just not the book I wanted it to be. It's the movie you see that is wonderful but you walk out saying ""but I really wanted to see a comedy."" Part of the issue is that it's organization is confusing--though it might be more reasonable if you knew something about the periodic table. I'm sure there was a method to the madness, I'm just not quite sure what it is and it was by no means obvious to the neophyte. Also, it was more like fun anecdotes about the elements and their discovery. It's what the introducer would say at the Oscar's if the element was winning a lifetime achievement award...""When I first met Polonium, it was a dark and dirty lab, and Marie, well she needed some coffee..."" The book took longer to read than I expected, because I kept going to wikipedia to get some basic knowledge about each element. Then I would get sucked down a wormhole and get back to the books 3 hours later, having somehow found myself going from Gallium to the Swedish monarchy. To be fair, everything is related to the Swedish monarchy.I feel that my itch to know more about the elements has not been scratched--only tickled. "
39,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10024577-holmes,3,"I appreciate the author's intent of showing the historical and cultural sides of chemical elements, but he could have been less long-winded. At times I had to skim-read because of the sheer volume of tedious details.Anyway it's worthwhile to quote a message of the author:We should cherish and celebrate our necessary involvement with the elements. We may not wish to start our own periodic table, but we should at least try to be happier about the unavoidable fact that we depend in one way or another upon almost all of them. The scientist and environmental activist James Lovelock once said he would be willing to store all the high-level waste from a nuclear power station in a concrete bunker on his land. But perhaps we should spread it around: we should all have a little piece of spent uranium to keep in the garden as a memento of our reliance upon it for our energy. Too much? Maybe. But what of all the other elements? The copper that invisibly brings the electricity generated by the nuclear reaction of that uranium into our homes? The rare earths in the phosphor screens of the devices brought to life by this electricity? What of the carbon and calcium that engrave all human history with their black and white? And what of the other elements that colour our world? First and last, our dependence on the elements is biological, as we are reminded when we review the sodium salt content of a TV dinner or pop a supplement pill containing selenium–the latest, by the way, in a long line of elements to be singled out as a fashionable nutrient. We eat them or avoid them, dig them up or bury them, but we rarely stop to appreciate the elements for what they are."
40,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25156813-amelia,3,"I read this because chemistry has always been my weakest subject and I would like to be less of a chem-idiot. This book is interesting and mostly very well written. It does contain a few odd errors, though, but probably none related to actual chemistry (Like I would know!). One of the themes the author includes is the description of how each element is named and the words from which that name derives. It's interesting stuff, but it also shows the author could research language details just a bit better. For example, the sun and the moon are not universally considered male and female, respectively, by every language and culture. He should really research such statements, especially right after referring to German in another sentence, as German is one of those languages in which the reverse is true.So, I learned lots about the elements, their cultural and historical importance, and many cool facts about their discovery and use. That was all good.I listened to this book on audible and the narrator was ok but clearly had some odd pronunciation quirks. He said, repeatedly, nuclear as ""nu-ku-ler."" To me this sounded very odd in light of his English accent. He also seemed to go to pains to pronounce some of the foreign words correctly, particularly the French words, but mangled several of the German and Swedish words, including the name of the great poet, Goethe. So, I found the narration a bit annoying some times, but fine the rest of the time."

What makes your lipstick that luscious red? You can find the answers to these and much more esoteric questions in Periodic Tales. Author Hugh Aldersey-Williams gives a terrific tour from aluminum to zinc, including why the British have an extra syllable in Aluminum. For those of us who had only a pathetic attempt at science in school,(namely me) he writes in a simple explanatory fashion, while still displaying playfulness and humor. This book is fun to read while still covering all the info an amateur would want or need to know. He hits the important people who discovered new elements, or who came heart-breakingly close and never knew it. He takes us to places where discoveries were made. He gives us the origins of names and explains why they were chosen. This book is like candy that is good for you. It makes you WANT TO KNOW all that stuff that lulled you to sleep in high school. He quotes John Keats, Buckminster Fuller and Tom Lehrer. Now that's eclectic! I really liked this, and I think almost any curious person would like it, too."

I found it really interesting, but written in an extremely dull and hard-to-follow sort of way.The author was British, which is fine, but he assumed I had a working knowledge of famous British chemists and, for example, referred regularly to what Davy had done or said previously. It took me several times of looking back to see if he had mentioned someone named Davy in the previous few pages (he had not) before I googled him. (Humphry Davy, Cornish chemist born 1778, discovered iodine and chlorine.) The writing was hard to follow and the author waxed too romantic at times (for my taste). For example, he was enraptured by the fact that some of the security features on the 5 Euro note are made from europium, and talked about it for like 5 pages.I found the section where he tries to isolate phosphorous from his own urine hilarious, but other than that, it was really dry and choppy."
43,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius,4,"I very much enjoyed this book. The beginning wasn't great, what with the statement on page 6 that the elements came into being a few moments after the big bang (they didn't - they began to be formed a long time later) and then a lengthy and slightly clunky section on gold, but it got better very quickly. Each element is treated in an eclectic and quirky section which may deal with its origins, its importance in human history, its odd properties, its influence in literature and so on, including a lot of amusing and interesting anecdotes.Badly done, this could be dreadful, but Hugh Aldersey-Williams handles it very well and the whole is highly entertaining and very informative. He is extremely erudite, he makes very wide-ranging and shrewd choices about what to include and above all is genuinely hugely enthusiastic about his subject. He also writes very well and I found myself keen to get back and read more, which is by no means always the case for me with this sort of book. It's an excellent read and I recommend it very warmly."

It's not dry and boring like a chemistry textbook, nor does it drone on like a nuclear physics book. Instead, it tells the story of the who and what lead to the discovery of the elements. In fact, it makes chemistry and history so nicely tied together that I'm going to use this as a source book for teaching. What makes it nice?Well, it isn't broken up by the periodic table. Instead, Aldersey-Williams breaks up the elements by form and function, giving you an insight as to modern usage as well as historical significance. Sure, gold and silver are top dog, but that's because we treated them as such as human beings throughout our culture. It's only fitting that they should fall into such neat categories here. I could go on, but I've got a course to write. :3"

There are some photographs, but they're mostly rather bad, and poorly reproduced to boot.In addition to being an enjoyable and instructive read, this book has also proved to be a great source of questions for the weekly pub-quiz club of which I am a member. Which small village in northern Europe gave its name to no less than four metallic elements? How come Phosphurus and Hesperus are both the same, yet different? What element, not especially common in daily life, is so ubiquitous in literature that Flaubert said it is 'everywhere'? What is the meaning of 'oxygen'?Highly recommended."

The book covers the birth of chemistry from alchemy, the class and national conflicts that arose from the discovery of elements, the cultural uses and weight we have ascribed to ""precious metals"", the development of environmental regulations. There's poison and beauty and industry and adventure, biographies and physics and history and chemistry. Fantastically interesting and well written. "
47,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249878-starhen,3,"Periodic Tales is a mixed bag: the stories which snagged my attention brought in information from other disciplines and touched upon the elements' relationship to cultural icons or themes. The brief elevation of aluminum at the court of Napoleon III, for instance, or the literary fame of thallium proved much more interesting to me than, say, the discovery of the rare earths. Some of the periodic tales are dull, yes, but fortunately the book moves along quickly. That's also its potential weakness, however, as no topic is explored in great depth."
48,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22559762-dave,3,"To call this a book of science is a bit misleading. Yes, it deals with the basic chemical elements' discovery and properties, but it truly is, as the subtitle describes, a cultural history of the elements. How did they infiltrate popular culture, whether in person as jewelry, art and objects of everyday life, or in literature and drama. My only complaint is that the book ran on a little long, but was quite fascinating for the most part. And who knew that Sweden was such a hot spot of elemental discovery?"

57,0670918113,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"A fascinating but not quite arresting compendium of element-related facts.Periodic Tales highlights one of the cardinal problems of reading for knowledge. The simple fact of the matter is that people who like to read widely will probably forget most of what they read, unless they are singularly invested in the subject matter (i.e. “geeks”) or have some form of eidetic memory (which, in any case, is supposed to be one of those medical myths).Periodic Tales is a book about the elements of the periodic table for the general public, written by such a geek. Hugh Aldersey-Williams admits an endless fascination with the elements, and is possessed of a collector’s instinct – both for the physical elements themselves, as well as the crust of historical and literary associations that are deposited around them during the decades, centuries and millennia of their use.The book comprises many short chapters, each of which is either about one element or a group of elements. Aldersey-Williams explores the ways in which human cultures have interacted with the elements and their various compound forms. A common theme that runs through each elemental portrait is that elements gain certain cultural connotations that arise out of their physical, chemical, and teleological properties. These connotations become enshrined in cultural and literary traditions. Gold and silver, for example, have long been associated in Western culture with the masculine and the feminine respectively, the metals of the sun and the moon. Silver, in particular, is associated with virginal purity; it shines with a smooth blue sheen in its pure form but turns to black as it tarnishes – a metaphor for the corruptibility of human nature. Some connotations transcend culture and become near universal – iron is always the metal connoting strength and hardness, for example, and its rust runs red as the blood it has spilled. It's a meme that has made endless forays into literature and pop culture to the extent that it has become folkloric in its ubiquity. Aldersey-Williams performs this analysis, as it were, on many of the elements with which humanity has had the most sustained contact.Aldersey-Williams also celebrates the historical context in which other, newer elements were discovered - and of their discoverers, whether chemists who isolated the elements in their labs, the mineralogists who found their naturally-occurring compounds in the wild, or the physicists who synthesized them with atom bombardment. Discovering an element must have been one of the most sublime scientific experiences back when the periodic table was largely unfilled - the frenetic activity of lone chemists in their labs and the feeling of ecstasy at finding an element that no one had ever known of before. It is an experience not easily recaptured in these latter days of science by committee, in which discoveries are really just filling in the expected empty spaces of the periodic table. But perhaps the spark of wonderment still exists with the potential that some new element will not fit the periodic table, and therefore revolutionize chemistry.Aldersey-William's prose glows with genteel enthusiasm about the subject matter. Although the informational flow can get dauntingly large, with so many elements to talk about, the book serves, at the macro level, to instill the understanding of just how deep the relationship is between humankind and the elements - in terms of their use, history, and aesthetic and cultural connotations. But you do feel a little bit ""elemented out"" after it all.Some Interesting Elemental Facts from the Book:1. The rare earth metals are not so rare, but many of them were discovered in one place - Uppsala, Sweden, whose unique geological surroundings and nose-to-the-grindstone approach to chemistry gave such people as Carl Mosander the patience to isolate, in painstaking fashion, these hard-to-separate elements. In particular, the village of Ytterby gave the world 7 new elements: and in one spectacularly unoriginal act of nomenclature, 4 rare earths are named after this town: yttrium, terbium, erbium, and ytterbium.2. Aluminum, the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, was once so valuable that Napoleon III gave aluminum utensils to his most honored guests during his banquets (where others would only get gold or silver), and aluminum tops the Washington Monument. It was valuable only because it was hard to synthesize before the invention of electrolytic techniques to liberate aluminum from its ore.3. One possible explanation for Napoleon's death on St. Helena is arsenic - but not because he was assassinated, a popular conspiracy theory, but because the humidity on the island made the wallpaper, which had arsenic-based pigments in it that could turn to gas under the right conditions. Or it could've been dysentery. Who knows.4.The cheap shine of our chromium-plated taps and household implements was one defining symbol of gilded-age America and Art Deco style, as seen in the prominent fins of a Buick or Cadillac of the era. Now chrome is as banal as they come, but still has that faint sheen of middle-class aspiration.5. Fittingly, europium is used to create special inks used on Euro banknotes to prevent counterfeiting. The author is unsure if this was a deliberate decision.6. The sickly yellow light at some streetlamps is due to the sodium used in them, which shines at one wavelength, and has been used in film and literature to characterize noir and urban decay.7. Radium, that radioactive element discovered by Marie Curie, used to be causally incorporated into all sorts of daily products - like toothpaste, in the belief that it had therapeutic powers.I give this book: 4 out of 5 bunsen burners"
