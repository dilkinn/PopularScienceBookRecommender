It's filled with so many examples from so many industries that I can't even remember them all; from medicine, aviation, Unilever detergent nozzles, DreamWorks movies, law enforcement, vacuum cleaners, and even child welfare social workers.The book tackles a number of important aspects of failure, such as the idea of complexity and how the world we live in is an immensely complex place making it difficult if not impossible to account for all variations and/or conditions. In order for the human brain to understand this complexity, we all use the narrative fallacy to simplify things so we can better understand. Another aspect of the situation is the need for marginal gains through repetitive testing, much like the evolutionary process. Marginal gains occur through bottom-up testing, as opposed to top-down analysis and planning which is what many of us do. We look at a problem, think about it, arrive at a logical solution, then apply the solution only to find it doesn't work for some unplanned for reason or due to complexity that we don't understand. Iterative testing instead will yield marginal gains with each iteration until the desired result is reached.Blame is another very important aspect of failure. Professional athletes don't look back on years of practice as a string of failures. Practice is what drives improvement. In all things. When blame is assigned, it undermines openness and learning in a field. However, when the professional has an internal fear of failure (either due to the corporate climate where blame is assigned or whether it is tied to the ego due to years of experience or education), we sometimes can't even admit our mistakes to ourselves.One of the most helpful ideas I discovered in this book is the idea of the pre-mortem. Prior to beginning a major project, assemble everyone together and assume the project has run its course and is now a huge embarrassing failure. What are some ways we could have prevented this outcome? How did the failure come about? And my favorite tongue-in-cheek list in the entire book: The 6 phases of a project1. Enthusiasm2. Disillusionment3. Panic4. Search for the guilty5. Punishment of the innocent6. Rewards for the uninvolvedYup, that about sums it up."

What if the problem is that no one has taught us how to deal with failure? This brilliant book reveals a framework for how to use mistakes as learning tools and transform short-term failures into long-term success. The book is full of engaging stories and interesting anecdotes on how the human psyche has the potential to deal with failure in a variety of ways. For me, one of the most interesting parts was the one on how the ego has the potential to make us completely oblivious to life-threatening mistakes happening right in front of our eyes. Becoming a ""Black box thinker"" will undoubtedly make you more successful in life. Overall, Matthew has nailed it once again! His previous book Bounce is one of my personal favorite personal development books. And as for Black Box Thinking, I highly recommend the book as it will give you powerful tools to deal with mistakes and make you a lot more aware of what's going in your mind and the minds of people around you in high-pressure situations."

How do we deal with it, and learn from it? How do we react when something has gone wrong, whether because of a slip, a lapse, an error of commission or omission, or a collective failure…? …The purpose of this book is to offer a radically different perspective. It will argue that we need to redefine our relationship with failure, as individuals, as organizations, and as societies. This is the most important step on the road to a high-performance revolution: increasing the speed of development in human activity and transforming those areas that have been left behind. Only by redefining failure will we unleash progress, creativity, and resilience.”~ Matthew Syed from Black Box ThinkingFailure.Some of us lean into it and learn as much as we can from it, and some of us prefer to avoid thinking about it and/or pretend it never happened. As you may guess, one approach leads to dramatically better performance over the long run. (Hint: Seeing failure as feedback + learning opportunities is a very wise idea.)This book is all about, as the sub-title suggests, “Why Most People Never Learn from Their Mistakes—But Some Do.”It’s a fascinating read. Matthew is a brilliant, award-winning writer who brings the wisdom to life via great story telling. (To put it in perspective, I read this and his other book Bounce in < 72 hours—Black Box on a Friday + a little bit of Saturday and Bounce on Sunday.)The book is geared more toward high-level concepts and organizational applications than individual self-help per se, but it’s packed with Big Ideas:1. Black Box Thinking - What is it?2. 50 lbs for an A vs. Perfect piece of pottery.3. Marginal Gains --> Extraordinary gains.4. 2,003 + 50,000 = Beckham’s magic formula.5.

You're willing to know that what's next and you are amazed how much it relates to you. This Book is one such book. The book is powerful enough to change the way you think of failure.We all know that we should be learning from our failures but hardly it happens that we apply the learning.This book explains with compelling stories that how we can learn from our failures and how is our life totally dependent on it.Favorite Quote-“Learn from the mistakes of others. You can’t live long enough to make them all yourself.” What's the best part about the book?The structure of the book along with short stories is an absolute delightFew actionable pointers from the book:-1.Create a system from failures- You're going to fail and you are going to fail n a lot of things. But have a mindset of applying the lessons you learnt from failing to avoid the same failures again. It works on the principle Black box is used for in an Airplane. So that the same error is not repeated again.2.Cognitive Dissonance- You can be your worst enemy if you're busy hiding your mistakes in your closet with a fear of shame. PLEASE accept your mistakes, stop hiding them, stop blaming others, that's the only way you can improve and grow.3.The Beckhem effect:- We all know how great player David Beckhem was. He was shamed once early in his career, but despite of letting himself down from it he used his will power to overcome it. Always accept your failures and grow out of your ego to contribute for self growth. Be Beckhem.Who is this book for?It's for everyone Because we all will fail at some point or the other."
5,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50820377-sonny-recio,3,"Black box thinking starts by storytelling the undeniable mistakes in the healthcare sector, particularly with the case of Elaine Bromiley's. It appears that healthcare industry was not open to mistakes that are happening inside especially if the case was life-threatening because the whole industry encourages 0% mistakes since they're dealing with life itself. Any mistakes made will be costly and unforgivable. With this, the author clearly stated that mistakes are essential and responsible for the direct improvement, and I have no qualms for that. He goes on with other stories like unjust justice system which blames an innocent suspect, discovery of dropbox through failures and flaws of the business model of other companies, and so forth.As I read this book, I also learned something that is related to our thinking biases, namely ""cognitive bias"" which affects the way we interpret failures which I haven't realized till then since we recreate or reframe the way we view failures which I will admit to myself as well.It was good that the author did some further emphasis as why we really have to embrace failures and how to learn from it 100% of the time to minimize redundant failures along the way. In fact, I bought this book just for the very same reason to optimize my learnings when I fail. But it would have been made shorter. At some point, I got bored in lengthy history recaps that emphasize failure in the past. But what I like most about this book is the later part where he emphasized that failures or mistakes are a way of improving one's own creativity. At some point, it can lead us to create or innovate things, which I thought it's something I lack(creativity). I've been passionate in doing something creative for a long time, be it an art, a creative web design of the sorts. I didn't comprehend that failures are part of making your creation or creativity flourish and is applicable for creativity as well. That's where I appreciate this book for the better.Overall, what was explained in this book is self-explanatory and can be realized with common sense as failure is really a way for us to learn. We all know that. Or maybe I just read lots of self-help books that I wasn't able to pick up lots of things from this book. But this is not to say this book is bad or unreadable at all. For beginners, you can learn a lot from this book. But for like me who reads a lot of self-help books and blogs every day, I think I only learn a little bit from this. But I'm still grateful I read this."
6,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6945307-damaskcat,5,"I found this a totally fascinating and thought provoking read. It looks at a subject which we tend to try and avoid in the twenty first century - failure. The culture is to cover up failures and not talk about them or even think about them. The author uses examples from the airline industry, medicine, inventions and many other backgrounds - including the industrial revolution - to illustrate failures which can be very useful and instructive.If you have had recent experience of a medical situation where mistakes were made then maybe this book should come with a warning as you could find some of the situations described uncomfortable. I almost gave up on the book in the first chapter because it reminded me of a personal experience but I persevered through that first chapter and found myself completely absorbed in the book.Airlines and aviation generally has learned from its failures which is one of the main reasons why air travel is so safe. Failures are studied closely to try and establish ways of preventing them. People are encouraged to report failures so that situations can be addressed. The author explores failures in medicine which could have lead to constructive changes and opportunities for people to examine their behaviour . In medicine consultants are regarded as God and rarely challenged but to avoid problems medicine needs to change its culture so that failures are examined so that future failures can be prevented.The author quotes some interesting examples from industry where a culture of reporting failures results in a much more relaxed and creative working environment when compared with an environment where failures are punished. He also quotes James Dyson and his thousands of prototypes for the original bag-less vacuum cleaner. The point being that you don't just invest something new - you have to make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of failures before you finally arrive at the finished product.The idea that failure is part of life and you need failures in order to learn is an interesting one and it made me wonder if schools which don't allow people to fail aren't doing their students any favours. Failures and mistakes are part of life and need to be treated constructively."

Thank goodness for him.Black Box Thinking is a book about failure, and how far, far too many aspects of our lives take exactly the wrong approach to it. His central argument is that nothing is more central to personal, systemic and societal progress than an open, honest and healthy approach to failure. Researched and supported by an exhaustive list of examples, the book was a pleasure to read, and I hope that I can take its lessons forward into my own life."
10,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57152441-sebastiaan,5,This book provided me with more useful information than my college education. 
11,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46643041-samson-sunny,2,In this book author says we have to give more importance to failures. We need to track the failure and note why and how we failed. This information will help us to improve the future steps that we are taking. Failing information is very important. All the innovation comes from many failures all successful people failed many times. It is not they are talented. They practised well and they took serious about their failure and they learnt from it. This book giving so many examples that reduces the concentration. Author gave different different title but all titles having similar contents. If the book is shorter it would be very good. It is difficult to read all complete chapters. I just skimmed the content. Middle half of the book is very boring. But anyhow the point is very clear. Learn from mistakes instead of sitting ideal and not doing anything.

13,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7902804-oliver-clarke,5,"I’ve read a few books like this lately, partly because there is a crossover with my day job, but mostly because I like ideas. This was definitely the best. It’s an extremely well written and engrossing examination of a simple concept, that failure is valuable because it helps us get better. Unlike some other similar books it never felt like it outlived it’s welcome. The examples used to illustrate the point were well chosen and often grippingly relayed. I was surprised at what a page turner ‘Black Box Thinking’ could be, and also that it moved me deeply at times. In summary then, this is intellectually stimulating, great fun to read and full of insight. I loved it."

16,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44562174-myles-cowper-coles,5,A very compelling read on why failure is crucial for progress. Syed manages to convey his points with great anecdotes and really brings to life what could be quite a dry subject. Highly recommended.
17,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26241624-temuujin-nyamdavaa,5,"Black Box Thinking is an unique book about failure as well as how to make use of mistake to bounce back from adversity. Matthew Syed, who also wrote another bestseller Bounce, which I haven’t yet read, offered us totally different view of failure and success with his work. To be honest, before reading this book, I reckon that failure is uncomfortable situation that should be avoided. But, now I have a totally different insight into it. The book starts with a totally new perspective about failure. To make it clearer, the author tours readers through the process of two most responsible industries in the world and how they both react when it comes to failure. Both are considered as significant and responsible fields because they both deal with human life. Though both are assumed as responsible due to such aforementioned thing, totally different results are presented. In health care, failure and its misconceptions are everywhere following cover-ups. For individuals in healthcare, talent is favoured. In aviation, failure is now rare and seen as a learning opportunity. People in aviation think that talent is not enough and favours persistent. The author tries to re-formulate a conception of failure based on the two different perception of error in aviation and healthcare throughout book. It seems to me that the author successfully tells us that the combination of right mindset of failure and right system for turning failure into success is the secret of high performance. Before this book, I read another book titled Mindset: The New Psychology of Success written by Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University. The book also deals with the conception of failure and argues that growth mindset plays in important, perhaps the most important role, in individual’s development. Black Box Thinking also continues to stick with this argument and defend the importance of failure. Personally, I can’t tell that Matthew Syed and Carol Dweck are both right at this moment. But, circumstances and experiences I have had recently seems to confirms its validity. Having an example of profession is also down-to-earth to me, as a reader. It undoubtedly gives me a moment to reflect my own belief having to do with mistake as well as related to my profession. One particular thing I learned as well as experienced after reading this book is that testing our assumptions, seeing their flaws and learning from them. In chapter 3, the strangest thing about success is that it is built upon failure. When confronting the moment of failure, as the part 2 of this book tells, we tend to pose symptoms of denial, convictions, and blame. Instead, we should test first and have an expectation to learn from it. We sometimes carry the fallacy of perfectionism and fear failure when attempting something new. But, providing we have a bottom to up approach, it is possible to learn from the fall and come up with solutions to problems. Another interesting topic concerned success is the notion of marginal gains in chapter 9. Sir David Brailsford, who started the dominance of British cycling after he became a general manager of his country’s team, became an exemplar of how marginal gain can have big impact in high performance rather than sole big defining change. Small changes in every area of our life doesn’t make a difference at a time, however, add over the long term. Everything related to our certain goal could improve by only 1 percent, then those small gains would add up to remarkable achievement. With deep analysis of failure and success as well as some insightful and practical systems towards success, Matthew Syed managed to convey his secrets weapons towards success in life. "
18,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15827252-an-te,5,"This is a compelling book. It is assumed in this book that errors just occur and are a natural part of life and its concomitant complexities. Its main thrust concerns the articulation of two different cultures in dealing with this complexity. The first is the shut down of all inquiry and learning through pre-emptive blame. The second is the just culture of thorough investigations into the underlying factors that have contributed to the error that established a learning culture and growth mindset that responds to negative experiences with an attitude willing to learn and adapt accordingly. The justice systems, systems engineering, aviation, healthcare and the personal approaches to learning of prominent sportspeople and software start-ups are drawn on making this book engaging for a general readership. My personal interest for reading this book has been, primarily, for the healthcare component. I have been moved to explore the area of human factors, ergonomics and organisational culture which is of pertinence to my early career research. I am very glad I have read this book as it has enabled me to understand some of the shifts in attitudes and values that are needed in the healthcare industry. I have an understanding of the theory. It's quite another thing changing the culture. I am certainly and less concerned about the direction in which healthcare now needs to move. And so with this clarity attained, I would like to resolutely affirm and recommend this book to a general readership and to those interested in organisational culture, innovation and learning."
19,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52168711-lamarr-d,5,"""Black Box Thinking"" is phenomenal! It forces you to think deeply about the decisions you have made personally and professionally – and more importantly, the failures as a result of those decisions. No matter if you are an employee or an entrepreneur, the book also compels you to think about how your company makes its decisions and how things can be improved in your work environment. The way we have been conditioned and taught to view failure is wrong and, in Syed’s view, we should embrace failure as an opportunity to improve versus using failure to blame someone. Going forward, this perspective will be something I use in all areas of my life. That sounds simple, but this book illustrates how powerful a simple change in thinking can produce extraordinary outcomes, both good and bad. “Black Box Thinking” should be required reading for anyone seeking to grow personally and professionally. The author did a great job of weaving historical examples from the aviation, healthcare, and sports industries to support each point made throughout the book. An excellent feature! It was a perfect read and I will be reading it again in the future, for sure."

I will admit - that is what I came into the book expecting.What I got was SO much more. Riddled with real life stories, examples and scientific evidence this book really breaks down the psychological issues and games we play not only as individuals but as organizations to avoid, deny and even penalize failure and how much it hurts us to do so.I love the real world examples and stories and it was fun to learn about the grit some people have had that have led them to the success they have achieved like David Beckham and James Dyson.I’m left with 3 big takeaways:1. Don’t just avoid failure. Embrace it. Use it as a tool to improve your skills, mindset and life.2. Avoid hospitals as much as possible (unless you live in Seattle as I do and can go to Virginia Mason 😂🙈)3. Go buy a Dyson vacuum cleaner ASAP. 🤪"

It’s a very well weighted consideration of why we take failure at face value as a bad thing, and sometimes even ignore it, out of a need to delude ourselves into thinking that we are as good as we think we are. Syed argues that acknowledging failure is the right way to go; after all, even with the cleverest people on the planet, every possibility can not be anticipated - so failures are inevitable. The optimum strategy is to be as pragmatic as possible with failures, like in aviation, where failures are published so the community can collectively learn from them.Nearly every field can learn from this approach, after all, it does offer some impressive returns, as seen in so many different contexts, from hospitals which adopted the approach, to maximising success in business."

How medicine is taught to be an exact subject, but a lot of it is a result of experiments that can improve. We can improve healthcare, if only we position it as a learning system and remove the stigma and blame associated with failure.The insights in the book do fade a little as you progress. I was looking for concrete methods to improve and rather found evidence being piled upon for the same message again and again. The message though is compelling enough to start a movement about, especially in Medicine.Overall a great read, and you will finish it quickly too!"

29,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61486263-alberto,4,"The book enlightens the reader about how different industries deal with failure and mistakes. It provides the reader with lots of insights, examples and evidence why some people indeed never learn from their mistakes. Everyone of us makes mistakes, every day, but what's most important is how you deal with your mistakes. If you're prone to understand what went wrong and how, and look for a solution or improvement, you'll teach yourself a meaningful lesson. Otherwise, what will happen is that you'll try to reframe the truth, cover up and look for excuses, more often blaming something or someone else, and this is what happens, for example, in health care and justice.Thanks to this book, I've come to know what an RCT is, how we, as humans, think when we face an error, what cognitive dissonance is, how the blame culture is so deep into our society and how this refrains us from learning from what we did wrong.The book, although it mainly focuses on ""black box thinking"", gives some real life examples, like Dyson and Beckham, about their successes and failures, highlighting that people like them practised a lot, failed a lot and gained a lot learning from their failures, because failures can also lead us to new solutions and new ideas.I've always been taught what without sacrifices and resilience you won't go anywhere, so nothing new to me here, but it's anyway something important to keep in mind, because there're so many examples in real life that could make you think that success is immediate, that without talent you won't succeed and stupid things like that.I think it's important to mention that this book will make you think about failure and mistakes in a different way.The writing style is simple and the author always tries to involve the reader in the discussion. The chapters are neither too short nor too long, in order to keep the reader focused without losing interest.I highly recommend this book."

That said, I found this book very stimulating in that it proffered me the opportunity to creatively intuit many ideas that I could potentially utilise in my work as a teacher. I think if this was your first experience of the concepts discussed, it would be perceived as an impressive deconstruction of our socially incapacitating narrative: that failure is disastrous. However I have read, learnt and watched much on this topic, and the psychology behind it, and so this felt more like I was adding a string to my conceptual bow, so that I could launch my arrow of opinion just that little bit straighter. I think this is why I found it slightly repetitive as Syed tried to stich the narrative by darning where I didn’t perceive any holes to be; the concepts were already pretty solid in my mind. I did enjoy that a lot of his examples where British as it felt just that bit closer to reality and I found his description of the nozzle problem at Unilever, the creation of DropBox and the development of cyclone technology by Dyson inspirational. Syed explains the reason why in emergent situations we hyper focus on the micro elements of a situation often neglecting the full picture to disastrous consequences; we black box think. He discusses that success is only due to the reflection on failure, the incessant drive to try again in an empirical fashion and the social environment of a free market, critique and feedback. Ultimately this book leaves you with the message that we can all be successful but it takes a lot hard work, failure and reflection to get there."
31,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12300407-vaidas,5," I learned how errors are differently handled in aviation and healthcare and what outcomes are. Ones try to embrace mistakes and tries to learn from to prevent it in the future, others try to cover up it of the fear or attitude towards errors. I liked the examples of marginal gains and randomized controlled trials. ""if you break down a big goal into small parts, and then improve on each of them, you will deliver a huge increase when you put them all together"". Great, inspiring stories about formula one, Goggle, or student winning at the eating championship. Everything comes done to make experiments, look what's working and not, and have a control group.  I heard term pre mortem first time. Pre mortem - thinking ideas why you might fail. And try to anticipate and prevent it at first. All in all, excellent book."
32,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41313281-rachael,2,"This book is about how we can learn from failure and improve. It’s a shame that this book didn’t use that principal. It could have been shorter, more focused and less repetitive. It was extremely male centric and used almost exclusively male examples. It didn’t look at male ego as a barrier to admitting failure but when mentioning “surgeons” I didn’t get the feeling that included women. There was lots of moaning about doctors not learning from mistakes which is a shame as it propagates a singular, misinformed viewpoint. It does have some merit in bringing up examples of success built on failure that were less familiar but it was overly detailed. I didn’t need to know every free kick that David Beckham scored in a major tournament. In a nutshell, about 5 or 6 useful pointers but hard work to get to them. "
33,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23137241-mengyi,5,"I initially was interested in the book because I thought the “black box” is what the term means in electrical engineering, it turns out that it refers to the black box in airplanes.Nonetheless, this is one of my favourite books I read this year. Although the topic seems very corny - it’s important to learn from failures, but the author is able to dissect this argument from so many angles all with case studies narrated in a really intriguing way. A lot of times I felt it was as a page turner as a fiction.I am especially fond of the chapter on randomised control trial. It just opened my eyes about why sometimes data alone without context can be misleading.Really enjoy this book! Highly recommended!"

Instead, it’s an analogy to the aviation sector, where black boxes are used to learn and improve the flight processes.Read the full review at my blog."

Strong concept, but the narrative gets derailed midway and some examples seem force fitted. The author ends up doing exactly what he warns the readers against- oversimplifying life and rationalizing the results in hindsight."
36,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5062318-jfp,5,I loved this book. It compares the culture in aviation to healthcare in terms of their ability and willingness to learn from failure. It made me think hard about the culture in banking - especially in the light of all the regulatory reforms. Have we created a closed loop system there? Read it and let me know....
37,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7234018-travis-bow,4,"A really interesting book. Kind of standard for this type of book; stories that run through each chapter with analysis and studies sprinkled throughout each chapter. The main points - that iterative learning from our mistakes is super valuable and that we ignore it a lot and psychologically block ourselves from learning from our mistakes (trying to shape the world to our perceptions instead of the other way around) - are pretty solid. The only fly in the ointment is that the author makes some sweeping claims at the end about how religion has been the main thing blocking us from learning from our mistakes in the past... all of which are ""top down"" rather than ""bottom up"" and not backed up very thoroughly. A book I might read again someday to try to internalize the lessons a little more."

The expertise we have developed is crucial for all of us. But when we are trying to solve new problems we need to reach beyond our current expertise. We do not want to know how to apply the rules; we want to break the rules. We do that by failing - and learning”
39,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35714446-murali-dharan,4,"Another nicely written book by Matthew Syed. The author draws parallels between those industries that learn from their failures and those who don't. Numerous real life case case studies and examples are given to easily to explain the benefits of retrospection, learning from mistakes and having a growth mindset to be successful. The term ""cognitive dissonance"" was new to me and I was able to reflect on this myself from various experiences I have had."
40,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Black Box Thinking is based on the simple premise that some people (and some industries) learn from their mistakes, while others don't. Flying is widely considered the safest form of travel – but this is only because the industry obsessively seeks to improve their processes by analysing black boxes after incidents and promptly rolling out any necessary changes, without playing the blame game.The main contrasting example is medicine – Syed details how well-meaning (and incredibly competent) medical professionals inhibit their improvement loop at the risk of their patients and how structural changes can improve this. This book was recommended to me by a senior investment professional, and I can see why. Even the best investors in the world have a success rate of only ~60%, so it is incredibly important for them to have the right attitude to failure. Black Box Thinking is written very well and reads easily – I got a lot of value out of it and would wholeheartedly recommend the book to anyone who wants to succeed in their chosen field."

Our brain is by construction wired to see simplicity out of the complex world, if all is simple making mistakes originate from a negligence and the solution is being harch : blaming & escape goat & killing the messenger.Matthew tells a lot of emouvant thriller story, most of time of people being killed and mistakes can be avoided by acknowledging and tweaking the environment.Matthew compare different culture and their response to mistakes : healthcare, juridic system, aviation, science, researches.Same quotes and idea from the books : Medical errors: like having 11/9 every 2 month, Or two jumbo crash jet every 24h.33k per killed year in uk Learn from the mistakes of others, you can't live long to make all of them.If you focus on a task time you will fill time pass faster by 40%20 people have died on the crash but 10k where saved by learning from the crash Pilot have full immunity if they fire an issue report in 10 dayFailure show us that the world is different from what we think is, so we need to update our models It's better 10 guilty got except that one indecent suffering.When DNA found, 50% victims were exonerated innocent. Cognitive Dissonance : when we hit something challenge our beliefs => We reframe : new reason, new justification, denial ( exemple Iraq WMD for Tony Blair ).The more you invest, the more you protect your self esteem and convince yourself.Two groups of opposite believe read the same book : subconsciously made the filtering and become more polarised.The more famous, the better the reframing, the less expert in reality, the topper in hierarchy the less he took responsibility and learn from lesson.Admit you win in long term, reframe you win in short term.URSS : idea of genetic is a bourgeois perversion, they were the pioneer in agriculture but when they blocked genetic study they vanished : this what happens when idea were not allowed to fail.Amnesia: they can't remember the past and they can't imagine or create a seen in the future and anticipate.10% of American companies go bust every year Schumpeter call this creative destruction : the free market behave like in the biological evolution.Water pump was developed before thermodynamics law of physics, using bottom-up try and error, next scientific developed the theory.Narrative fallacy: can even explaining contradictory event with same argument, it help us to making sense of the complex life, So if all is simple in the world why test and loop learn from error, why wasting time : If the world is simple, you have to be stupid to not understand it.There is two strategy top down or down up : test and adapt or do the theory.If I want to be à musicien, I must play wrong note first If you run away from mistakes you will be no where.In absence of data : narrative is the best we have, but this way we needs to conduct test.RCT : using random group for long term.Example the scar straight program failure, narrative too seductive to ignore, compared to do nothing its 28% worst increase crime.Example giving free book didn't improve learning test but buying medical does.Marginal gains: break problem in small oneF1 Mercedes uses 16.000 recorded type of data. 12.000 RCT done by google every year on 2010, color choisie generate plus 200m revenue.External validity : some thing works in uk but not Tunisian Brainstorming: do not say negative feedback or criticism ( to not kill the baby idea, not put others on offensive), research found that critique is better : it challenge us. Pressing paper come from applying the same knowledge of pressing wine.Airplane come from applying the same knowledge and technology of the bicycle.Google algorithm is copying cited articles.Creativity is connecting things, it’s finding the hidden connection.Dyson found that cyclone patent already since 1920 : he got inspired in wood cutting store that use already cyclone to get rid of the wood dust.Company that he is working on refused to implement the idea, first prototype done with cardboard, He couldn’t buy pc so used book to note all : 100 experiment per year : 5127 prototypes. He bought 2 book about math of cyclone and meet the authors. You need big picture and discipline to execute small details via iterative improvement. It’s all about obsession and keep trying.Each environment have to arrive to a threshold of imagination, next it needs perseverance and discipline to focus on very small details, more creativity doesn’t add much.You still need a leap of creativity but after is need still of iterative search for the local maximum. ( the leap is to get out of the local maximum for the search of the next one )Be wrong as faster as you can, let’s admit that most of time we will be wrong and move fast toward the solution.Need to find sweet point between the blame and let it go, Investigation should be done by professional and taken seriously not focus on an escape goat, finally you need a trusted juge else loop will break, It’s not about being soft but it about what has really happened : blame is easy way to do the narrative of a simple explanation.Forward looking for accountability ""True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it."" by Karl PoppedWhen we engage with our error, we learn : growth mindset Vs fixed mindset : Fixed mindset success merge from intelligence and talent, if you fail you are not intelligence and talent ! ( failure is debilitating ) : they will try to avoid the challenge even by deliberately handicapping themselves, Challenge avoidance strategy rather than seek feedback strategy Growth mind set see himself learning by error and keep trying : perseverance ( intelligence is dynamic , I love the challenge),Strategy search the weakness and focus on, know your weaknesses and work on them first.Failure is opportunity to begin again more intelligently.Altitude to failure in Japan : if you mess up you brought shame on you and family, you don’t have what it take. Japan has the lowest rate in capital investment in the world, compared to US it’s 20 time less, Japan has the height fear of failure, US low rate.US and UK mindset toward Math: is something you can or can’t,China and Japan is like language with time you get it, with perseverance .Self handicap & fixed mindset : failure lead to acknowledge that you are not bright enough, fear of failure, for short term solution to save for self esteem you need a coverup story.Science is not about defending it own idea: it’s about challenging them and experimenting new one : things still to learn & discover.Galileo : I wish, my dear Kepler, that we could have a good laugh together at the extraordinary stupidity of the mob. What do you think of the foremost philosophers of this University? In spite of my oft-repeated efforts and invitations, they have refused, with the obstinacy of a glutted adder, to look at the planets or Moon or my telescope.In the past science is fix by religion and we have top down : things are simple no need for wasting time on trying on blasphemy.Prospective hindsight : lead should ask the assumption : why projet went horribly wrong, everyone anonymously write a scenario or critics, finally the anonymous scenario should be discussed and add tweak to the original strategy."

52,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50092114-melchor-moro-oliveros,5,"First of all let me say that I’ve got misleaded by the title of the book. I had thought it was about analysing events, systems, history etc. when we do not know all the facts or details that have impact on the subject under analysis, i.e., learning to make conclusions when some things are “black boxes” to us. This is special important in Systems Engineering, where many components that require a lot of knowledge in an specific field interact together to accomplish a final purpose. You must be able to design a system to accomplish one purpose without knowing how a specific component of the whole in detail works.However, the book is about something very different: it is about how mankind approaches errors and how we learn (or don’t learn) from them. The term “Black box” is referred to the blackbox present in airplanes, which is used to analyse errors, extract the “lessons learnt” from them, and apply counter-actions to avoid that error from happening again. The author uses the aircraft industry as the example of how errors should be approached, whereas he uses the health care and justice system as the two bad examples, where errors are hidden, overseen or just accepted as something unavoidable by principle.The book brings up concepts like ‘Cognitive disonance’, the ‘Blame game’ or the ‘Narrative fallacy (Hindsight bias)” which explain the mankind psicology to avoid recognize errors or mentally modify the facts to please one’s convictions. Other terms and methods like ‘Pre-morten technique’, MVP (Minimum Viable Product, ‘lean start-up’) or RCT (Randomized Control Trial) were new to me and thus, I was able to deepen into them through the lecture.The book is entertaining. Not too scientific, therefore ideal for general readers who want to get introduced to the topic: “why people repeat mistakes again and again and seem not to want to learn from them”. The author reinforces the thought that trying and learning from errors lead to the ‘Growth mindset’, opposite to the ‘Fixed mindset’.Finally, I do not want to forget that I have bought this book in a book store in Oban, west highlands, Scotland in July 2018. Awesome trip to the Inner Hebrides."

54,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59290763-shinade,4,I enjoyed how in-depth this book delved into different approaches to failure. My view of failure has definitely been challenged and broadened. The author used true stories and evidence to articulate his points which I thoroughly appreciated whilst reading as it gave me the opportunity to research these events for myself.
55,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38204738-vin-gardner,5,"Black Box Thinking was given to me by a friend as an audiobook, but was so damn insightful that I had to get its paperback counterpart.I used to have an enormous difficulty dealing with my own personal failures. Trying to always find a way to erase that bit of my history somehow. Like using CTRL+Z on myself. Maybe because I was scared of what others would think or didn’t want to lower my self-esteem. But what caused the failure in the first place always creeped back into my life. Black Box thinking changed my perspective on failure and has lead me down a path to being more honest with my own self. What I should have been doing was the complete opposite, tackling failures head on. Being retrospective about our own failed attempts in life is the way to go. It’s how we can readjust our path to our goal, stop insisting on the same mistakes and make better decisions in the future.As Thomas Edison put it “I didn’t fail 1000 times. The lightbulb was an invention of a 1000 steps.”The book also discusses the act of blaming and why it can cause a negative impact in the long run. "
56,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Fantastic. If you liked Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, you will like this. Syed examined the consequences of engaging in heuristic errors, as all of us do. There was a wonderful and heavy focus on decision making in criminal justice and medicine. What would it take to ensure fairer outcomes? How are we preventing such outcomes? Do we want to *feel* like we are making a difference more than we *actually* want to make a difference? What are the real goals when handing out justice or medical treatment? This book is significantly better than Nurtureshock but drives home the same point. In a related note, the author also includes a summary of Duckworth's grit research, which is all the rage since the book Grit came out. So, that will be a treat for readers interested in her work. "
57,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55254605-baldur,5,"It's really important to experiment, fail fast and always find out why and how you can improve. The book starts with a scary story, a one off error in hospital, that caused death. Unfortunately these are reported as ""one of those problems"" and not analyzed. Throughout the book Matthew Syed shows more real examples.In technical world a lot of ideas mentioned in the book are used in Scrum (velocity, retrospectives), AB tests and analytics. The idea of fast open loop is important and usually means a difference between working business and not working one.Another big point is the fear of failure. We learn that failure is something we should be afraid of. This is something we see everyday around us. AB test is not about failure, even though one version is going to fail. It's about finding the winning one. The same applies to different activities as well."
58,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1722508-gordon,3,"Pretty interesting, but as with many non-fiction books of this rote there is a lot of repetition, additional verbiage and incremental reveals. I don't want a 7-page HBR summary, but it could be shorter and tighter.I also found several of the parallels/lessons the author was trying to draw somewhat tenuous, particularly in the innovation section where he repeatedly draws a comparison between learning from mistakes (which are unexpected/in the course of an action) and learning from the failures of deliberate experiments (which are setup such that failures are expected as part of the process). It weakens the overall point (that we should learn from mistakes) by treating these as comparable experiences.By the first third of the book you will feel confident to fly and never want to interact with the medical or judicial systems in your entire life."
59,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1815967-neilp,5,"A simple but brilliant book. Syed neatly contrasts the airline industry (with a history of learning from collective mistakes, mandatory disclosure, improving stats) with the medical industry (obfuscation, secrecy, power imbalance, unnecessary death and injury) to illustrate how there's much to learn from making sure you've got appropriate measures and a feedback loop in place to know that you're improving.More than anything it's about culture and being a society that's more than the sum of its parts."
60,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,3,"The gist: Instead of punishing failures, reward people for reporting and documenting their errors; then investigate and analyze these errors to learn from them. These truisms aren't exactly ""surprising,"" but I guess they bear repetition, since humans are forgetful creatures with fragile egos. This book draws some thoughtful contrasts between the culturally ingrained response to failures in aviation (after a crash, go to the black box) versus health care (after an error, cover it up). While a lot of it is simply rehash of material I've read elsewhere, I appreciate the reminder. "

Then uses carefully chosen examples to demonstrate the application in natural sciences and free markets, but generally not in social sciences.Very powerful, well researched and articulately written whilst also highly interesting and engaging.Every aspiring UK politician should be forced to read it as part of their Oxbridge PPE course."
62,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15006170-chris-nitsas,4,"The book talks about learning from mistakes, and keeping a positive attitude against failure. It frequently contrasts the aviation industry, the origin of the term black-box, with the healthcare industry where mistakes are often hidden for fear of lawsuits. Unfortunately, not admitting to mistakes makes it hard to learn from them.Overall I liked the topic and the way it was presented. The book kept my interest even though I wasn't too sure about it in the beginning."

72,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22972846-nadya-ichinomiya,5,"My favorite book all year, if I could give it 6 stars, I would!Some people are so ""allergic"" to failure, they doesn't even want to say the word, they can't even deal with it. Why is that? And is the avoidance of failure actually something that completely limits, i.e. puts a lid on success? The author of this book serves up a radically refreshing look at failure through the examination of various industries. The aviation industry, where the term ""black box"" is derived from, i.e. offers up the rigorous review of ""what happened"" during a plane crash, not from the point of view of blame but from a pure desire to learn, to grow, so that the circumstances that led to the plane crash won't ever happen again.The author contrasts this with the health care industry, where medical malpractice of many kinds makes it the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, behind heart disease and cancer. ASTONISHING, when you just think about that! Our health care system kills enough people every day through preventable failures, it's as if two jumbo jets fell from the sky every day. Yet the health care industry is beset with the components that nurture these problems - cover-up, obfuscation, and lack of transparency and learning. And these figures don't take into account the people who aren't killed yet are maimed, the wrong limbs removed, the wrong medicine given, etc.Syed also highlights other industries and company examples that do have the discipline of ""learning from failures,"" which is a glib cliché, yet is challenging to actually practice. However, companies, industries, and individuals who do purposefully seek to push the boundaries, who are comfortable in the discomforting arena of failure and seek to fail more often and more quickly, find their courage rewarded by...success.One of the stories that stands out is Unilever's discipline around creating a better detergent nozzle, they went through over 500 prototypes. Another memorable example was the founder of Dyson, who crafted over 5000 vacuum cleaners before coming up with his innovative, game-changing dual-cyclone product. These people, companies, and industries view failures as critical steps on the path to success. Not a reason to stop, and absolutely nothing to be avoided. Indeed, why would someone avoid the critical steps to success, if they want to be successful?! It would be absurd. Yet what one psychological barrier is ""cognitive dissonance,"" and the very human element of wanting to be right, to avoid being wrong at all costs.I found this book particularly compelling to my work since we are transitioning from the Waterfall software development methodology to the Agile framework. Through our 2 week sprints, we will be able to cycle through the software development stages much more frequently, and through the frequency, will discover areas to work on, to optimize, to improve at a much faster rate. The ""fail fast"" paradigm. I am optimistic that there will be a lot of learnings and growth ahead!Another area the book reviewed was the concept that without the permission to fail, truly creative innovation isn't possible. In Japan, for example, failure is greeted with shaming. Hence, is it that surprising that Japan has one of the lowest rates of entrepreneurship, which is a key engine of growth for any economy, and that Japan has been experiencing decades of economic malaise?In society's current paradigm, failure is something that one avoids. And when it happens, one wants to crawl in a shell, to speak, take the ball away and run home, not talk about it or instead, ""spin it."" This happens SO frequently in companies, especially at the top, where there is an ""emperor has no clothes"" mentality. These companies are doomed. And people who have the failure = shame mentality will only stay in their comfort zone, which is the quickest route to the destination of mediocrity.Failing and failure does not equal that one IS a failure. Yet this is the paradigm of most people's lives, hence the drastic avoidance of it!One more thing the book illuminated was the concept of a ""pre-mortem."" This isn't a discussion of what could possibly go wrong but rather, one takes on the idea, during planning, that the project has indeed failed (i.e. the ""patient died,"") and this discussion is about what did go wrong. This planning idea is the attempt to route all possibilities of failure in advance so they can be mitigated.I loved this book. It was extremely well written, with many entertaining and interesting examples. I find the message very useful in my work and in my life."
73,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96926465-louise,4,"This was a solid 5-star read for me... until the very last chapter.Syed has a number of great insights into the psychology of how we learn (or not) from failure, and how assigning blame without going to the trouble of really understanding how a situation happened is virtually always counter-productive. He has a number of great examples, including that of the pilot of November Oscar, a British Airways 747 passenger aircraft that narrowly missed slamming into a hotel. This pilot was blamed and criminalized for the (extremely) near-miss, although it becomes apparent that there were many stressful and unlikely factors that happened to converge and create the situation. Great example, great explanation. Lots we can learn as individuals and organizations for how to create better cultures and promote innovation.(Rant alert...) (And I guess spoiler alert if that applies to non-fiction for you...)Then comes the last chapter (Coda: The Big Picture), and Syed walks straight into the very trap he's been stressing we should avoid. Quoting him: ""For much of the time between the Greeks and the seventeenth century, western science remained in a cul-de-sac [...].""About a paragraph later: ""Why this halt in progress? The answer is not difficult to identify: the world drifted back into the old mindset. The teachings of the early church were brought together with the philosophy of Aristotle (who had been elevated to a revered authority) to create a new, sacrosanct worldview. Anything that contradicted Christian teaching was considered blasphemous. Dissenters were punished. Error had, once again, become disastrous. (p. 297)Then on p. 298, pointing to Bacon's great legacy of challenging ""the dogmatic conception of knowledge that had restrained mankind for centuries."" - science was finally challenging truths instead of defending them. And on p. 301, repeatedly connecting the idea of infallibility with the religious, or a ""god-complex.""So while I won't argue that there isn't some truth in all these things, it blows my mind that Syed just wrote off over a millenium of history on a global scale with the broad stroke of, basically, ... ""then came Christianity and the world was in the dark ages until the Enlightenment came to bring humanity back to its senses."" I mean, he took half a chapter to explain the complexities of a single 747 flight. And yet 1200 years of global history = a sentence beginning with ""the answer is not difficult to identify""?? Never mind the very complex political history throughout all that time, which was intimately (for better or worse) intertwined with religion. Never mind the intense theological and philosophical debates that went into defining the Church's teachings in the first place. Never mind the structure of Christianity itself, including the strong culture to acknowledge one's sins (aka mistakes) and to work to better the self (aiming for sainthood). And of course, the still-existing problem that the scientific method is meant to measure things in the cosmos - but does not work well for things outside the cosmos (e.g., the transcendent), and also does not work well for many of the ""big"" philosophical and theological questions we continue to ask - why are we here? What does it mean to love someone? Is killing ever the right thing to do? Is there a God? What is the meaning of life? etc.Of course I wouldn't expect Syed to unpack all of this in what is largely a science-focused book, and as I mentioned before, there are ample examples of ""bad behaviour"" and narrow-mindedness all over the place in religious culture, and I'm all too aware of that. However, within religion there is also the good all over the place - so I would have at least expected some sensitivity to the nuance and complexity that he expects us to consider in every other situation - politics, aviation, healthcare. I was really disappointed in the treatment of that subject and his obvious bias against religion here.Otherwise, great book."
74,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"The book is highly rated on Amazon and Goodreads, and it's been some time since I last read a self-help, so I decided to pick up a copy.Author Matthew Syed addresses the question that plagues organizations and industries: why do mistakes happen, and more importantly, why do they continue to happen. Mistakes are a part of life, yet similar ones persist when they need not be, and in an increasingly complex world, more mistakes are bound to happen if measures are not taken. Syed explores how some industries like healthcare is particularly prone to such errors whereas the aviation industry, though entirely different from healthcare yet similarly complex in its own way, learns from them and has since drastically improved in safety over the years.The author sheds light on how some organizations exhibit systemic problems and cultural challenges, with hierarchy, closed loops and stigma being the bane obstacles to continual improvements. Using case studies, he draws conclusions on the root causes that allow mistakes to continue occurring, such as under-reporting for reasons too familiar to us such as blind spots and cognitive dissonance.To be honest I thought 'Black Box Thinking' was a self-help book on how to simply stop making mistakes (and a run-of-the-mill type too), but as I read further, it's actually more insightful and comprehensive than it initially seems. Drawing wisdom from scientists and philosophers both in the past and present such as Galen, Hume, Popper and Taleb, he persuasively explains how mistakes happen largely due to reasons both psychological and cultural. He points out the paradox of success: the road to success is paved with plentiful mistakes, yet it's mistakes where learning can be achieved, that people are precisely trying to avoid.Rather than a book with groundbreaking and original ideas, it's one that discerningly collects the findings of others, and re-summarizes them into a coherent and persuasive book that addresses a simple yet complex problem. Even if the book is not original, it's amazing to see how it comes off as one with a simple topic, but in actuality goes much further by looking into the mind of individuals and organizations, and examining the forces that pit the payoffs of learning - such as creativity and environments that allow it to thrive - versus the losses caused by the biases that thwart learning, such as blaming and cognitive dissonance.Syed's book reveals to be an exemplary manual on organizational culture embedded on the scientific foundation of cognitive psychology and epistemology. Somewhat a love child between 'The Checklist Manifesto' by Atul Gawande, 'Adapt' by Tim Hartford, and 'Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson, it's a book that cleverly blindsides readers not just with its thought-provoking insights on how the biggest mistake organizations are making (in sheer ironic fashion), but also major factors that contribute to error committal and their learning process. It's meant for people who haven't read all the famous works conducted by other scientists, and therefore would love to read up about them. Mistakes are a part of life but they exist for a reason, not to be shunned but to be embraced for lifelong learning and continual improvement. Thanks Seyd for your insightful work!"
75,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96417621-mira,5,"Awesome book.Although honestly, nothing is new here. Learn from your mistakes. Keep pursuing your goals despite your failures. We’ve heard it many times before.What makes this book stand out are the inspiring stories and brilliant examples of innovation and success after countless failures, with the aviation industry as a focal point. Matthew Syed kicks things off with a routine medical operation that ends up in tragedy. This fatal incident was dismissed as an accident and not investigated further. ""Things like this happen""--that's  the culture of the healthcare industry. He then compares this with the approach of the aviation industry towards mistakes and incidents. The excellent safety record of the aviation industry is a testament to its admirable culture, despite the inherent risk of flying. He coins the term “Black box thinking”, which is derived from the black boxes installed in every aircraft. In any incident, the black boxes are opened and used to investigate the cause. The information is communicated to the entire airline industry and changes are made in order to prevent other incidents in the future. Black box thinking is about “the willingness and tenacity to investigate the lessons that often exist when we fail, but which we rarely exploit.” Syed calls for a cultural change to remove the shame and stigma of failures. He juxtaposes the aviation industry culture with that of the health care industry and the criminal justice system, which tend to ignore or cover up mistakes, leading to the deaths and unjust incarceration. He also points out the scientific method as another example of black box thinking, where learning from mistakes and failures drives innovation and progress.Cognitive dissonance, our tendency to reframe mistakes, the shame of failure, and the culture of blame are few of the factors that impede our willingness to learn from our mistakes. Syed proposes mindset changes in order for us to grow. Individuals need to switch from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Organizations and societies need a cultural overhaul, towards one that treats mistakes fairly and openly, although it is better said than done. Leaders must learn and encourage black box thinking in order to transform society.He also stresses two ways to approach a problem: (1) through marginal gains or incremental improvements and (2) through giant leaps towards innovation. But the very first and most important step towards progress is to identify the problem. And what better way to do this than through mistakes and failures. You will not know if there is a problem if you don’t fail. Mistakes and failures are crucial.This book is an easy read and contains many quotable texts. He cites many different books, which I will add to my already long reading list (for example: Poor Economics by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo). But most importantly, the book is compelling. Through tragic stories of failures and moving accounts towards reform, improvement and progress, Matthew Syed will transform your perception of failure.  I highly recommend this book."
76,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31609424-andrea,5,"Five stars for this book! The main takeaway for me was that there’s a name for when we try to justify concepts or behaviors that we continue to believe are right, even when they are proven wrong - this is called 'cognitive dissonance.' That is when we reject anything inconvenient to our original position, even when we come to know that we were wrong.The book presents real stories and examples based on research, which makes reading it as if we're watching a movie of our lives. Fear of failure, denial, self-handicapping - all because of our culture of culpability, i.e, instead of learning from our mistakes, we often blame someone else, punish him/her, and go on as before - without having learned any lessons.How many times, at work or even among friends, we avoid trying something new, avoid giving an opinion, collaborating on projects, or discussing ideas, because we are afraid of being judged wrong, because of the fear of failure, instead of being motivated to try our idea or opinion? I enjoyed the example he gave of when he joined a gym and after a while it was clear that that particular gym wasn’t working for him. But, because he didn’t want to accept that his wife was right (she told him to go to another gym) and he was wrong in enrolling there, he continued coping with it until he couldn’t anymore. He used cognitive dissonance to explain and convince himself (and others?) that he was right. It’s sad to realize that this a common behavior in our culture. We prefer to continue with something that’s wrong or is not working just for the sake of being right, or from the fear of being wrong.The chapter about feedback is very enlightening: how can we learn and improve if we don’t know if we’re doing wrong or right? Good point! Feedback should always be welcomed.I want to quote the following phrase from the book: 'At some point you have to make a calculation as to whether the costs of carrying on are outweighed by the benefits of giving up trying something new’.This is a big challenge for all of us. There’s no rule or magic solution for you to know if you should continue putting effort (time, money and even your health) into something, or if you should give up on it. Normally, we feel ashamed of giving up - but there’s no shame in that. It's hard to get everything right the first time or attempt. Failure is not a shame, it's a tool. That’s the beauty of trying. More than that, nothing is wasted because even when things go wrong, there's always a lesson to learn from that experience, so the attempt isn't wasted, is makes you more savvy. This book is about learning from mistakes. I can tell that I’ve learned some from it, and I think that everybody can learn too. And, if more and more people can learn from their mistakes, we can build a better society, where instead of fearing to fail, we'll feel motivated to keep trying again and again until we achieve our goals and bring good ideas to the world."
77,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24117318-donn-lee,5,"Wow, I just realised I took over a year to finish this book!What took me so long was that a lot of what the book talked about seemed like a rehash of what I'd read elsewhere - there wasn't that ""wow"" factor, if you know what I mean. I had read the first couple of chapters, realised that everything seemed familiar, and decided to tackle other books that were more ""greenfield"".Then in the last month or so, being a little behind on my Goodreads challenge (haha!) I decided to pick this book up again and finish it off. And I'm glad I did.My early qualms remained, and yes, a lot of what the book talks about had been talked about in the other books I've read. But none of the other books had it all in one place, focused on the concept of failure and learning. Think of this book like a compendium or short-story anthology of sorts on the topic of how we get better by changing our approach toward failure.What I also realised late in the book was that a lot of what the author talks about is related to the concept of building anti-fragile systems (ala Nassim Taleb). Antifragility was a concept that I found ridiculously amazing, but one that I couldn't find any real practical significance. Until today (when I finished Black Box Thinking).Antifragile systems, basically, can be built to through learning and getting stronger. The more shocks the system goes through, the stronger it becomes. Now think about it. The more ""failures"" one goes through, the stronger one becomes. Mindblown, I know. The parallels were unexpected (at least to me), and it was worth the price of reading the whole book just for what one point.As a leader/manager of a small team who's always looking for things to share with them, I also see tons of material in this book to share with them. Things like the pre-mortem, or pilot testing, or the perspective of evolution - on this last point, I especially liked the explanation of Syed (the author) when he talks about explaining how in entrepreneurship sometimes the ""stubborn"" leader with an intent single-minded focus can be so lauded when in a way he was pushing for companies to be flexible and constantly iterating and failing. His explanation was that you have to look at it from a macro view: having many ""stubborn"" entrepreneurs is like a single economy having lots of different options - the ones that fail eventually die, and those that survive are the most battle-tested. What's good for an economy as a whole may not necessarily be good for an individual. Individually, it pays to have many options you can iterate through as you learn more.Overall, I cannot NOT recommend this book. Though not so much of a ""wow"", if there is one book you might want to read on learning, one that makes a great primer or introduction, this is it. (And also as a summary if you're already well-read on these topics.)"
78,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11391992-stephen-mahoney,5,"This is one of the most important books that I have read and recommend everyone read it. It is important because it will improve the quality of a person's thinking and actions by providing guidance in determining what is true, what to believe, how to solve problems, how to identify false ideas, philosophies, notions, concepts, etc. One should make it a habit to study their own failures to determine what false thinking or other factor led to the failure and pay attention to prevent it from happening again. The author, Syed, uses the aviation practice of studying black boxes after accidents to determine what caused an accident in order to prevent future accidents and increase flying safety. It is important not to stigmatize failure but recognize such as a learning experience. He then discusses how applying a similar system to other professions like medicine and the law improves the successes and outcomes as well as the psychological impediments that prevent the application of such a system. He discusses psychological and and scientific principles that help determine whether something is true, works or may work in the future. For example it was believed for centuries that blood letting or leaching was a useful medical practice until randomized controlled testing proved it was not. He discusses the importance in the feedback loop of determining what works and doesn't by receiving feedback. For example certain professions have immediate or clear feedback (firefighter, soccer player) and others do not (guidance counselor) and as a result the practitioners with a good feedback loop become much better with practice and know intuitively what works. He talks about the problems of ego which leads to self-justification and self deception. He says: When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs. We simply invent new reasons, new justifications, new explanations. Sometimes we ignore the evidence altogether. "" He says also that what we need is not esteem, which is overvalued and prevents us from learning because we might look less than perfect. What we need is resilience to face up to failure and learn from it. That is what growth is all about. Finally as applied to politics he discusses the disasters that were made by communist parties which implemented bad ideas in a top down approach and the benefits of political systems that value bottom up learning, free markets and the allowance of business failures. "
79,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806666-joel,5,"Black Box Thinking is based on evidence that a willingness to learn from mistakes is essential to creativity and progress. The concept is inpired by data recorders, known as black boxes, that are installed on airplanes to record the actions of pilots and the aircraft. The information is then used to analyze accidents in great detail, with each event contributing to the cumulative knowledge and improving safety of the airline industry.The author, Matthew Syed, essentially asks 'why aren't we all like this?' He spends significant time contrasting this open interrogation of failure with the health care industry, where more people die of preventable medical errors each year than traffic accidents. This is partly due to poor process, a lack of data, and potentially ego. Syed casts doubt on the efficacy of some groups of 'experts' that don't adequately measure failure and incorporate it into feedback loops, including many professionals in medicine, psychotherapy, and finance.Success is often determined by how much trial and error is embraced. Productive systems are defined as either 'open loop', where mistakes are acknowledged, shared, and used to enhance best practices, or 'closed loop' where the status quo is maintained and assumed effective due to a lack of analysis rather than confirming evidence. Sometimes what seems like epiphany is actually iteration. A great example is the Dyson vaccuum which results from over five thousand prototypes and years of experimentation. As Syed says, ""Trial and error inspired the technology, which in turn inspired the theory.""Contradictory data and falsification of beliefs drive progress more so than confirmation of long-held views. ""By looking only at the theories that have survived, we don’t notice the failures that made them possible."" The way forward, according to Syed, is less focus on self-esteem, and instead emphasizing debate and personal resiliency. Being led by data and listening to opposing, sometimes jarring views is ultimately where knowledge begins. ""You’re not born with fear of failure, it’s not an instinct, it’s something that grows and develops in you as you get older. Very young children have no fear of failure at all. They have great fun trying new things and learning very fast."" By focusing on process, rather than how we're perceived, the book suggests we can unlearn this fear."
80,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5731542-kritina-gupta,4,"This was a really interesting and an easy read. The examples used throughout the book were relevant to what the author based his book upon, and his writing style was captivating enough to make me want to keep reading and find out how other people made mistakes and what we could learn from them. I think my favourite bit from the book would have to be: ""When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs. We simply invent new reasons, new justifications, new explanations. Sometimes we ignore the evidence altogether"".The concept of cognitive dissonance was explained pretty well, and for me it was fascinating to see how I had possibly tried to rationalise my own behaviour without realising what I was doing. BUT, one small thing that disappointed me was the political example Syed used. When talking about USA invading Iraq, under the guise of weapons of mass destruction, and to remove Saddam...it was disappointing to see that Syed only focussed on the fact that politicians BELIEVED that was the case, rather than any other reason or motive they might have had to invade Iraq. While this isn't a political non-fiction book, I still felt it was a very superficial take on why Bush took the decision to invade Iraq, and I wish that this approach could have been done differently. One thing I found interesting was that the author mentioned that the general public that supported this invasion - for a lot of them the cognitive dissonance kicked in and caused them to further believe the WMD were present despite nobody finding anything. That was more interesting for me to read, because for the politicians - they hid behind the reasons of WMD when their purpose of invading the country was something else. So I don't see how cognitive dissonance would have kicked in. I definitely recommend this book though. It gets you thinking and analysing human behaviour. It makes you realise that despite thinking we are in control of every thought, action, or behavior - sometimes our minds end up playing certain tricks that we ourselves do not realise what we are doing."
81,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43132067-michelle-miller,4,"I really learned a lot about the concept of failure in our society, specifically in how it manifests as progress in specific industries (such as aviation) and how the lack of addressing failures leads to despair (hospitals, justice system)Key Take Aways:- Contradictory information and errors make people engage in a new way and force them to come up with creative alternatives and responses. When things are going as expected, we aren't creative and come up with expected answers. When we are presented with contradictory information or errors that jar us, it forces us to be present and be creative in our answers. When someone is contradictory than what we expect, our conventional mental operations are disrupted. That is when we find associations that might not have ever occurred to us.Steve Jobs said ""Creativity is just connecting things.""Epiphanies happen when:1. We are switched off or step back fo the associative state to emerge2.

These people tend to have a large ERN signal (error related negativity) in the anterior cingulate cortex meaning a bigger reaction to a mistake, as well as a steady Pe (Error Positivity) signal or people are paying attention to their mistakes and most likely learning from it.

82,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6256607-denise-desio,4,"This is not a book you read (or listen to) for pleasure. As included in the title, THINKING is the operative word here, an activity more and more people seem incapable of doing these days. In short, the entire message of this book is to embrace our errors for the opportunity to learn from them. And the only to way to learn from our mistakes is to acquire the ability to acknowledge that we make them. Mistakes are simply stepping stones to success. But in this age of shunning accountability and blame, we are losing precious opportunities to improve outcomes, and even save lives. To get this point across Matthew Syed compares two industries, aviation and medicine, loosely held together by the personal story of a man in the field of aviation who lost his young wife on the operating table because of errors made during a simple, typically safe procedure. Syed asserts that aviation's black box thinking, creates a forward thinking culture that analyses all factors that lead up to a mistake or misjudgment, and uses the information gathered to improve the industry. In contrast, he gives some pretty horrifying statistics about the medical profession, citing that mistakes and errors could have been avoided if only it would adopt the same culture as aviation. Instead, he says, doctors and other medical professionals, sweep their mistakes under the rug, sacrificing the opportunity to improve outcomes and avoid thousands of unnecessary deaths. I'm not going to lie. It's a dry book, and a bit repetitive, but I couldn't help making the leap to people I've dealt with in my personal life, people stuck in a cycle of bad outcomes because their reaction to failure was such that a lifetime of lose-lose interactions was preferable to acknowledging, analyzing and learning from their automatic reactions and making improvements where needed. So, I'm giving this book 4 stars because I think everyone could benefit in their personal lives from exposure to the paradigm that Syed presents. "
83,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58530751-james,3,"I do like Syed and the research he puts into his books cannot be faulted, while his writing is both intelligent and accessible. However, he changes topic too quickly and covers certain strands so concisely that I found it frustrating. So much so that I stopped, and finished it 12 months later, when I was reminded of the other turn off, a tone of 'here's my knowledge I'm imparting on you' that was a bit grating.This is a shame, as he examined the worlds of airlines, medical care and businesses, in order to argue that an open approach to learning is the best way forward, along with a culture of trying to understand why errors were made rather than casting scapegoats. The bits he covered in depth were the best for me, using concrete examples to illustrate his points rather than vague statements, which were much more prevalent in the latter half of the book. Like Gladwell and Harford, the first few chapters are strongest, and whereas Gladwell convinces the reader his titbits are relevant, Syed is guilty of spoonfeeding the conclusions a bit too much, and he returns to this more often as he doesn't include as many detailed studies. One example was that of the Mercedes F1 team improving the transfers of patients between surgery and intensive care, which was short of any real details of what helped (as was the website address he provided) but used to support his conclusions.Together, this was a shame, as I agreed with his overall point and a lot of what he said was interesting. But as a book, there were a few too many drawbacks (such as crowbarring in his pet topic David Beckham), and I didn't find myself as engaged as when I read Bounce which I thought was stronger. Only Syed will know if this book was amended having been given feedback from multiple editors and proofreaders (there were a couple of typos) or if he is guilty of failing to heed his own advice, because it only needed a bit of editing to be an excellent book."
84,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51523768-richard,5,"This book starts off contrasting two industries - health care and aviation, it shows that in many areas of life, such as health care, we just don't put the effort into learning from our mistakes. It contrasts these to environments where learning is critical to feed back into making future issues less likely. The book also highlights how blame for accidents in aviation are unfair just because the person accused just randomly happens to be the first person to have experienced that issue, not that they were actually any worse than any other pilot.The book presents a number of challenges in fostering an environment where learning is the primary motivator and how this environment is extremely difficult to foster and protect, especially in position where peoples reputations are built on not looking too deeply into mistakes.People don't like to be wrong, it is almost hard wired into our brains. Through cognitive dissonance we even rationalise to ourselves or change our own interpretations so that we are not wrong. This means it is very difficult to be self critical, no one like to have done something wrong so re-framing things makes us feel better but it does not help us learn.To ensure that we are properly learning gathering data is not enough, randomised control trial (RCT) are critically important. If we don't do this we can still gather data which shows improvement but we need to contrast that against not having done something to prove that we did actually make an improvement and we did not just pat ourselves on the back. This combined with experimentation can lead to incremental improvements which add significant value.Stories are powerful, to the point where people believe stories more than they believe data. If a story sounds logical and people want to believe it they will, even if there is evidence that it is wrong if this data contradicts the story in a way that the reader/listener can not comprehend or believes."
85,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52553237-angela-lam,4,"This was a nice read because of the sheer number of stories that span from aviation to medicine, business, non-profit and sports. It helps us to understand why we deny/avoid failure (due to cognitive dissonance, fear of blame + cultural influences). And no matter how ""enlightened"" you are, you'll probably recognize your own silly tendencies to shirk blame and deny mistakes. It talks about closed loop systems (that don't learn & keep repeating the same mistakes) vs open loop systems (that keep learning and improving).Fundamentally, the book's key message boils down to this: Don't avoid failures. Change your mindset to embrace failures as building blocks for success. And build systems for systematic learning. The term ""black box thinking"" refers to the 2 black boxes in aircraft+ the spirit of learning from mistakes in aviation. it's about cultivating 2 crucial components to empower people to learn from failure:• The right systems where mistakes are used to drive progress; and• The right mindsets to support these systems.In terms of practical strategies, the book addresses how to develop the right systems (cumulative selection, seeking real-world feedback asap, using randomized control trials, and using the marginal gains approach) + right mindsets (embracing failures in the creative process, cultivating discipline, persistence and the growth mindset, and developing a fair and transparent culture). None of these are breakthrough concepts, but they're quite nicely strung together (with loads of stories) and tailored specifically to address how to learn from failures and mistakes. A good resource for triggering mindset shifts or reminding ourselves that we all have blind spots.Book summary at: https://readingraphics.com/book-summa..."
86,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25132785-terry-kim,4,"Fantastic book on what no one wants to talk about, their failures:-The way you treat and deal failures will have a major impact in every aspect of your life. Those who are more open to admitting failures will examine and correct failures than those who are not so willing. Failures are an essential step that is required for us to learn and become better. Of course this doesn't mean you should go out being a complete failure, but that you critically break down and examine your short falls and learn from them. -David Beckham probably missed more goals than the average person. Why? because he has spent years and years of his life practicing. Michael Jordan has missed more basketball shots than most people for the same reason. The more you fail, the more you learn. -Where possible measure your efforts with real data. Seek feedback and criticism and try to put yourself in someone else's shoes to examine your failures. Expect failure, not in a hopeless way but realistically, Navy Seals soldiers all accept they could be killed in combat and this allows them to take the most efficient course in the heat of the battle.  -Perfection is an excuse, taking action and doing something will get you to perfection faster and closer than trying to come up with the perfect answer.-Ignoring/avoiding failure leads to inaction and blame.-Fear of failure can lead to inaction, this is the biggest enemy. -Blame is the easy answer but achieves nothing. Hitting a child that will not listen won't make them a better listener. Violent protest against police won't make for better police force. Many times it may even have the opposite effect. Ton of great stories and examples and interesting read overall! Quite enjoyed this book and learnt many things."
87,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92857691-sergio,5,"Let me ask you one question, what do you think about mistakes? Are they good or bad? Are mistakes something inevitable or something avoidable? Something to be ashamed of or something to embrace as opportunities to learn?This book is about mistakes, about the error in almost every field of life. Matthew Syed with an enjoyable writing full of catching examples, but also with a thorough investigation, shows us how mistakes shape our lives, our politicians, health care systems, businesses and more.Black Box Thinking is not just a book to improve our performance but also to think about life, as a process of constant learning, full of mistakes that give meaning. And don´t misunderstand me, we want to overcome mistakes. But that´s the word, ""overcome"", not to ""avoid"".What I most liked about Black Box Thinking is the pleasant and practical way of talking about mistakes, giving you valuable frameworks and even implicit tools you can use to improve your life. I would say almost any kind of person could find priceless insights in this book. If you are interested in the way we commit mistakes, how we can redefine our conception of error and the mental requirements to learn and overcome failures, this is the perfect book to start. If after this reading you are interested in learning more about this topic, I highly recommend Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error by Kathryn Schulz. This is a quite more theoretical book but analyses in incredible depth the concept of error. =)"
88,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107703829-chris-weatherburn,4,"As the title suggests some of this is about the safety culture in airlines industry which is very open to analysing errors, using the black box. Compares this to the previous culture of safety in the medical industry, which was less open and honest about mistakes, this has changed over time, in part by learning from the aviation industry and also learning about human factors in relation to significant adverse events. Fair bit about how systems contribute to iatrogenic errors.Without knowing about the outcome of treatments doctors wouldn't improve their skills, in particular this relates to psychiatrists whom the outcome of their intervention may only be known about 20 years down the line. Equates this to swinging for golfballs in the dark and trying to improve without any feedback. Information needs to be shared back freely so learning can occur, punishing people too much means they won't report errors.When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs. This is cognitive dissonance. Contains high profile examples of this from George Bush & Tony Blair.Take many small steps to make improvements to things. The key to creativity is often combining learning from more than one industry. Mentions a lot about small randomised control trials facilitating learning, in particular Google performs many of these, even on things such as the colour of the blue and keep doing these in an iterative process to improve profits. People are quick to blame others, often genuinely perceiving the blame without full information. Via scapegoating, the blame game is very prevalent."
89,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25800375-oleg-ilyenko,4,"Very interesting insights on the healthcare and aviation industries. In general, I liked this book. A lot of very interesting examples and insightful stories. Quite an in-depth read about learning from mistakes and failures. Really like the chapter on implications of the blame culture.What I disliked, is how the author uses term ""cognitive dissonance"" throughout the book. I'm not quite sure whether it is deliberate, but the term was never properly introduced or even defined. The way it is used, in my opinion, is quite misrepresentative and most of the time has a negative connotation. The way I understand it: it is just a very natural biological process that takes place in our prefrontal cortex when we are confronted with the conflicting ideas or beliefs. It evokes quite an unpleasant feeling which pushes us towards the conflict resolution. I would argue that this is a very important process for our learning and growth as cognitive beings. Unfortunately, the book primarily focuses on one specific outcome of this process, namely when we decide to embrace the internalized belief and either ignore or adjust the novel information that challenges this belief and calls it ""cognitive dissonance"". It's a pity that it is presented in such a negative light. if you would like to go deeper in this and related topics, I would highly recommend an excellent series of lectures called ""Your Deceptive Mind"" (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...).That said, I still enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it."

Throughout the book, Syed views the healthcare industry with a critical lens, exposing the cognitive dissonance and structural issues which limit progression in healthcare and other similar industries.Syed does a thorough job in researching ideas around the importance of failure. The data collected in this book is wide, the case studies well-covered. Syed's writing style is easy to comprehend, very accessible for any level of reader.Yet, it does feel like ""Black Box Thinking"" missed the mark slightly. I skimmed past some of the later chapters, which seemed repetitive to what was covered earlier without adding much new of substance. It appears that the book could have been around 100 pages left without losing any depth. The thesis of the book itself is not unique, and has been covered quite well in literature before. Additionally, Syed doesn't explain in much detail how to adopt these principles in your own life, leaving the book having a 'preachy' rather than 'practical' tone.Despite the above, ""Black Box Thinking"" is a good book. You will understand the science about failure, the importance of having a growth mindset and the dangers of ""closed loop"" thinking. However, the book suffers from not offering much in terms of novelty, and drags on in numerous portions. "
91,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"This is a breezy, easy to read, journalistic and story based defence of one main thesis : that systems with feedback to learn from their failures get better and have fewer failures in the long run, while those that don't continue to make the same mistakes over and over. It explores a few other topics around that - cognitive dissonance (especially as it prevents you even admitting to yourself that you have made mistakes), the need to measure in order to improve, and the cultural features you need for errors to be reported and improvements made, and some of the ways an organisation that accepts experiments can fail can therefore actively try more design options.The basic thesis is both powerful and compelling. I do think this would need to be complemented by some more academic and even handed reading before any substantial implementation work. It lacks the humility about its own recommendations that it demands of others, and it doesn't engage with or is dismissive of any of the other tools that are used to control risk or manage optimisation problems in complex systems. And yet, I do feel that the ideas are widely applicable (especially in safety critical industries but more broadly) and that many more people will read a book like this than a longer or more academic tome.Minor pet peeve : the author uses the terms ""black box"", ""open system"" and ""closed system"" in almost the opposite of their control systems meaning. He acknowledges this and you just have to give him the benefit of Humpty Dumpty, allowing that most of his readers are not control engineers."
92,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42463534-martin-vickers,4,"Bounce was so good that I was scared to read this just in case it didn't reach the same highs and tarnished my memory of it. After a ""here we go again"" start, not because it was badly written but because it used a template of real life example that I am very familiar with, Matthew found his own voice and angle. Personally the tales of clinical negligence were not an easy read and I had to stop myself from going back to my own botched operation which I didn't always manage, It did bring a level of wider perspective but also showed just how difficult it is for change. Obviously drawing on Carol Dweck's great but flawed book ""Mindset"" it is a story of cognitive dissonance which is the increasing difficulty to admit failure the more emotionally involved we are. When it matters we can go to extraordinary lengths to deny to ourselves and others that we have failed......unless we and our institutions and companies embrace failure and take away the blame.I loved the section on Pixar the most. I love their films but would never of guessed that the plots and characters change so much from the initial ideas. I have already repeated their mantra that we know we are going to fail so we try and do it as well and as quickly as possible and will try and incorporate this into my work and personal life. A keeper. "
93,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20862374-rich,3,"Syed's book strikes an impressive pose in bolstering the popular science style with solid empiricism. This was a relatively easy read, and has a lot to say about prevailing attitudes to failure in the modern world, with numerous case studies illustrating a fairly wide range of 'symptoms' across industries. He's (rightly) excoriating when it comes to the medical profession in particular, but also focuses on the successes that buck the trend and demonstrate the power of facing up to your mistakes and learning from them.I expected the book to be somewhat kitschy, or perhaps to preach incessantly at me throughout. Happily, my preconceptions were misguided. While the point is occasionally laboured, Syed mostly reigns it in and lets the personal tales and verifiable evidence do the talking. There are some fascinating facts and figures here, all referenced in the footnotes, and plenty of referenced books that I could move on to if I chose. He balances the hard science with a human touch adroitly, and doesn't let the overall message get bogged down in too much nitty-gritty.This was an illuminating and quite revelatory read for me, as I've personally had issues with failure response in my life. I've learned a few things that could help; perhaps I'll have to upgrade this to five stars if all goes well!"
94,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45360894-matt,5,"This was one of those books that I found myself going out of my way to read. Black Box Thinking is a book I feel everyone need to read at some point in their life. This book is long but tightly packed with tons of valuable information, entertaining stories, and valuable insights that can be easily applied to your own thinking today. As human beings, we are all susceptible to letting our egos dictate our thinking. This book articulates how in some instances, this can be valuable but when it comes to growth, problem-solving, and error prevention, letting your ego tell you a mishap is ""just one of those things"" can jeopardize the lives of yourself and others further down the road. The thing I liked the most about Black Box Thinking is how it brings to light this simple concept, invented by the airline industry, can amass great progress if we just simply take a step back and ask ""How can we prevent this from happening again?"". Instead of framing failure as 'poisonous' and something to be ""avoided at all costs"" (even though mistakes are inevitable), we should use it as a tool to improve our lives and the lives of others around us. Like I said, Black Box Thinking is a MUST READ for everyone. This book is not only insightful but highly educational as well."
95,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2926986-michael,4,"It changed the way I approached some of my ideas and actions, so I can't give it less than 4 stars for having immediate impact.In short, the book is about how to learn from mistakes, how to learn lessons from mistakes, and how to improve from mistakes. The book also highlights the alternatives, what happens in industries where mistakes aren't monitored, or are buried? The book doesn't just have to be about business or industrial change, it is about how we all respond to failure, or how is failure treated by those around us. Equally, how can we make the best mistakes to learn from in our work?The book has simple take home suggestions. Each suggestion forms the basis for a chapter, with profuse examples from areas of industry, healthcare, aviation, the justice system, science, business and manufacturing. The author also discusses the portability of ideas, tests, and trials across cultures, and in doing so provides a very comprehensive overview.At times, the book does waffle, and there were a number of points where I was aware of the examples being discussed, or thought the overriding point was simple. But, there were significant gaps or things forgotten in my knowledge that this book enhanced."
96,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777140-alex,3,"In ""Black Box Thinking,"" author Matthew Syed advocates for broad adoption of professional aviation's approach to error. As a professional aviator, his thesis struck me as so obvious that I felt like I was stuck in a conversation with someone trying to convert me to a religion I already practice.Here's the short version of his thesis: in many walks of life, it's normal to handwave mistakes as anomalies, ""just one of those things,"" or the embarrassing errors of incompetents. In aviation, we cultivate a culture of recognizing and owning errors, then sharing lessons learned. The idea is that, assuming a baseline level of competence, any pilot is capable of making the same mistake(s) as any other pilot. By embracing knowledge sharing and professional honesty, we make aviation safer for everyone. Syed thinks this is great, and thinks that other professions and professionals have much to learn from this practice.As I wrote, I agree with him. I also think I need to look around at my own life and ask, ""What other ideas do I take for granted that I could turn into a book?"" Maybe there's a goldmine in something entitled, ""Try Not To Be a Dick, and Other Life Lessons,"" or maybe ""Eat Your Vegetables and Go Easy on the Alcohol."" How hard could this be?"
97,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32056544-tram-nguyen,4,"A good book with eye-opening cases. I read this book during my difficult time of coping with my own failures, so the book touched me somehow. My favorite highlights of the book includes (spoilers alert): - Wald’s disagreement with amy chiefs on where to armor the planes on adversing events. They were only considering the data from the planes that had returned. They were not taking into account the planes that had not returned. “Learning from failure is anything but straightforward... Often, it means looking beyond the obvious data to glimpse the underlying lessons.”- Top down vs bottom-up. Bottom-up learning is vital because of the imperative of adaptability.- Not giving free text books or flipcharts, de-worming children can reduce absenteeism. And it was cheap & a marginal gain. -> Consider what would have happened if the economists had relied on institution & observational data. They might have continued with free textbooks for ever, deluding themselves that they were making a difference, when they were doing virtually nothing at all.- Similar to the idea that you can practice thousand times in the dark (no visible feedbacks) without progressing at all. While the common senses is that practices make perfect."
98,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63222399-ed,2,"Whilst overall interesting this was at times a frustrating read.Syed writes like a journalist and more and more this, whilst engaging, is destructive. When quoting an individual he senselessly informs the reader that they are ""petite and dynamic"". Why? What does that add? He is making intellectual points, he is not writing a biography.He insists that the best way to rack up success is to fail clearly and then learn from the failure - simulated, near-miss, or real - and change behaviour. He holds up RCT design as exceptional and praises falsifiability - indeed, most of the book seems to be a fanboy tribute to Karl Popper. Without any sense of reflection he then insists on using evolution again and again as a metaphor or analogy in business and strategy. Evolution - whilst backed by some evidence - isn't falsifiable. I wonder if his beloved Popper would even class it as science! But this doesn't seem to have occurred to him to consider.This is almost more useful as a signpost to other, hopefully more interesting books. I don't think I'd read more by this chap unless recommended specifically. His approach seems strongly at odds with everything he is trying to convince us of."

If we deny mistakes, hide them, or pretend they weren't even mistakes, this ultimately leads to a decreased chance of learning for the future.We should instead be open and honest about our mistakes, challenge authority if we feel their mistakes could be costly and alter our attitude to mistakes and errors if we are to continue to advance and improve.Having open eyes to errors and open ears to feedback leads to an attitude of acceptance (that we all make mistakes), adjustment (changing our behaviours as a result of what we've learned) and empowerment (if everything which I do is wrong, leads me to a better understanding of myself and the situation, and in using this information, I actively engage in improving the next time, what is there to be worried about?). If anything it breeds confidence and freedom, and could it be that the freedom to actually try and re-try is what most people have never known?"
100,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58591610-bert-van-der-vaart,5,"While the thesis of this book can be relatively quickly stated, Syed says it well and with great examples (airline crashes, medical malpractice, miscarriages of justice, elite education, etc etc); namely; to make progress, we must learn from our mistakes. To do that, we must cultivate a culture where blame is avoided, careful investigation occurs, and resilience and adaptability are more valued than self-esteem. Tricky but critically important. From this he discusses good corollaries: internal external teams, minimum viable product, pre-mortems and marginal gains. But Syed argues very well that this thinking may exist with some scientists--who challenge any theory and keep challenging them to see if there exists better theories--but seldom in politics or economics. He has a special warning for journalists--who seemingly thrive off simplistic blame and shoot first investigate maybe later. Given their role in fake news and the tendency of politicians never to admit they made a mistake, it is clear that we have a long way to go before Syed's well thought out book will be generally implemented. But we must all if possible help in that goal."

If I choose to hide, or finger point, or reject, or stigmatize it, or engage in any form of cognitive dissonance about it, I will not improve, and may well repeat it. Repetition of failure will slow progress, and is likely to cause harm (either to myself or to others, and likely both). The author provides specific insights into how failure is managed in different environments (aviation, legal, medical, socio-political), providing evidence for both the positive effects of learning from failure, and the negative effects of failing to learn from failure.While reading this book, I was asking myself a simple question: Am I drinking the Kool-Aid, or is this a genuinely useful tool for helping myself improve? Today, I can say that it is a genuinely useful tool. I see it in a personal fashion on all of my habits. If I don't try to understand why something went wrong, I will repeat it. I do repeat it, in fact.I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to learn how to improve anything about themselves or their lives. It's very worth the time."

Indeed the guiding principle is that 'there is no such thing as failure, only results and learning points, which can make us stronger'. Success in virtually every form can be traced to 'failure' or 'constant adaptation' and 'improvement, be it 'Marginal Gains', Practice or just simple re-working. Critical is our mindset is accepting and valuing 'failure' and 'setbacks' and great opportunities to learn and grow vs a tendency to 'fear' failure and to 'blame others'. Great book, great factual examples and stories, showing the contrasting 'cultures' of science vs social sciences. Everyone should adopt the 'blackbox' approach, taking time to thoroughly investigate objectively 'root causes' and 'learning points' before judging and taking the data and information to reform and reconstruct new and better approaches. Significant lessons here for the medical, law and teaching professions. Syed excels again at clearly communicating mindset and positive thinking in a clear and inspirational way. "
104,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,4,"This book is a quite fun reading for me, the big thing is we all need to consider ""failure"" is the foundation of success, otherwise we can not learn. Learning is a process of keep trying and dropping the wrong methods to fit the best solution.The author gave us many examples in medical, court room, aircraft security to compare how important to note down our errors like ""blackbox"" recording all the data details so our aircraft security could improve rapidly. On the contrary, in the medical/ surgery mistakes or misjudge remains not so transparent, just like the criminal justice. These 2 involve the ego of professionals, the surgeons and the police proofs collection and judges. Making mistakes is human, but try to cover the mistakes or twist them would cause more chain mistakes. For example: mistake measures in surgery urgent case handling could provide following similar cases precious information to avoid same mistake. To lock up an innocent people means the real criminals are still out there. "
105,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84911382-yang,5,"Fantastic book about growth mindset and learning from failures. The concept is not new, however the author has done a great job laying out the narrative on how to really make it work, from explaining the cognitive dissonance which hinders the recognition of failure to the first place, to the practical tools like experimenting, marginal gains, innovation etc. The rightful adoption of this practice requires a major overhaul of sociopsychological change from individuals to the society as a whole because the resistance to failure is deeply ingrained in human nature.It makes me think of the social and political policies, and it's especially interesting to compare the social reforms of Russia and China. China's reform has been following Dengxiaoping's pragmatic approach, namely “摸着石头过河” （trial and fail）and “黑猫白猫”（a/b testing). It's these learning from trail and failure attitude that made the flourishing development of China. On the other hand, Russia's initial adoption of Western doctrine was a total disaster. "

The author Matthew Syed provides a great number of excellently detailed case studies and real world examples that illustrate black box thinking in practice and show that the most successful organisations and individuals across most (if not all) disciplines you can imagine are those that engage fully with their failures, try to investigate the reasons why they happen and use their findings to improve their performance to elite levels.Also explored are the ways in which you can implement the black box thinking methodology in to your own lives and a fascinating exploration in to the idea of cognitive dissonance and why it is often such a difficult hurdle in the way of regular and consistent acceptance and engagement with failure.I read the book while on a plane back from New York. It reads fantastically well and kept me away from the in flight entertainment without any trouble. I will most certainly be reading more of Syed’s work."

Of course one argument would be that a failure's impact in the aviation industry for example is different from another in a football match, where one could cause lives, whereas the second a simple loss. However that does not justify not learning from the culture of failure analysis / solving that the aviation industry has, which makes flying one of the safest transportation modes. At the end, I think it's not a simple task to adapt this mindset (taking into account the blaming game as well as the fear of sharing failures when not necessary).. however I think it is worth a try.I liked the book pretty much, however I felt that it is kind of un-necessarily lengthy somehow.."

It is a thought-provoking read which pushes us to think about our relationship with failures. I really loved the author's writing style and the various anecdotes which emphasise on how to effectively learn from failures, the impact of marginal gains on success and the need for a growth mindset.We are encouraged to be always right ever since childhood. 'Learning from failures', although a cliched quote, has minimal or no influence whatsoever on our lives. We learn over time to avoid and hide failures and blame others for mistakes. Gradually it becomes our second nature. I think the book does a good job of explaining how to avoid such mistakes and how to take incremental, albeit small, steps towards success. A foolproof product/skill is backed by hundreds or even thousands of failures. Loved it!"

His ideas can be controversial and against the common societal norm and this makes them hard to share with others. What makes this much harder is that his arguments and opinions are so well presented and backed up by scientific research that any attempt on my part to echo them can appear clumsy and incomplete. That’s the thing about Matthew Syed. You don’t really appreciate his diligent and comprehensive work until you try to put all the pieces together yourself.As a fan of Malcolm Gladwell, Jon Ronson and Daniel Coyle, I can say with some authority that Syed brings something much different to the non-fiction genre. Unlike others, his work makes you want to read more and delve deeper into his ideas. Similar books present themselves as a final product or a conclusion. Syed empowers the reader to take a closer look and the wealth of material usually provided at the end of his work enables the reader to easily do so.Another chief strength of his work is that it is much more relatable. The presence of real life narratives and stories in his books make them much more than a cold scientific proposition. Sure, he throws in some popular news stories and well known historic events. But, as I began reading Black Box Thinking, it was the everyday stories that reminded me of Syed’s more human approach.The book begins in an explosive manner with Syed relating to us the tale of 37 year old Elaine Bromiley, a woman who could easily have become just another medical statistic. Her story is just one of many mixed in with the examples of aviation history, operating theatres, courtrooms and classrooms around the world. Thanks to the success of his previous work, Syed’s increased profile has opened many more doors for him so that he can also take us inside the world of F1 racing teams and the Team Sky cycling set up and the mind of billionaire inventors like James Dyson. All of these stories are relevant case studies that allow us to seriously examine modern day society’s tentative approach to failure and mistakes and we often stagnate ourselves as a society by refusing to face up to them.‘Society, as a whole, has a deeply contradictory attitude to failure. Even as we find excuses for our own failings, we are quick to blame others who mess up.’A popular Albert Einstein quote tells us that ‘the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting the same result,’ and this quote is interesting in the context of Syed’s book. Like many, I would have thought that this was more of an individual problem in the world today but Syed proves that this form of ‘insanity’ is rife throughout major organisations too. Yet despite this obvious theory we still bury our heads in the sand when faced with repeated and familiar failures. Syed rightly points to politics, the medical profession, the business world and even the judicial system as classic examples of how damaging and how ingrained these approaches to mistakes actually are.In a very convincing manner, Syed picks apart the common human psyche and our tendency to think in ‘closed loops.’ He then highlights that it is often the best and brightest of us who tend to entrap ourselves in this black hole of thought. Investment bankers holding on to bad stocks and senior doctors come in for much slack in this regard. Then he shows us how some ‘black box thinking’ can help us avoid the pitfalls of this viral ignorance.Syed goes on to encourage a healthy mix of ‘bottom-up’ thinking with ‘top-down’ through an interesting anecdote about a factory floor nozzle. Basically, all the expertise and theory in the world is no match for on the ground application. One hand washes the other in the pursuit of developing success.Black Box Thinking is the book that all of us need in a time when many major world systems are failing. It is a compass that points us in the right direction of progress and it does so in a humble manner. Importantly, Syed offers no quick fix to any of our problems. He talks of James Dyson who failed over five thousand times before he created his dual cyclone hoover. He points to the countless lives lost in the aviation industry that make it one of the safest today. He lifts the curtain on major corporations and successful sports teams to show how they turn the tiniest failures into huge collective wins.Syed’s books so far have lived up to their hype as life-changing. They open up important conversations and ask thought provoking questions. They really do alter your view of the world and its unseen mechanisms. If you work with people, you will be moved to think differently about how people can stumble forward together in the right direction as opposed to living the illusion of ‘smooth sailing.’Would I recommend this book to a friend?Yes. It will change how you look at the world both on a individual and global scale. In many ways, Matthew Syed has taken up the baton of his previous work and once again shown us how we can create better environments for progress. This is a must read for anyone who works as part of a large organisation.AfterthoughtsI would rank Matthew Syed’s first book, Bounce, as one of the best non-fiction books that I have ever read and it has had a profound effect on how I work with others today. Bounce makes an excellent read in conjunction with Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Daniel Coyle’s The Talent Code and Carol Dweck’s Mindset. For me, these books are must reads for any parent, teacher or coaches out there who want to be the best that they can be."
110,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33664639-bruce-jones,5,"One of the best books Ive read.We all mess up at our careers/ relationships/ life choices etc and this book shows just how damaging it is to have our culture that we have towards failure and how we try to cover it up and deny our susceptibility to failure. This book shows how failure can actually be the key to progress and we need to shift our thoughts about failure and accept its inevitability so we can be much more efficient to learn from it.Also to rare non fiction readers this is probably the easiest non fiction books to read, with many applicable/ relate-able examples.Wonder how many people stay in unhappy relationships/ careers because they are too afraid to admit they got something wrong. Life is far too short to compound these errors by denying them and failing to learn from them."
111,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16851167-ron,5,"Surprisingly good read, perhaps because the author isn't as full of bluster and himself as many of the most popular ‘business’ writers today. It's a real book rather than a collection of insights, and quite enlightening. It's the kind of book you want to pick up a few times for a few years just to get your thinking straight and remind yourself of your fallibilities. Certainly not revolutionary by any means, but the author constructs a narrative, or perhaps even a course, on the one key hypothesis, and backs it up with good cases and human psychological fallacies which you may have read about, but may not have seen an action and therefore not applied to the real world. Perhaps the best compliment I can say is that it's evolutionary-one small step forward in books on none of these categories. Highly recommended."
112,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9693189-beth,4,"This book was very scary to read. The research around the justice system, the medical profession and society in general really opened my eyes to how the general public can be manipulated by a societal hierarchy, whether it is surgeons in top hospitals, judges passing sentences or politicians setting laws the bias and cognitive dissonance is shocking. Matthew shows how these systems could be changed if they were looked at radically differently and you took power or money out of the equation. If each of these functioned like the aviation companies who admit mistakes so they do not happen again, society would be a much fairer place to live in. The cover ups and lies which are regular occurrences in these professions because of how much people stand to lose if exposed makes me so astonished at how they actually get away with it. A very illuminating and interesting book!"

Some great ideas overall but the final chapter was hugely disappointing in that he makes the very mistakes he rallies against. It pushes baseless atheistic ideology with a bunch of assertions of fact along with a few poetic bible verses taken out of context and claims that religion and particularly Christianity is anti progress despite huge amounts of evidence to the contrary. Most advances in science have come from Christian scholars over the centuries. In recent years, Francis Collins converted to Christianity because of what he saw in scientific exploration. Collins, in his Christian years, achieved the incredible feat of completing the Human Genome Project inspired by a mission to unveil what he described as “the language of God.”"
114,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45321954-jens,4,"The ending is strong: the social sciences and civic society in general are in need of a scientific revolution and control groups. This should go hand in hand with a Growth Mindset that embraces failure as feedback and a necessary step of progress. If we close our eyes for such evidence, we are doing politics as if we are in the Middle Ages. Decisions in social fields shoudn't be laudable when they show some conviction or strong belief, rather the discussion should be enlightened by experiments. It's pre-scientific to hide ourselves behind fixed opinions and useless debates, that is the way to standstill. Only experiments, openess and some grounded challenges can advance policy on education, finance, etc. The book is good, only 4 stars though, because it was a bit heavy on the stories in the first part."
115,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40488785-almachius,3,"If you've read Kahneman, Duckworth, Dweck and Taleb, there's probably not much point reading this, but it does distill much of what those writers say well but with a focus on the importance of failure.Fairly well written, easy to read, but with a slight arrogance of tone here and there especially in the parts touching on politics and religion: Galileo oversimplified as usual, etc. I would have liked to have had a chapter fleshing out the relevance of failure to common-law: it is only briefly touched on.If you haven't come across the ideas of things like growth mindset, grit and heuristics by now, this is as good a place as any to start, but it's lacking the understated humour of Taleb and the thoroughness and detached humility which I enjoy in Kahneman, and the boring religion = bad theme tagged on toward the end seems quite dated now."
116,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47083601-mustafa-hussain,4,"This book was recommended by safety practitioners and a review was completed in the SHP magazine. First section provides an interesting dimensions, on viewing failures as a learning opportunity and not to be demoralised or deny it, as UK healthcare and criminal legal systems have done in the past. The author uses the airline industry as an example, where black boxes are used to find out what caused the plane disaster and then pledges made for mistakes never to be repeated. As the book progresses, examples are provided of Dropbox, Dyson and Unilever who through learning from shortfalls have grown to become amazing and distinguish businesses. Overall the book does provide some food for thought and I particularly enjoyed section 1 & 2. "
117,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43943856-troy-lee,5,"I can't emphasise how much this book makes sense. The revision of our actions/failures is what makes things better. Sadly, other than cognitive dissonance that is distancing us from reviewing our flaws, ego plays a big part as well, Matthew Syed and his team just wrote an amazing book that directs us to review all our mistakes or even things we did correct. He has inspired me, and I will do a black box thinking program for my university to see how we can improve learning. There is no parallel universe running to see if students will benefit better if teachers made learning more fun. i am a student but I also know that good is the enemy of the great. This book has inspired to look into our education system as a student and see if we can improve it now. Thank you so much Matthew!!"
118,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5826019-tim,4,"This is a great book about the importance of being comfortable with failure. Matthew Syed reiterates on several instances in the book however that just saying ""learn from failure"" is a bit of a management cliché mantra, but the real meaning goes beyond cliché. The book jumps around a bit from examples in aerospace and healthcare, outlining the important concepts from Lean Startup and A/B (RCT) testing, and providing examples in philosophy, the book can feel a bit exhausting at times (and could have benefited from a bit of editing toward brevity). Most importantly learning how to see failure as a learning opportunity and not a blaming opportunity can help you both personally and within business to recognize failures more honestly. Overall a great book that's worth the read."
119,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68970715-marc-levy,5,"People usually view their own failures with shame and see others who fail as humiliated. When facing public condemnation due to a failure, many individuals and institutions yield to the self-serving need to cast blame on others, including the victims. Journalist Matthew Syed propounds a different view of failure. In addition to research on its utility, he includes personal anecdotes of failures and rebounds. He suggests applying aviation’s “black box” mind-set – drawing information from hard circumstances – to reveal new insights and spur progress. Many corporations already rely on failure-based testing to improve their products and services. Syed teaches that a rational approach to failure promotes the personal and institutional perseverance to inquire, innovate and improve."
120,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52061711-josh-laird,4,The Economist said in an article earlier this year that data is the new oil. Companies require it to run effectively and you can distil it into different formats. This book capitalises on the strength of data and how one can utilise it in one's own life. A few examples: David Beckham has taken hundreds of thousands of free kicks in practice. He was nowhere near his skill level now at the beginning but after many attempts he is now one of the best in the world.Planes have a black box that records everything and this box is especially useful during crash landings to ensure other pilots don't make the same mistakes.Successful entrepreneurs are rarely successful with their first company but rather than giving up they use the mistakes they made to be more successful the next time.Aim to fail as much as you can. Fail fast. Iterate. Improve.
121,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013915-tom,4,"I think everyone is aware of the idea we should learn from failure, but I'm not sure that message is ever really absorbed properly by most people. It's one of those phrases you see a lot but people never really act on it.This book sets out why it's so important to learn from the mistakes we make - It's the only way we can really ever improve. However it also spells out how human beings, especially in certain disciplines or lines of work, go to great lengths to rationalise their mistakes as not being mistakes and what that means for the line of work they are in. I felt my brain being gently massaged throughout reading this and will undoubtedly pick up Matthew Syed's other books off the back of this. Great read."
122,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65083325-vassilis,4,"Very good read. Unlike other books of this kind, the author keeps interest high with numerous real examples instead of blah-blah. Main takeaway points: 1. There are two kinds of reactions to failure: getting disappointed or learning from it. If you follow the second, then growth personally & professionally is inevitable 2. Innovation is all about a mindset of resilience with numerous failures & improvements on initial try and drive to succeed no matter what 3. Many marginal gains can lead to big overall improvement. Great men have proven that they worked systematically towards their dream to become who they became. Overall, good choice of subjects and agreeable narration of practical examples from various areas and industries."

The mentality from learning from mistakes in aviation can and should be adapted to medicine, law and other fields."
124,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77745516-khalilah-d,5,"Do you often find yourself making the same mistakes over and over? Do you regularly find any excuse to cover your mistakes instead of owning them? Do you wonder how others manage to rise above these problems and come out the winners, despite making mistakes along the way?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this book is for you. By looking at a few industries in which learning from mistakes is common and other industries in which covering with excuses is common, Syed takes you behind the scenes into the logic behind both of these approaches. In so doing, he shows you the steps to overcoming your mistakes and why it is so important to do so.BONUS: After reading this book, the movie ""Sully"" (2016) will take on a whole new meaning for you!"
125,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77491376-thomas-parke,4,"Really interesting appraisal of attitude to failure. Starts using anecdotes of the aviation industry and its highly unusual approach to failure. Essentially improvement comes from having the 'willingness and tenacity' to investigate mistakes and creating systems which enable effective learning from those mistakes. By adopting a growth mindset, we can detach ourselves from the embarrassment of making a mistake and instead focus ourselves on learning from it. The author explores why mistakes are made in a variety of contexts - intriguingly they often seem to stem from situational factors. Personally I feel this book has helped me with playing sport by encouraging me to adopt a more beneficial mentality to mistakes."
126,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86286201-jade-phillips,4,"It's very refreshing to read a book that celebrates failure and pitches it as a vital aspect of success. Too often, we are just shown images of what it means to be ""successful"" and rarely do we get to see what it took to get there (more often than not, falling on your face a few times). I manage a team and I see how using failure to spark change can create an atmosphere that generates change, and quickly. Perfectionism definitely doesn't form innovation - not being afraid to fail does. It reminds me of Edison's quote about creating the lightbulb: ""I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that won't work"".Great read - it forces you to truly reflect on the decisions you make and confront your ego too, which is hardly a bad thing."

In a nutshell, mistakes occur everywhere, by everyone. People (and organizations, and cultures) can either learn from the mistakes, take corrective measures, and have less problems with mistakes in the future; or they can deny or hide the mistakes or blame them on others, ensuring that the problems will recur, perhaps even more frequently. What I found most eye-opening is that the improvements from investigating mistakes can be a couple orders of magnitude. It might be fair to say that Syed belabors some points, but it might be equally fair to say that those points are important enough to merit belaboring."
128,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57171321-daniel-brooks,4,"A very insightful book - i particularly like the idea of 'Cognitive dissonance' when our beliefs are challenged by evidence; when we mess up,particularly on big issues, our self-esteem is threatened. Admit you are wrong on something very important in your life or re-frame the evidence, filter it, spin it, or ignore it altogether. It's simple but powerful message is that you can learn a lot from getting things wrong, that is why there are so few aviation accidents because the industry is open and transparent when things go wrong. There is no blame culture - they learn from their mistakes. It draws on the idea of the narrative fallacy where we give simple explanations to events which in reality are underpinned by complex probabilities that we are unable to grasp. "
129,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107677067-jan-s,5,"Very good read with many interesting stories. Importance of failure to the path of success. Key take-aways:Beware of things that hinder your exposure to failure/learning: Bias, ignorance, cognitive dissonance, blame, self sabotage, fixed mindset, resistance to change/adaptation, entrenchment of false beliefs with the example of the Scared Straight programmeEmbrace the evolutionary mechanism. Some methods are: Any scientific method that exposes ideas to their fallability snd tests them, testing in general e.g. A/B testing, RCTs, Lean Startup, pilots, marginal gains with the example of the behavioural insights team and aviation industry.This combined with context, grit and a growth mindset should lead to cumulative adaptation which is basically progress."

As an example, he said if you are training a group of footballers, why not divide into two groups of equal ability and train them with two different methods on something and measure improvement at the end. Hard to know where to begin with how unrealistic such a proposition would be.But still a good book, learning from mistakes, iterative / evolutionary improvements, accepting / inviting failure as a good, not a bad thing."

It's defined as a negative thing while Matthew brilliantly status the opposite through examples of Dyson, Beckham and the aviation industry. My favourite part is where he tackles briefly on the relationship between fear and cognitive dissonance. Meaning that our hope to avoid the embarrassment of fear will lead us to stagnate and will only experience successes which will decrease our resilience and in turn will lead us to start protecting the image that we're having of ourselves, even when this image does not relate very well with the reality. Thank you."

Learning about how we make progress by embracing, not covering, our errors is interesting and valuable. As Syed brought each example of how this has (or hasn't) been done in various industries it became very repetitive. I couldn't finish this book. I got halfway through and then said, OK I get it. So three stars because it's well-written and the concept of willingness to admit mistakes in order to change what doesn't work is invaluable. I just ran out of interest after the seventh example. "

Despite being repetitive and probably (although by many standards a small book) 100 pages too long , the way Matthew changes your perspective of failure is a game-changer if applied properly. I find it astonishing how this way of approaching problems is neglected, especially in politics where it would bring a greater efficiency and amount of positive change to people's lives. I personally would've liked to see a bit more detail on the application of marginal gains in everyday life but I'd recommend it to anybody interested in behavioural economics. "

The exploration into the medical industry shed some light on serious issues. Covers a lot of ground, including some interesting psychology concepts: Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, etc.As a side note, the cover and title of this book put me off reading it for a long time. To me, it implied something wishy washy, or self helpish. Thankfully it is not that.Black box thinking takes a look at blame culture. Specifically how critical thinking can be applied to find the problems within the systems instead of focusing on finding a scapegoat when things go wrong. Recommended"

Good lessons to be learned for everyone. I enjoyed the practical examples. The book makes the same point over and over showing different examples of the real world, whether in sport, healthcare, business or politics. I do admire the likes of Dyson, who persevere sometimes for years to solve a specific problem. But what the book says is that people like him are not geniuses, they just are focused on the outcome and failure does not stop them, but they use it to feed back into the process and improve."
136,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64615032-slava-oganezov,5,This book is about viewing everything as black box – collecting data & feedback in order to learn from mistakes. It uses examples of industries where criticism and failures are analyzed and transformed into better practices. The right attitude to failure is the most important booster of progress. Then author talk about incremental innovations (marginal gains) that together lead to a magnitude scale of improvement. Along with radical innovation where completely out of the box view is adopted. Together these 2 innovations lead to sustainable dominance. This can only be achieved if failure is redefined as something positive.

The author adds stories to lighten the intellectual side (I need that!). It also brings the premise to a more visceral level. You feel this book. That said, it was repetitive. I felt there were 100 pages of recaps and retelling that could have been cut out. For what its worth, I enjoyed reading examples from countries other than the US. Being an American and reading locally, the examples get predictable. Nice to hear from another part of the world. In the end, I will (and have) recommended this book. I learned immensely and will most likely buy Bounce (authored by Syed)."

Great insights into successes built on failures at leading companies and bodies such as Team Sky, Pixar, Google & Dyson. Also has some fascinating close encounters of failure within the aviation industry, such as Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, and the heartbreaking story of the November Oscar incident. We do have a skewed attitude towards failure and it really has to change in many areas, such as health care and the legal system. As someone who is constantly seeking to improve and build, I would definitely recommend this book to others as it comes with cogent reasoning and solid advice that could change mindsets."

The book has many references, quoting philosophers, case studies and real life examples. All of these are referenced in the book, so that you can continue with a deeper research into the matter. The references themselves are used in a logical order, with a sound conclusion and summary by the author. Some people might feel that some points are repeated, and the book gets boring after a while, but I did not feel like that at all, and the book was captivating from start to finish. I highly recommend it. "

While giving us these examples of failure, he did a good job of balancing the panic that comes from realizing how messed up everything is with the hope of how we can fix things and how people are already doing so. I found many ways to relate these rather large scale problems to issues in my own life and came away with a better idea of how to improve my relationship with failure.All in all, an excellent book and one that is definitely going on my ""to own"" list."
141,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273362-otter57,3,"The book is based on one premise - that we need to learn from our mistakes. The author does a good job of raising examples from various fields showing what happens when we do not learn from mistakes and conversely what happens when we make mistakes a systematic part of the learning system. The author also does a good job of showing how a mistake-averse culture also leads to blame and fear of creativity. Having lived in Japan for many years, this rings very true for me. Japan tends to attach blame to mistakes and to stifle creativity. Although I thought the book could have been shortened a bit, I did enjoy the examples. "

Syed explains how our attitudes toward failure determine our ability to learn from and correct mistakes. I think the topic is especially relevant in our current political climate. I recommend it to everyone! “Do you fail in your judgments? Do you ever get access to the evidence that shows where you might be going wrong? Are your decisions ever challenged by objective data? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you are almost certainly not learning. This is not a question of motivation or diligence, but of iron logic. You are like a golfer playing in the dark.”"

Full of anecdotes from various industries, personal and professional environments, Matthew Syed explains in great detail the setbacks of covering up failure and the results of these decisions. The central point of the book is to overcome the threatening resolution of failure, celebrate it as an integral part of the human experience, essential after all for making progress through an open, honest and healthy attitude towards lessons not yet learned."

The lessons of this book should be borne in mind as often as possible when considering the culture one wishes to have within their company."
146,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24675464-roxanna,4,"Author used aviation and healthcare examples to illustrate how mistakes are carefully analysed and learnings disseminated across the industry - the better and faster this is done across an industry, the less mistakes are made and more innovative the industry becomes. These examples provoked thoughts on how I can translate these practices to my own knowledge. If you're short of time, read Part 6 of the book first when the author translates these practices on how one can learn from one's mistakes."
147,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26758049-c-j-scott,3,"This book was excellent and makes a very strong case for learning from failure which I agree with. However, the Naturalist and Empiricist Presuppositions are not openly declared as biases or starting positions on which leads the author to add unwarranted validation to the Theory of Evolution, speaking as if it were a fact and ignoring the quite obvious design and intelligence inputs from the juxtapositions he makes with the theory.With that caveat in mind this is well worth the read. It has changed the way I think about failure :)"
148,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28954470-sanjay-vyas,4,"Very readable book. Premise, in short: failure is valuable. It helps us learn. Many forces exist to interrupt our appreciation of the value of failure. The author pushed (too hard?) the notion that we should “never” punish failure, or allow the blame game to happen. I am wrestling with this notion. Perhaps that’s true. But sometimes is failure a result of poor effort? Or an unwillingness to change one’s mind? Is something more than self-correction needed?Best part of the book: many stories and examples. "

It also gives me hope in human development, both on the micro and macro level."

I’ve been so focussed on getting thing project ‘just right’, that I’ve forgotten I need to fail at in order for it to be better.

Especially, the parallels between aviation and medical industries was awesome. When you have a ""black box"" in your organazition you don't narrate your mistakes, the facts speak. Now the challenge for us is how to build that black box culture in our organization or in society. I took many interesting notes throughout the reading process and I'm gonna sum up all of them in my Medium account soon."
154,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3602145-francis-fish,5,"I found the ideas in this book really resonated with my experience in a number of industries.Syed's thesis is that we live in a society that usually plays the blame game when things go wrong. He contrasts this with the ideas used by the aviation industry where mistakes and errors are seen as problems with the system, and not individuals. Because he draws from this industry it uses the thinking behind the black box from aeroplanes as the central metaphor.If something goes catastrophically wrong it's not the pilot that's to blame but instead the system as a whole that allowed the mistake to happen. This systems approach is why there are so few aviation accidents.In the early parts of the book he contrasts aviation errors with medical errors. Doctors are trained not to admit to failure and be ""experts"". So instead of learning from failure there's a culture of ""accepting the inevitable"" and not trying to stop things happening again. Indeed there's a really silly idea that doctors' training makes them infallible.Syed gives an account of one awful medical accident where a young mother ended up with brain damage because her throat closed up under anasthetic and the doctors spent so long trying to insert a breathing tube they didn't do a tracheotomy in time. It turns out that under stress people lose track of time, and can end up going past hard limits (like how long someone can survive when they can't breathe) with bad consequences. In this case the poor woman's husband was an airline pilot and he didn't accept the ""one of those things"" arguments.Eventually after a fight the husband managed to get to the truth of what had happened. Instead of being bitter he shared what he had found in medical journals, made sure that the simple things you can do to make sure your intense focus hasn't made you blind was wider known. For example, you can make sure that all people involved can call for certain things, hierachies need to be questioned. Two people work on a problem, but one of them stays out of the decision making loop and the cognitive stress so they can see what's happening and call time.This information has saved a lot of lives. The woman's husband has been written to by many surgeons all over the world. There are examples of how this telescoping time phenomenon caused crashes of aircraft, but that industry changed the way it did crisis management to make the problem far less likely to occur. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? Learning from failure has the status of a cliché. But it turns out that, for reasons both prosaic and profound, a failure to learn from mistakes has been one of the single greatest obstacles to human progress. Healthcare is just one strand in a long, rich story of evasion. Confronting this could not only transform healthcare, but business, politics and much else besides. A progressive attitude to failure turns out to be a cornerstone of success for any institution.Next he looks at experts. If there is no feedback loop after they qualify as experts then they do not improve. Without being able to measure your success you are stuck, probably making the same mistakes over and over again.If we wish to improve the judgement of aspiring experts then, we shouldn’t just focus on conventional issues like motivation and commitment. In many cases, the only way to drive improvement is to find a way of ‘turning the lights on’. Without access to the ‘error signal’, one could spend years in training or in a profession without improving at allAnd of course failure is necessary, as long as systems are in place to learn from it:beneath the surface of success – outside our view, often outside our awareness – is a mountain of necessary failureThis goes much further than the old saw about learning from failure. Syed's argument is that you must be systematic about it and not blame individuals for systematic failures. But also it is important that individuals take responsibility for what happens and own up when things go wrong. Without this there can be no learning.Another extremely interesting thread later in the book is when he picks up on marginal gains. This is a way to find improvements and is used by teams like the British Cycling team who were so successful at the Rio olympics. In short: everything matters every detail that can hold back success or performance is important and when you address them all they compound together to create an unstoppable chain of improvements. Small gains, marginal gains become the root of great success.Marginal gains is not about making small changes and hoping they fly. Rather, it is about breaking down a big problem into small parts in order to rigorously establish what works and what doesn’t.They use the first test not to improve the strategy, but to create richer feedback. Only when they have a deeper understanding of all the relevant data do they start to iterate.see weaknesses with a different set of eyes. Every error, every flaw, every failure, however small, is a marginal gain in disguise.I heartily recommend this book, it's easy to read and the stories make the examples stay in your head. I hadn't heard of the marginal gains technique but will be using it myself."

The key point of the book is about how people unfortunately avoid recognising failures. I was able to identify some failure avoidance behaviour in myself. What would have been more helpful is if the author could have spent some more time in how to avoid these behaviours.Most of the examples are from the aviation and hospital industry. This becomes slightly laborious.

It was an interesting read with emotional tales to keep the masses engaged. Overall I enjoyed reading the book but I did feel manipulated by the dramatic presentation of stories like Elaine Brombley, et.al. The book was well written and well organized and summarized the existing literature very well."
157,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16930005-niccolo-stamboglis,3,"A clever book on societal attitudes towards failure and improvement. The author shows how changing perspective on failure and embracing it proved critical for improvement in some industries such as aviation, while it led to uncessary loss in others such as healthcare. A drawback of the book stands in its repetition. The point on the need of failure for improvement could have been made without repeating it endlessly."

The only reason I couldn’t give it five stars was there were too many times when the examples droned on. The Pixar examples, some of the aviation stories could have been edited down significantly. But don’t let it put you off. Some brilliant writing here. "

Those who are frightened of failure.Are we really objective in admitting our part in a mistake? What makes people oblivious of their mistake even when it’s staring in their eye? What do you do when you discover a mistake? Most importantly, how do you use failure systematically to be good at what you do?Unmissable for health professionals."

Through a journey involving stories and individuals, the writer analyses human behaviour and attitudes to failure. The core premise of the book is that in order to increase performance, failure needs to be used as an opportunity for learning, but both failure and success need to be measured objectively. By using very powerful stories as a basis for explaining all the principles behind this, it makes for a very compelling read."

His point is so startlingly obvious once you have read the book that you can see why there is such a quantum difference between many industry sectors, companies and individual leaders - and why some people are so frustrating. A brilliant and illuminating read."

Hence it is a book about learning and reducing our resistance to lessons learned through failure.

The way that the concepts are presented makes them memorable and thought provoking. This is generally a valuable book to invest your time in."

170,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13436496-derek-winterburn,3,"Syed notes that some professions are far more serious about learning from failures than other. The main contrast is between aviation (hence 'Black Box Thinking') and medicine. Once that point is illustrated the rest of the book is illustration and expansion. Essentially the moral is take risks, make mistakes, learn from them. The final 'Coda' moves the argument to a higher plane to a wider argument against (bad) religion and pro evolution; I thought this clumsy and necessary. "

Unsuccessful entities cover up their failures, spin them , blame others and don't draw conclusions from them. Successful ones are open about failures and use them to their advantage.

I found the part of the book on Marginal Gains particularly interesting and how breaking down and testing areas of your business can provide significant results. Too often we take for granted our pre-conceived notions on 'best practice' even in the face of adversity.

Matthew Syed draws on stories from aviation and healthcare to show how both have gone on divergent paths in the regards to failure. Aviation has become one of the safest sectors in the world in death prevention where healthcare, ironically in the business of saving lives, are continuing to cause unnecessary deaths and accelerating the rise of healthcare cause. The paradox of success is that success comes from failure."
176,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54954588-zahida-zahoor,4,Learning from mistakes and creating a feedback loop is one of the key ingredients to success. Mathew Syed gives numerous examples where this has worked mainly from the aviation industry where the stakes are high in not learning from mistakes. Mathew gives powerful reasons and examples of why being able to learn from mistakes are curial for self-improvement but also in developing safer societies. The only negative is that the book could have done with further editing as I found parts repetitive.

In doing so, you cumulatively grow through adversity. "

I’ve been so focussed on getting thing project ‘just right’, that I’ve forgotten I need to fail at in order for it to be better.

It is a well-known fact: we would often rather twist the facts than admit mistakes because this generates cognitive dissonance. What is less known are the implications: you cannot learn from mistakes if you equal them to a (personal) failure. There are great examples where this is well understood like aviation, where errors and near-failures are integrated into a learning loop. Every critical incident is an opportunity to learn and make it better. Progress only thrives in a climate of openness where making mistakes is all about analyzing them to get better."

How limited thinking, unable to stretch beyond what you know or think, hampers progress in all fields. Particularly upsetting examples are given of pilots, surgeons, attorneys who cannot deviate from what they are thinking even when subordinates offer alternatives to the mistakes they see them making, often resulting in death or incarceration of many. Even if you just do the first chapter it'll give you enough chilling examples of arrogance and/or cognitive dissonance at work. None of us are immune. Fascinating."
213,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71814310-vugar,5,"I liked the book. I'd love to give 4.5 but I can't :) For me the best lesson was to look at the failures from another perspective. Especially, the parallels between aviation and medical industries was awesome. When you have a ""black box"" in your organazition you don't narrate your mistakes, the facts speak. Now the challenge for us is how to build that black box culture in our organization or in society. I took many interesting notes throughout the reading process and I'm gonna sum up all of them in my Medium account soon."
214,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3602145-francis-fish,5,"I found the ideas in this book really resonated with my experience in a number of industries.Syed's thesis is that we live in a society that usually plays the blame game when things go wrong. He contrasts this with the ideas used by the aviation industry where mistakes and errors are seen as problems with the system, and not individuals. Because he draws from this industry it uses the thinking behind the black box from aeroplanes as the central metaphor.If something goes catastrophically wrong it's not the pilot that's to blame but instead the system as a whole that allowed the mistake to happen. This systems approach is why there are so few aviation accidents.In the early parts of the book he contrasts aviation errors with medical errors. Doctors are trained not to admit to failure and be ""experts"". So instead of learning from failure there's a culture of ""accepting the inevitable"" and not trying to stop things happening again. Indeed there's a really silly idea that doctors' training makes them infallible.Syed gives an account of one awful medical accident where a young mother ended up with brain damage because her throat closed up under anasthetic and the doctors spent so long trying to insert a breathing tube they didn't do a tracheotomy in time. It turns out that under stress people lose track of time, and can end up going past hard limits (like how long someone can survive when they can't breathe) with bad consequences. In this case the poor woman's husband was an airline pilot and he didn't accept the ""one of those things"" arguments.Eventually after a fight the husband managed to get to the truth of what had happened. Instead of being bitter he shared what he had found in medical journals, made sure that the simple things you can do to make sure your intense focus hasn't made you blind was wider known. For example, you can make sure that all people involved can call for certain things, hierachies need to be questioned. Two people work on a problem, but one of them stays out of the decision making loop and the cognitive stress so they can see what's happening and call time.This information has saved a lot of lives. The woman's husband has been written to by many surgeons all over the world. There are examples of how this telescoping time phenomenon caused crashes of aircraft, but that industry changed the way it did crisis management to make the problem far less likely to occur. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? Learning from failure has the status of a cliché. But it turns out that, for reasons both prosaic and profound, a failure to learn from mistakes has been one of the single greatest obstacles to human progress. Healthcare is just one strand in a long, rich story of evasion. Confronting this could not only transform healthcare, but business, politics and much else besides. A progressive attitude to failure turns out to be a cornerstone of success for any institution.Next he looks at experts. If there is no feedback loop after they qualify as experts then they do not improve. Without being able to measure your success you are stuck, probably making the same mistakes over and over again.If we wish to improve the judgement of aspiring experts then, we shouldn’t just focus on conventional issues like motivation and commitment. In many cases, the only way to drive improvement is to find a way of ‘turning the lights on’. Without access to the ‘error signal’, one could spend years in training or in a profession without improving at allAnd of course failure is necessary, as long as systems are in place to learn from it:beneath the surface of success – outside our view, often outside our awareness – is a mountain of necessary failureThis goes much further than the old saw about learning from failure. Syed's argument is that you must be systematic about it and not blame individuals for systematic failures. But also it is important that individuals take responsibility for what happens and own up when things go wrong. Without this there can be no learning.Another extremely interesting thread later in the book is when he picks up on marginal gains. This is a way to find improvements and is used by teams like the British Cycling team who were so successful at the Rio olympics. In short: everything matters every detail that can hold back success or performance is important and when you address them all they compound together to create an unstoppable chain of improvements. Small gains, marginal gains become the root of great success.Marginal gains is not about making small changes and hoping they fly. Rather, it is about breaking down a big problem into small parts in order to rigorously establish what works and what doesn’t.They use the first test not to improve the strategy, but to create richer feedback. Only when they have a deeper understanding of all the relevant data do they start to iterate.see weaknesses with a different set of eyes. Every error, every flaw, every failure, however small, is a marginal gain in disguise.I heartily recommend this book, it's easy to read and the stories make the examples stay in your head. I hadn't heard of the marginal gains technique but will be using it myself."

I’ve been so focussed on getting thing project ‘just right’, that I’ve forgotten I need to fail at in order for it to be better.

Especially, the parallels between aviation and medical industries was awesome. When you have a ""black box"" in your organazition you don't narrate your mistakes, the facts speak. Now the challenge for us is how to build that black box culture in our organization or in society. I took many interesting notes throughout the reading process and I'm gonna sum up all of them in my Medium account soon."
244,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3602145-francis-fish,5,"I found the ideas in this book really resonated with my experience in a number of industries.Syed's thesis is that we live in a society that usually plays the blame game when things go wrong. He contrasts this with the ideas used by the aviation industry where mistakes and errors are seen as problems with the system, and not individuals. Because he draws from this industry it uses the thinking behind the black box from aeroplanes as the central metaphor.If something goes catastrophically wrong it's not the pilot that's to blame but instead the system as a whole that allowed the mistake to happen. This systems approach is why there are so few aviation accidents.In the early parts of the book he contrasts aviation errors with medical errors. Doctors are trained not to admit to failure and be ""experts"". So instead of learning from failure there's a culture of ""accepting the inevitable"" and not trying to stop things happening again. Indeed there's a really silly idea that doctors' training makes them infallible.Syed gives an account of one awful medical accident where a young mother ended up with brain damage because her throat closed up under anasthetic and the doctors spent so long trying to insert a breathing tube they didn't do a tracheotomy in time. It turns out that under stress people lose track of time, and can end up going past hard limits (like how long someone can survive when they can't breathe) with bad consequences. In this case the poor woman's husband was an airline pilot and he didn't accept the ""one of those things"" arguments.Eventually after a fight the husband managed to get to the truth of what had happened. Instead of being bitter he shared what he had found in medical journals, made sure that the simple things you can do to make sure your intense focus hasn't made you blind was wider known. For example, you can make sure that all people involved can call for certain things, hierachies need to be questioned. Two people work on a problem, but one of them stays out of the decision making loop and the cognitive stress so they can see what's happening and call time.This information has saved a lot of lives. The woman's husband has been written to by many surgeons all over the world. There are examples of how this telescoping time phenomenon caused crashes of aircraft, but that industry changed the way it did crisis management to make the problem far less likely to occur. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? Learning from failure has the status of a cliché. But it turns out that, for reasons both prosaic and profound, a failure to learn from mistakes has been one of the single greatest obstacles to human progress. Healthcare is just one strand in a long, rich story of evasion. Confronting this could not only transform healthcare, but business, politics and much else besides. A progressive attitude to failure turns out to be a cornerstone of success for any institution.Next he looks at experts. If there is no feedback loop after they qualify as experts then they do not improve. Without being able to measure your success you are stuck, probably making the same mistakes over and over again.If we wish to improve the judgement of aspiring experts then, we shouldn’t just focus on conventional issues like motivation and commitment. In many cases, the only way to drive improvement is to find a way of ‘turning the lights on’. Without access to the ‘error signal’, one could spend years in training or in a profession without improving at allAnd of course failure is necessary, as long as systems are in place to learn from it:beneath the surface of success – outside our view, often outside our awareness – is a mountain of necessary failureThis goes much further than the old saw about learning from failure. Syed's argument is that you must be systematic about it and not blame individuals for systematic failures. But also it is important that individuals take responsibility for what happens and own up when things go wrong. Without this there can be no learning.Another extremely interesting thread later in the book is when he picks up on marginal gains. This is a way to find improvements and is used by teams like the British Cycling team who were so successful at the Rio olympics. In short: everything matters every detail that can hold back success or performance is important and when you address them all they compound together to create an unstoppable chain of improvements. Small gains, marginal gains become the root of great success.Marginal gains is not about making small changes and hoping they fly. Rather, it is about breaking down a big problem into small parts in order to rigorously establish what works and what doesn’t.They use the first test not to improve the strategy, but to create richer feedback. Only when they have a deeper understanding of all the relevant data do they start to iterate.see weaknesses with a different set of eyes. Every error, every flaw, every failure, however small, is a marginal gain in disguise.I heartily recommend this book, it's easy to read and the stories make the examples stay in your head. I hadn't heard of the marginal gains technique but will be using it myself."

The key point of the book is about how people unfortunately avoid recognising failures. I was able to identify some failure avoidance behaviour in myself. What would have been more helpful is if the author could have spent some more time in how to avoid these behaviours.Most of the examples are from the aviation and hospital industry.

251,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48265917-remco,5,"Excellent read, very thought provoking. Through a journey involving stories and individuals, the writer analyses human behaviour and attitudes to failure. The core premise of the book is that in order to increase performance, failure needs to be used as an opportunity for learning, but both failure and success need to be measured objectively. By using very powerful stories as a basis for explaining all the principles behind this, it makes for a very compelling read."
252,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25150243-julian-walker,5,"Simply superb thinking - be not afraid to try, but be ready to learn from failure.Syed delivers his message eloquently and engagingly, with tangible anecdotes and, at times, exasperating illustrations. His point is so startlingly obvious once you have read the book that you can see why there is such a quantum difference between many industry sectors, companies and individual leaders - and why some people are so frustrating. A brilliant and illuminating read."
253,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48820434-mike-shaw,5,Lots of great insights that the author presents through excellent stories. It would be a disservice to try to summarize them here here but they REALLY prove the point that humans are very good at deluding themselves.

I had to work out where the inaccuracies would be and allow for them."

256,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45385985-peter,5,"Black box thinking explores the many possibilities that can rise after failure. Hence it is a book about learning and reducing our resistance to lessons learned through failure. To support the core idea of the book, the author brings many examples of how people can resist learning either by cognitive dissonance, fear, or complete disregard of reality. The way that the concepts are presented makes them memorable and thought provoking. This is generally a valuable book to invest your time in."
257,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5244950-eric,5,"A terrific read about how to fully leverage mistakes as learning opportunities, achieve a growth mindset, and build a culture of robust learning into your team. Plus, thorough breakdowns of some of the natural human biases that get in the way of accomplishing all this, along with detailed real-life case studies of high-stakes mistakes in a number of fields, including examples of both successes and failures to learn and overcome."

This book explains real life situations that occurred in past and why the thinking is different between pilot and doctors when saving passengers and patients. There is so much more than that, this book gives you so many different perspectives of life. "

I’m looking forward to sharing this with coworkers and applying it to my work with kidlets. I felt like it would have made a good side-by-side read with Freakinomics. Definitely provided some interesting ways of looking at our world, ourselves, our tendency to assign blame for things gone wrong, and how we can improve on this information. "
260,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13436496-derek-winterburn,3,"Syed notes that some professions are far more serious about learning from failures than other. The main contrast is between aviation (hence 'Black Box Thinking') and medicine. Once that point is illustrated the rest of the book is illustration and expansion. Essentially the moral is take risks, make mistakes, learn from them. The final 'Coda' moves the argument to a higher plane to a wider argument against (bad) religion and pro evolution; I thought this clumsy and necessary. "

(Medical Failures , criminal Justice etc) Its a wake up call to reflect your own interactions not only in your Profession but in your Private Life."
262,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30012325-juan-farf-n,5,Great book! It shows clearly that not only we must learn from failure but also that we need to embrace it. Learning from failure is at the heart of the scientific method and has allowed knowledge and technology to keep progressing. Once we have a culture or mindset that condemns failure progresses and learning stagnates. Great book if you’re looking to improve not only your critical thinking skills but your life in general 
263,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84761355-michal,5,"An inspiring book claiming that the common theme among successful individuals and organizations is their approach towards failures. Unsuccessful entities cover up their failures, spin them , blame others and don't draw conclusions from them. Successful ones are open about failures and use them to their advantage. The book is rich in very interesting examples from the history , facts from psychology and philosophy, explaining how and why we are so resilient to dealing with failures. "
264,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91566912-jonathan-cons,4,This was almost a 5*. The book starts a bit slow but what you realise is Matthew is setting the scene for some fantastic case studies around the acceptance of failure as a stage for learning. I found the part of the book on Marginal Gains particularly interesting and how breaking down and testing areas of your business can provide significant results. Too often we take for granted our pre-conceived notions on 'best practice' even in the face of adversity.
265,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23381734-aaron-seng,5,"This is one of the best books I have read on ""failure"". Matthew Syed draws on stories from aviation and healthcare to show how both have gone on divergent paths in the regards to failure. Aviation has become one of the safest sectors in the world in death prevention where healthcare, ironically in the business of saving lives, are continuing to cause unnecessary deaths and accelerating the rise of healthcare cause. The paradox of success is that success comes from failure."
266,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54954588-zahida-zahoor,4,Learning from mistakes and creating a feedback loop is one of the key ingredients to success. Mathew Syed gives numerous examples where this has worked mainly from the aviation industry where the stakes are high in not learning from mistakes. Mathew gives powerful reasons and examples of why being able to learn from mistakes are curial for self-improvement but also in developing safer societies. The only negative is that the book could have done with further editing as I found parts repetitive.

Through a journey involving stories and individuals, the writer analyses human behaviour and attitudes to failure. The core premise of the book is that in order to increase performance, failure needs to be used as an opportunity for learning, but both failure and success need to be measured objectively. By using very powerful stories as a basis for explaining all the principles behind this, it makes for a very compelling read."
282,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25150243-julian-walker,5,"Simply superb thinking - be not afraid to try, but be ready to learn from failure.Syed delivers his message eloquently and engagingly, with tangible anecdotes and, at times, exasperating illustrations. His point is so startlingly obvious once you have read the book that you can see why there is such a quantum difference between many industry sectors, companies and individual leaders - and why some people are so frustrating. A brilliant and illuminating read."
283,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48820434-mike-shaw,5,Lots of great insights that the author presents through excellent stories. It would be a disservice to try to summarize them here here but they REALLY prove the point that humans are very good at deluding themselves. Loved the “Pre-Morten” suggestion at the end.I’m now trying to determine some tests I can run on my own life to see where I can make it better. Easy read that I highly recommend. 
284,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152172-stephen-murray,5,"A must read for anyone trying to be better.A highly illuminating book about understanding error and the dangers of the blame culture. I remember realising as a young engineer that if it took me 4 days to build a prototype then the production machine, built by someone less skilled than me in 4 hours was never going to work so well. I had to work out where the inaccuracies would be and allow for them."
285,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82828872-phil-topping,5,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!One of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. Taught me so much about learning form mistakes and failure and how to embrace it. This is an area that I have struggled with all my life, I wish that I could have read this when I was a teenager, it would have changed my life.I will be encouraging my kids to read this! And will be re-reading it my self constantly!Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
286,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45385985-peter,5,"Black box thinking explores the many possibilities that can rise after failure. Hence it is a book about learning and reducing our resistance to lessons learned through failure. To support the core idea of the book, the author brings many examples of how people can resist learning either by cognitive dissonance, fear, or complete disregard of reality. The way that the concepts are presented makes them memorable and thought provoking. This is generally a valuable book to invest your time in."
287,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5244950-eric,5,"A terrific read about how to fully leverage mistakes as learning opportunities, achieve a growth mindset, and build a culture of robust learning into your team. Plus, thorough breakdowns of some of the natural human biases that get in the way of accomplishing all this, along with detailed real-life case studies of high-stakes mistakes in a number of fields, including examples of both successes and failures to learn and overcome."
288,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93351147-nikita-rania,5,"This book gives you an amazing experience of what doctors and pilots go through and what sort of thinking, decisions they have to take in difficult situations. This book explains real life situations that occurred in past and why the thinking is different between pilot and doctors when saving passengers and patients. There is so much more than that, this book gives you so many different perspectives of life. "
289,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5613349-dana,4,"Interesting, information, and inspirational. Many practical stories about failure and how to learn from it. I’m looking forward to sharing this with coworkers and applying it to my work with kidlets. I felt like it would have made a good side-by-side read with Freakinomics. Definitely provided some interesting ways of looking at our world, ourselves, our tendency to assign blame for things gone wrong, and how we can improve on this information. "
290,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13436496-derek-winterburn,3,"Syed notes that some professions are far more serious about learning from failures than other. The main contrast is between aviation (hence 'Black Box Thinking') and medicine. Once that point is illustrated the rest of the book is illustration and expansion. Essentially the moral is take risks, make mistakes, learn from them. The final 'Coda' moves the argument to a higher plane to a wider argument against (bad) religion and pro evolution; I thought this clumsy and necessary. "
291,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66091787-ines,5,"It took me a long time to read this Book I have read some chapters at first and then put it away but never lost interest.It is brilliant and shocking.I have even recommend it at a Bookclub back then but failed to bring the insights to the point.It is not just another selfhelp bookIts an Intense Book that tells real life Facts and about Tragedies that we have witnessed and read about in the news.Failures which made it them happen back then and are still happening in all Work Industry’s daily. (Medical Failures , criminal Justice etc) Its a wake up call to reflect your own interactions not only in your Profession but in your Private Life."
292,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30012325-juan-farf-n,5,Great book! It shows clearly that not only we must learn from failure but also that we need to embrace it. Learning from failure is at the heart of the scientific method and has allowed knowledge and technology to keep progressing. Once we have a culture or mindset that condemns failure progresses and learning stagnates. Great book if you’re looking to improve not only your critical thinking skills but your life in general 
293,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84761355-michal,5,"An inspiring book claiming that the common theme among successful individuals and organizations is their approach towards failures. Unsuccessful entities cover up their failures, spin them , blame others and don't draw conclusions from them. Successful ones are open about failures and use them to their advantage. The book is rich in very interesting examples from the history , facts from psychology and philosophy, explaining how and why we are so resilient to dealing with failures. "
294,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91566912-jonathan-cons,4,This was almost a 5*. The book starts a bit slow but what you realise is Matthew is setting the scene for some fantastic case studies around the acceptance of failure as a stage for learning. I found the part of the book on Marginal Gains particularly interesting and how breaking down and testing areas of your business can provide significant results. Too often we take for granted our pre-conceived notions on 'best practice' even in the face of adversity.
295,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23381734-aaron-seng,5,"This is one of the best books I have read on ""failure"". Matthew Syed draws on stories from aviation and healthcare to show how both have gone on divergent paths in the regards to failure. Aviation has become one of the safest sectors in the world in death prevention where healthcare, ironically in the business of saving lives, are continuing to cause unnecessary deaths and accelerating the rise of healthcare cause. The paradox of success is that success comes from failure."
296,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54954588-zahida-zahoor,4,Learning from mistakes and creating a feedback loop is one of the key ingredients to success. Mathew Syed gives numerous examples where this has worked mainly from the aviation industry where the stakes are high in not learning from mistakes. Mathew gives powerful reasons and examples of why being able to learn from mistakes are curial for self-improvement but also in developing safer societies. The only negative is that the book could have done with further editing as I found parts repetitive.
297,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22577158-jon-margetts,4,"Read about 4/5s of this a few months ago, and have just polished it off. Great book with many insights into cognitive bias and the growth mindset. As it says, it's important to adopt strategies which allow you to turn mistakes and errors from disasters into opportunities for personal development. In doing so, you cumulatively grow through adversity. "
298,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55657176-andre-lichtenstein,5,"Everybody probably already noticed that when we study very hard for an exam and get an almost perfect score, the mistake we made is the one thing we will remember for a long time. And if we approach it the right way, probably the thing we are going to really learn for the future. This is an excellent book about learning with mistakes and evolving. I recomend it for everyone."
299,1591848229,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68890608-gary-watts,4,"uses some very good case studies to illustrate cognitive dissonance and fixed/closed-loop thinking, and the dangers that can bring in decision making in pressurised environments. heavy going in part, but I give this 4 stars as it has had a positive effect on my view of the world and I will come back to this book"
