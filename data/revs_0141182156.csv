0,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,1," REVIEW OF THE BOOK AS A WHOLEReally, the title should have warned me that I was unlikely to get along with this book - but it doesn't actually say, Physics and Metaphysics. I have very little time for metaphysics; it's day is long since past (couple of millenia, at least) and it is really only of historical interest to those concerned with understanding nature. Far too much of the book is spent on either; comparing quantum mechanics (QM) with Western metaphysics or pondering unanswerable conundrums, like, ""does anything exist when it isn't being observed?"" and ""what type of reality is really real?"" What science does (with increasing precision over time) is attempt to explain the contents and behaviour of nature, not whether it is ""dogmatically objective"" or some other type of objective or subjective or, who knows, subjunctive or conjunctive or metastatically cancerous...This comparison with western metaphysics is as profitless as the later (80s-90s) fad for comparison with ""eastern philosophy."" Metaphysics, regardless of hemisphere did not lead to nuclear reactors and smart phones, so any apparent correspondences are vague, incomplete and of no practical use.Heisenberg seems inconsistent at times, which is a bit naff in a book on science or philosophy, let alone both. For instance, he states categorically that no human observer is actually necessary in QM but later seems to tacitly assume the opposite. He's also wrong about a few things, but only in the light of 50 years' worth of further scientific investigations.I also don't know who the intended audience is; he assumes quite a bit of knowledge of both physics and metaphysics - certainly too much of the former for a non-physicist audience now or then and too much of the latter for present-day non-philosophy students.Probably the only really valuable insight I got from the book was the point that General Relativity isn't a limiting case or approximation of (or to) any other physical theory: it famously can't be integrated into any current quantum theory but it can't be derived from any other classical theory either, not can any other classical theory be derived from it: It just stands there in majestic aloofness. It has done since it was first published and still does now.The other segment of interest to me was the final chapter on the influence of science in general and modern physics in particular on contemporary society - here's where I think general philosophical thought might profitably be focused, along with close examination of recent history.The book also seems badly organised; why does the chapter on alternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation of QM not follow immediately after the chapter on the Copenhagen Interpretation itself, for instance?I find it difficult to recommend this book to anybody: if you want to become familiar with the central concepts of QM, The Character of Physical Law by R.P. Feynman is enormously better. Einstein's own book is a much better introduction to Relativity theory (especially if you can remember school algebra). If you are interested in the philosophy of science, this book won't help. It's too out of date to work as an introduction to the state of contemporary fundamental physics. The only bits that seem to remain really relevant are the thoughts about the use of language in science and the thoughts on science's impact on society at large.Below the line: more or less chapter by chapter thoughts whilst reading.___________________________________________________________________________Insufficient room in the status update field so I'm gonna have to post my thoughts here as I go along.Despite the lack of mathematics, I already can't recommend this for non-physicists: I think they'd be terribly confused and horribly lost by the end of Chapter 2. On the other hand, this might be very good for current physics undergrads who've done an atomic physics course already.Interesting errors and confusions in Chapter 3:Conservation of energy: Heisenberg states that initially this was believed to be true only statistically for quantum systems but in fact turned out to be exactly true always. This is not correct; conservation of energy can only be said to hold to the accuracy given by - fanfare! - The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! One of the bizarre consequences of this is the phenomenon of quantum tunneling, which was unknown at the time of publication.Heisenberg states that quantum mechanical experiments consist of three parts, an initial set up in terms of classical physics, an unobservable part only describable in terms of what we would now call the probability wave-function, and a measurement only describable in terms of classical physics. Only the middle part of this is correct; it is entirely possible to describe an experimental set-up in quantum terms and also the measurement of the result in quantum terms, too. (The middle bit is indeed not describable in any normal sense.) Take the photon double-slit experiment. The emission of the photons can be described quantum mechanically but so can their reception at the detector if you use photo-multiplier detectors, for example.Ah! I hear you cry, but the real observation is by the human eye, when the flash from the photo-multiplier hits the retina!Sorry - the optic nerve is a receptor of quanta, too. The whole system is describable quantum mechanically.Heisenberg then goes on to more or less follow my argument in a vague way. (It's enormously easier to make it precise in the light of half a century's technological advances.)And here's something really important that we agree on. The human observer is not in any way an essential part of the system. The idea that the entire universe stopped being just a cloud of probabilities the day a sufficiently astute observer appeared is not in any way required by or implicit in the Copenhagen Interpretation....and we're only about 1/6th the way through...Chapter 4: Waffling comparison of ancient Greek philosophy and quantum mechanics. The most important thing here is the bit where he explains the difference i.e. QM is based on experiment where-as ancient Greek philosophy is based on yabbering on without having a clue.Some interesting points are raised, though; ""What's a particle?"" is a very hard question to answer in QM. ""It's a probability wave packet,"" isn't a very good answer; it's a form of energy is better (except, what's energy?). Today you might get, ""it's a resonance in a field."" Leading straight on to, ""What's field?"" Well, it's something emitted by particles that controls how they interact with each other... This is just wave-particle duality all over again, with waves disguised as fields.He also expresses the views that the ultimate quantum theory would take the form of a single equation that would yield solutions representing the fundamental particles and the forces between them and that in fact there will turn out to only be one kind of particle that is truly fundamental. The former is the approach taken by current Guess the Lagrangian approaches to the problem and the latter is adopted in string theories (all 10^500+ of them...).Chapter 5: Physics vs. Metaphysics: Physics wins! Or summat.Is there such a thing as objective reality? Yes! OK - I can agree with that. But I don't really understand when he starts trying to distinguish between types of objective reality. I mean, in science you get successive different theories of the behaviour of objective reality but that doesn't seem to be what is being discussed. It doesn't seem to be the old causality vs. indeterminacy chestnut, either. Colour me baffled - and not caring much, either.Chapter 6: Relation of QM to other sciences.Here Heisenberg seems to be groping after a coherent general philosophy of Emergent Behaviour without quite getting there; seems more in the Emergent camp than the Reductionist camp, anyway. One interesting comment is that biology requires physics/chemistry plus ""history."" The history allows for evolutionary theory by way of genetics. But one could view ""history"" as actually being emergent from physics by way of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, a connection he does not make.He also discusses the main theories of physics in relation to each other: Newtonian mechanics is an approximation to Special Relativity which assumes an infinite speed of light. It is also an approximation to QM assuming an infinitely small Planck's Constant. Thermodynamics can be understood as a statistical theory of particles and can be derived from either QM or Newton's Laws. But General Relativity sits there looking lonely and mean, yet beautiful, and defying all attempts to integrate it into any other aspect of physics as any kind of limiting case or emergent theory.The error regarding the description of QM experiments in terms of classical physics is repeated.Chapter 7: Relativity.Einstein's book will give you a clearer understanding of Special Relativity and the Principle of Equivalence but you will need to know some (school) algebra. On the other hand, that is a whole book about the same length as this one, not one lecture/chapter. A point re-iterated through out the chapters so far is the use by physicists of ordinary language in specialised ways. This is essential as it turns out that ""ordinary"" concepts like space and time, on closer examination turn out to be much more subtle and complex phenomena than is readily appreciated in daily life. I think one of the later chapters goes into this in depth.Heisenberg emphasises that General Relativity is not on a strong experimental footing; it wasn't then but it is now. Some of the cosmological questions raised have been answered, others haven't and recently new and even more freaky ones have been found.Chapter 8 seems (as far as I can tell) to come down to, ""Does the particle exist when you're not looking?"" Well, that question isn't any more answerable than the question in classical physics, ""Does that brick exist when you're not looking?""""Looking"" here means doing anything in order to verify the existence of the particle/brick. Assuming something doesn't exist when you're not ""looking"" is essentially Solipsistic/Cartesian and denied by the persistence of macroscopic objects.The Everett Many Worlds Interpretation hadn't been thought up yet, so isn't discussed. The main focus is on ""hidden variables"" notions.I'm getting impatient for this to be over...The remainder:A chapter surveying the contemporary state of sub-atomic physics. Of course, it's out of date. Most interesting now for it's speculation that the number of types of truly elementary particles will drop, possibly to one. What happened between then and now is that the number went up for some time, then dropped again as quark-theory was verified and recently went up by one again with the discovery of a ""Higgs-like boson."" Given the current experimental evidence/hypotheses/theories in cosmology, one would think the number will more likely go up rather than down in the immediate future.Chapter on language in science and physics in particular in relation to ""every-day"" language. Perhaps the most obvious pervasive theme of the book.Final chapter on the effects of modern physics and nuclear physics in particular on society at large and it's mode of thought. More interesting than almost the entirety of the rest of the book."
1,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3939397-martina,5,"This has got to be one of the most singular reading experiences ever. Ever. Heisenberg's book is so unusual, refreshing and unique - I'm not even sure on which shelf to put it. The funny thing is, this book is not so much about physics, or about philosophy, for that matter. Perhaps a more apt title would be The life and times of Werner H. It reads like a novel, and, in a way, it is a novel. I would call it a ""novelized autobiography"", for Werner talks about his life, his work, his thoughts in a series of episodes, referencing many political and historical events and famous persons he had a chance to meet. It's all written in a lively style, which is quite unexpected for someone who is deemed to be a great physicist of the 20th century (and physicists are supposed to have dull writing styles :P). As most people, I'm curious about the lives of people who had done something worthwhile. It's a benevolent kind of curiosity that drives one to ask questions about the person behind that big name; a person with likes, dislikes and quirks, a person who wasn't born with an innate knowledge of his or her discipline, but who had to work to get where he or she is at. And in that regard, Physics and philosophy is a great accomplishment, because we have a chance to get to know the real Werner Heisenberg. Not just the guy who founded matrix mechanics and gave the world the uncertainty principle, but a nature lover with a penchant for music, who had engaged in the works of a youth organization and who had no qualms whatsoever to work as a lumberjack just to alleviate the financial strain from his father. But all this information is more like a subtext of the book; Heisenberg, for the most part, concentrates on his studies and professional career, and doesn't talk about physics in a textbook manner. Rather, he talks about the problems that preoccupied him at the time, with just enough hints so that readers versed in physics know what he's saying, and that the laymen readers don't get bored. But for me, the biggest thing Werner accomplished with this book, is the portrayal of the zeitgeist in his country (in his youth) and later on in the world. No, I'm not going to romanticize the time he lived in. We all know about the gruesome things that had happened (time frame: Heisenberg was twelve at the beginning of WWI)... I'm referring to the general climate after the 1st World War. It was a time when people read more, played music together (by and by, Heisenberg was an excellent piano player), and were not afraid to dabble in things that weren't their specialty. Almost everyone had interests on the side, and pretty substantial ones - like reading philosophy books - and even young people were not shy to discuss their personal thoughts on this or that matter. I was amazed at how perceptive many of those young people were at the time (according to the conversations Heisenberg had relayed in the book). To make things even more exciting, it was a dawn of a new time, the birth of atomic and molecular physics, quantum mechanics, and relativistic physics. So it's not all together surprising that many of the scientists Heisenberg had encountered, even during his university years, ended up as Nobel prize winners. We meet a whole host of them throughout the book, and somehow, we get to know them as people, or at least Heisenberg's impression of them. His teacher Sommerfeld, and his university colleague Pauli; then Bohr himself, Einstein, Schrödinger, Dirac... Just reading about Werner meeting all these people (especially from today's perspective) is totally mind-blowing. It's true that Heisenberg had edited out a large quantity of ""physics talk"" with them, but he included other conversations which were not so much on philosophy, but more about life and beyond. Those conversation revealed much about the participants. They even managed to endear Niels Bohr to me, and by that alone, you can tell how persuasive Heisenberg's writing is! (view spoiler)[Just Niels' view on war, and Denmark really tugged at my heartstrings [i]*hangs head*[/i] (hide spoiler)] I also loved that we got deeper insight into Heisenberg's own thinking processes. His account on how he got to the groundbreaking idea of the uncertainty principle should be mandatory reading. (view spoiler)[Fun fact: at the same time, Bohr was on a skiing vacation in Norway, where he developed his complementarity idea. (hide spoiler)] The book is also incredibly witty, especially when Heisenberg paints humorous scenes. (view spoiler)[Those who know to what I'm referring: When Schrödinger visited Bohr in his home in Copenhagen (Chapter 6), they had heated debates concerning quantum mechanics that went on for days and nights. But when Schrödinger got down with fever from all those exertions, Mrs. Bohr made him tea, gave him cakes, and tucked him in bed, while Niels sat by his bedside, evangelizing his theories ""Surely you must see..."". Yeah, you know that scene, and so does my whole neighborhood. They could hear me laughing! (hide spoiler)] And it's chock full of memorable quotes; if I started to quote now, I would probably use up all my characters. If you have a chance to read this book, do it. You won't be sorry."
2,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10344594-austin-wright,4,"Physics and Philosophy by Werner Heisenberg ReviewPhysics and Philosophy is a book published in 1962 by Werner Heisenberg, a “giant of modern physics”, about the theory of Quantum Mechanics and its philosophical implications. This book is certainly best read with prior knowledge of some classical and some quantum physics. I actually read it knowing little or nothing about quantum physics, and the parts that described in detail the physics seemed technical and hard to understand, yet still i could make sense partly of most of it. But then I took a course in quantum cryptography and looking back at it it all makes well enough sense. So knowledge of physics is very highly recommended. As far as the philosophy goes i found it much easier to understand as he talks about high level concepts in ancient greek and renaissance thinking. If fully understood this book can really help to inform our perception of reality and how quantum mechanics has changed that. Forever we have imagined the world as objectively “real” that whether or not we observe something it is the same, that one thing must be in one single place at any given time, that time and space are infinitely divisible and constant. This book uses the proven theories of quantum mechanics and relativity to help break those notions on what reality truly is and it is this aspect of the book that i find most enthralling. It uses logic, experimental evidence, and facts to undermine objective reality and replace it with a weird, alien view of everything. This book is incredibly important more so for philosophers thank physicists because it breaks many core assumptions down and replaces them with new and strange, yet experimentally proven results that, taken to logical fruition, produce the likes of Schrodinger's Cat which is in a superposition of dead and alive, that is to say, both dead and alive simultaneously. It are these ideas that radically change the basis of much thought ever since the beginning of human history.I recommend this book only if you have at least a rudimentary understanding of some physics and algebra, and if you are open minded enough to question the very core beliefs of reality, because that can certainly be alot to fully grasp. Otherwise this book can seem very technical when it talks about physics, and strange about philosophy. But if you can understand and accept the statements made here then it is an absolute must read provoking some deep insight into some of the largest and most fundamental questions of reality. "
3,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"Heisenberg the famous Nobel Prize winner takes us through the building up of our current understanding of Quantum Reality and the physics that lead up to this. He gives a good discussion of the Uncertainty principle of which he is so famous for and how this will impact the future of physics and how we see the world. The title is misleading however, don't expect much philosophy out of this book, and of course it was written when many ideas of modern physics were not even hardly fleshed out yet. I think this makes it interesting to see where he though physics might go, and compare this to the current state. It makes you wonder what he would have though of the work going on in Geneva, and how he would have looked at some of the physics of today."
4,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1250249-amy,5,"Some Knots Have Knotted LimbsToward the end of Physics and Philosophy Werner Heisenberg presciently mentions the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with relativity and the need for coherent concepts that allow for both theories without mathematical inconsistencies. Today unified field theories of quantum gravity that attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity are being explored by physicists in proposals like string theory. Heisenberg also mentions that the physicists of his time were discovering elementary particles by experimenting with high-speed particle accelerators (which he calls “big accelerating machines”), referencing a machine in Geneva, what we now know as the operational Large Hadron Collider at CERN that is testing aspects of string theory by attempting to recreate conditions of the universe during the Big Bang. Heisenberg’s discerning comments about the future are not surprising given the intricate attention he pays to contemporary and historical conditions through contextualizing quantum mechanics in relation to everything from Einstein’s relativity—Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle rebuts Einstein’s notion that probability cannot be expressed in physical reality—to atomic weaponry to Western philosophical thought (Descartes, Berkeley, and Kant).Heisenberg relates quantum theory to the first conceptions of atomic science, starting with Thales, who says that water is the fundamental substance of reality. After Thales, Anaximander says the fundamental substance is ageless and eternal but nothing that can be known; his student Anaximenes says the fundamental substance is air. Heisenberg notes that Hereclitus’ argument for fire being the fundamental substance comes closest to his contemporary understanding of atomic science if only the word, “fire,” was replaced with the word, “energy.” It was Empedocles who shifted the debate from monism to pluralism by proposing the fundamental substance could not be one substance but instead the four basic elements. When Anaxagoras proposed that matter is composed of small seeds and that all change is caused by mixture and separation, he was just one step to the concept of the atom, which occurred with Leucippus and Democritus proposing that the smallest unit of matter is finite, eternal, and indestructible and that motion is made possible by the empty space between these units. Plato then articulated a theory of matter that combined Democritus’ atomism with the teachings of Empedocles and Pythagoras (who inspired schools of ritualistic Dionysian number theorists who took religious oaths to the tetraktys, the fourth triangular number of 10) to propose that the smallest units of matter are mathematical forms, about which Heisenberg comments, “here it is quite evident that the form is more important than the substance of which it is the form.” Like a poem?Describing his understanding of the structure of language, Heisenberg quotes from Goethe’s Faust, where Mephistopheles tells the student that while formal education instructs that logic braces the mind “in Spanish boots so tightly laced” and that even spontaneous acts require a sequential process (“one, two, three!”), in truth, “the subtle web of thought/Is like the weaver’s fabric wrought,/One treadle moves a thousand lines,/Swift dart the shuttles to and fro,/Unseen the threads unnumber’d flow,/A thousand knots one stroke combines.” In addition to the swift darts and unseen threads of the imagination science must also be based on logic, open to pattern and swerve. Yet Heisenberg acknowledges there is no adequate language for quantum theory, which suggests that any novel science must concurrently create a novel language—poems?—where a “thousand knots one stroke combines.”"
5,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16624009-mengsen-zhang,3,"ok. it's a great book. I'm giving three stars based on my personal experience with this book-- I do not fully understand his composition of this book. I have to ignore many passages to have a holistic impression of what he's arguing about.Based on what I understand, I would give this book another name: ""Language and Dispute: the evolution of human knowledge"". I would say it's more about language and reality rather than physics and philosophy. The most charming part of this book to me, is his analysis of the notion of ""matter"" (or atom, or the essence of objects) about how it evolves from ancient philosophy to classical physics and then to modern physics. He compared the representation of reality with mathematical language and natural language. The use of language is stabilized by the connection between words, but what a word itself is representing is very unstable (alright..uncertain if we like). As a description of the world propagates via linguistic representation, the abstraction and precision of the description becomes lost person by person, or generation by generation... until, some how, modern experimental apparatus widen the spectrum of events can be observed, and save the mental effort for people to achieve that order of abstraction. I also found the bonus read-on ""science and religion"" quite interesting. Especially the little story about the debate between Heisenberg, Dirac and Pauli over the relationship between science and religion (I love Pauli the most!). It is a miniature reflection of the book (most likely to be unintended). Apparently, among these three giants of quantum physics, there was a very *uncertain* representation of events by the word ""religion"" or ""God"". Some of them referred to a description of reality, while others referred to the utility of that description. And it is fun to see them arguing about the *symbols* rather the reality they each have in mind. "
6,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124325-anna-hiller,4,"This is really a book about physics that only lightly touches on philosophy. A good reason to read it would be to understand why it is that 20th century physics totally changed the world, something that I think is generally forgotten these days in spite of our (ab)use of technology, the prodigal wunderkind of the advances in science over the last 200 years or so. The thing to remember about Heisenberg's book is that it was written at the height of the Cold War, and therefore beneath the shadow of nuclear weapons... in fact, he states that right on page one. And so his conclusion with its conflicting apocalyptic/utopian possibilities for the future is very much a product of his time. Heisenberg's style is very indirect and hesitant, kind of surprising considering his prominence in the field. Altogether informative, if a bit dated. Lindley's introduction in the 2007 edition is fantastic, and makes up for the timewarp. "
7,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59794455-j-n-pastorek,5,"Certainly one of the most insightful book I have read this year.Heisenberg talks about the connection between quantum physics to other fields, mainly philosophy where he propagates hylomorphistic interpretation of quantum physics."
8,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Heisenburg traces philosophical thought from Greeks (permanence versus change; ultimate elements of reality) to Descartes (the partition of mind and matter) to Newton (classical physics/mechanics). These philosophical ideas have, Heisenburg writes, formed the way we see the world and the language we use to describe it.Heisenburg argues that ideas and language pertaining to the empirical world are not adequate to deal with the realities of quantum physics (ultimate reality as energy, out of which sub-particles are formed, the behavior of which can be determined only in terms of probability). Nor are classical descriptions adequate to deal with the realities of relativity theory (light as a universal constant; the stretching, contracting and linking of space and time; the equivalence of mass and energy). Heisenburg believes that the spread of science around the world can deepen and widen Western philosophical thought that confines our way of seeing the world. He is hopeful that new ways of thinking will also unify cultural differences and eliminate “arms” in the age of nuclear weapons. Based on what Heisenburg writes, the starting point for a new worldview might have energy as the ultimate reality,* that energy is motion,** motion creates counter motion, that such interactions are rearrangements of energy and matter; and that change and transformation is perpetual. Might this view have implications for our philosophical understanding? Are, for example, freedom (the movement of energy and matter; life’s free movement to seek objects of sustenance to temporarily overcome entropy); equality (balance and the elimination of energy/power differentials); and dialectical processes (movement, counter movement, balance) embedded in the physics of energy and matter?The Kindle edition was filled with many typographical errors and the introduction to the book was difficult.*“Energy is in fact the substance from which all elementary particles, all atoms, and therefore all things are made, and energy is that which moves. Energy is a substance, since its total amount does not change, and the elementary particles can actually be made from this substance.” **A question remains about the nature of motion – whether its source is external (gravitational effects in warped space-time; internal (atoms in motion; dissipation of heat), or both.

10,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46616940-oscar-despard,5,"This slender volume is a superb introduction to quantum theory, as explained by one of its discoverers. Heisenberg has aimed this discursive essay at the general reader, with the aim of explaining subatomic mechanics in natural language insofar, Heisenberg makes clear, as that may be possible. In doing so, he avoids the delight in obscurity that characterises some superficial descriptions of that theory; though this book stimulates the reader’s mind, it does not overwhelm it.Nevertheless, Heisenberg does not hesitate to elucidate the fundamental changes that modern physics necessitates in our engrained perception of reality. He explains without condescension how such ideas will interact with pre-existing cultures, and he graciously tracks the development of natural science through the centuries back to pre-Socratic philosophers, from the relatively prominent, like Demosthenes, to the more obscure, like Anaxagoras. His grace is equalled by his honesty. He acknowledges the flaws and benefits of Cartesian metaphysics, which allowed classical physics to flourish but is primarily responsible for the ontology that we must overturn to understand quantum mechanics. He also comments on the usefulness of the Kantian notion of the a priori status of Newtonian physics; he counsels against any hope to escape them entirely since they are the only basic concepts by which we can interpret the natural world. Therefore, he holds them to be in a sense a priori, in spite of the fact that their status as objective truth, and indeed the very idea that such truth is possible, has been toppled by his own uncertainty principle.Of course, his uncertainty principle is the startling discovery at the heart of this book, and he clearly refutes any classical reinterpretations of it, but he is very modest in his references to it. Apart from off-hand mentions of jokes made by Bohr, or disputes with Einstein, one could read this book without realising that its author had won the Nobel Prize, or in fact that he had articulated the principle of uncertainty that he so often cites. This decision not to mention details he deems unnecessary exemplifies the understatement and concision that characterise this book, which it would almost seem false to flatter by calling elegance. The pleasantness of the writing is underlined by its lack of pretension. Aware as Heisenberg is of the wider implications of quantum theory, he is also reluctant to claim too much for it. Nevertheless, his musings on the unification between atomic physics and chemistry, and on whether such a development is possible in biology, are well worth reading. If I am to avoid this review becoming as long as the book about which it is, I must conclude: This erudite essay succeeds in its stated goal of explaining the concepts of quantum mechanics to the general reader. It does so without direct use of mathematical symbols, a particular challenge for such a counter-intuitive area of science. It was a fascinating read that I would highly recommend to anyone interested and confused, which so often coincide, in the world described by quantum theory."

13,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104781119-william-bies,4,"The present work constitutes a German version, published in 1959, of the Gifford lectures Heisenberg gave in English at the University of St Andrews in Edinburgh, Scotland in the winter semester of 1955/56. It does not matter much whether he translated his lectures into German or wrote them originally in German but lectured in English, and kept the originals around for later publication; it is regardless clear that one can trace his thoughts more facilely in the German. This reviewer has, in fact, read the English printing of many of these lectures years before, but, although a good account of quantum mechanics and its history from the eye of one of its founders and indicative of some philosophical interest, they did not, at the time, hint at anywhere near the wealth of ideas and portentousness he was to discover in the German in what was then far into his future. There can be no doubt that, along with Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg must be counted as one of the two originators of the mechanics of the quantum who, in later life, distinguished themselves for their penetrating reflections on the deeper significance of this most surprising and counter-intuitive discovery of modern times, which first came to light innocuously (though not insipidly) in the late summer of 1900 with Planck’s formula for the spectral density of blackbody radiation—which was nothing more than an inspired guess—and, more perplexingly, by December in that year with his derivation of the same from the inexplicable quantum hypothesis. As a young man in 1913, Bohr astounded the world of physics with a similar feat through his quantum theory of the hydrogen atom. By 1925, Bohr himself was settling into his role as the elder statesman of the physics community when Heisenberg arrived on the scene as the first and most meteoric of the Knabenphysiker (as the more established professionals who knew the real empirical physics jokingly called them). As a result of Heisenberg’s brilliant leap of imagination, matrix mechanics came into being and would soon be strengthened with an empirical foundation through Pauli’s tour de force of calculational virtuosity. A few years later, early in 1927 once the new quantum mechanics had won general acceptance despite the impossibility of making sense of it all, Bohr announced his central concept of complementarity at a lecture at Lake Como. Heisenberg, who had participated in many strained late-night discussions with Bohr at his institute in Copenhagen, then the mecca for aspiring young physicists, and himself often wandered alone in the nearby park turning over their exchanges in his mind afterwards, was the one who translated Bohr’s lucubrations, which are legendary for their opacity and tortuosity, into a coherent account that everyone else could embrace, or at least provisionally entertain, and dubbed it the ‘Kopenhagener Deutung der Quantentheorie’. His retrospective Gifford lecture under the same name, in this reviewer’s judgment, makes for the most intriguing reading in the present collection. For a good coverage of Bohr’s own ideas as he would express them, this reviewer recommends The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr; Volume I: Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature and Volume IV: Causality and Complementarity, published in English in a modern printing by the Ox Bow Press (please refer to this recensionist’s comments in his reviews of these two volumes posted immediately preceding this one, which we need not repeat).After the second world war and Bohr’s regrettable early demise, Heisenberg became one of the senior figures of the physics community in Europe and burnished his credentials as a Kulturmensch by reflecting on the meaning of the quantum revolution with recourse to the great philosophical tradition. Some of the other entries in this collection attest to this. Another, not included in the present collection but perhaps this reviewer’s favorite, is entitled ‘Die Bedeutung des Schönen in der exakten Naturwissenschaft’ (it is reprinted in a Reclam edition in the Universal-Bibliothek). Erwin Schrödinger suffers by comparison. At the time of the young Heisenberg’s breakthrough, he was a middle-aged professor in Vienna who was proficient at applied mathematics and had some minor accomplishments to his name, such as his original work on the theory of colors. After his inception of wave mechanics, he did perform some demanding calculations (such as the Stark effect) and was the first to hit upon the significance of entanglement in his paper on the so-called ‘Schrödinger’s cat’, which is almost a trivial fact about Hilbert spaces of dimension greater than one but acquires the status of a difficult puzzle once it becomes relevant to physics in the quantum theory, but he seems never to have gotten over his initial, yet misguided, view of the wave theory as a continuum alternative to Bohr’s quantum jump and to have accepted either Born’s probabilistic interpretation of the wave function or the necessity of von Neumann’s collapse postulate in the theory of measurement.This reviewer remembers vividly, when he finally took up these lectures by the late Heisenberg, how pregnant with potential his musings struck him! It was as if he could peer into the mystery of the quantum world, which Bohr famously declared to be off limits. Could it be that the elder Heisenberg deciphered the ontology behind the wavefunction, otherwise treated by most physicists as but a convenient calculational device of at most epistemic value, and sought to describe how the collapse of the wavefunction can take place in a consistent fashion among multiple observers? The speculations that this momentary vision entrained are so strange as scarcely to be credited, but nonetheless very real as a prospective mode of human thought. One catches a glimpse of what, perhaps, Hegel saw as the march of objective spirit (Geist) and portrayed in his phenomenology. At least in his imagining, one could intuit intellectually how man can effect (in a sense best captured by the German verb ‘wirken’ with all its connotations) a dispositive change in the natural world. Is this not also what Fichte must have intended in his genial Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre of 1794, the founding document of German idealism, when he speaks of emergence in the reflection of the self-consciousness of a not-I opposed to the I and of their reciprocal determination, in which somehow the I gains the upper hand in equilibrium due to the fact that the I determines itself while the not-I only affects the I through causality, which confers on the former a certain priority? If understood correctly, for Fichte this grounds the subordination of theory to praxis and is responsible for his focus on ethics and natural right (Naturrecht) in his mature work. Granted, Fichte has an ineradicable tendency to solipsism and never deals adequately with the problem of intersubjectivity, which Hegel takes as his theme in his phenomenology of spirit of 1807 and subsequently treats with more systematic rigor in his philosophy of right. Fichte’s exposition of theoretical science in part two of his Wissenschaftslehre of 1794 in terms of a synthesis of reciprocal determination (Wechselbestimmung) between the I and the not-I, the former acting upon the latter through spontaneity and the latter acting upon the former through receptivity, needs to be replaced by a multisided mutual determination of I’s interacting among themselves in accord with intersubjectivity. Hegel’s definition of freedom in the phenomenology of spirit as ‘bei sich Sein im Anderen’ would suggest that Fichte’s problematic may find its satisfactory solution in Hegelian terms. One may doubt, however, whether Hegel succeeds in pulling off this feat in his Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts, although as ever Hegel’s meaning is quite difficult to plumb.Let us enter for a moment into Heisenberg’s own original ideas in greater depth. How do they connect to mathematical physics? For the measurement problem in the interpretation of quantum mechanics will not be settled until a more adequate formalism becomes available; until then, all we will continue to have will be but a perpetuation of today’s irresolvable standoff among competing schools. Two points strike this reviewer as being especially in need of theoretical elaboration. First, can a formula for conditional probability in the context of wavefunction amplitudes be made conceptually coherent? Right now, it is far from clear how the corresponding concept in classical probability theory and Bayes’ theorem would extend to the quantum realm. Yet, something like this seems to be a prerequisite to a full solution to the measurement problem. Second, is there an adequate notion of a weak measurement? For this is what occurs in the world of everyday experience. When I look at oncoming traffic before crossing the street, I do not place the car I see into a true position eigenstate, else its momentum immediately thereafter could be literally anything (were we to adopt an exceedingly naïve point of view on the formalism of orthodox quantum mechanics). What really happens, then, supposing we want boldly to insist on applying quantum mechanics to everything, since, as far as we know, the world is quantized at the fundamental level?The engaged reader will want to keep desiderata such as these in mind while poring over the excellent Gifford lectures reprinted in the present volume. What more insights into the future development of the theory of the quantum world have we yet to extract from the mature wisdom of this most original mind among the participants in the modern quantum revolution?"

15,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14911182-conner-houghtby,5,"I would like to quoto the final paragraph of this very insightful and compelling book: ""Coming now to a conclusion from all that has been said about modern science, one may perhaps state that modern physics is just one, but a very characteristic, part of a general historical process that tends toward a unification and a widening of out present world. This process would in itself lead to a diminution of those cultural and political tensions that create the great danger of our time. But it is accompanied by another process which acts in the opposite direction. The fact that great masses of people become conscious of this process of unification leads to an instigation of all forces in the existing cultural communities that try to ensure for their traditional values the largest possible role in the final state of unification. Thereby the tensions increase and the two competing processes are so closely linked with each other that every intensification of the unifying process--for instance, by means of new technical progress--intensifies also the struggle for influence in the final state, and thereby adds to the instability of the transient state. Modern physics plays perhaps only a smal role in this dangerous process of unification. But it helps at two very decisive points to guide the development into a calmer kind of evolution. First, it shows that the use of arms in the process would be disastrous and, second, through its openness for all kinds of concepts it raises the hope that in the final state of unification many different cultural traditions may lie together and may combine different human endeavors into a new kind of balance between thought and deed, between activity and meditation."" -From the 1959 editionI chose this lengthy (sorry) quote not because it is a fair summary of the topics listed in this book, but because it is a great example of how many of Heisenberg's keen insights are still incredibly relevant today.Physics and Philosophy covers generally the impacts of the theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics on the human conception of reality developed over the last few millennia.

In 1900, Max Planck discovered something strange and scary, that energy did not flow in a steady continuum, but was delivered in discrete packets Planck later called ""quanta."" What I think was the greatest discovery of all time, Quantum Mechanics (Theory) quickly replaced Newton's classical physics and attracted physics greatest minds from Bohr and Born to Pauli and Dirac.

He was a very confident and brash young man with great ideas that revolutionized the way we saw the world.

For example, it means that a quantum particle does not move along a well-defined path through space. An electron may leave place A and arrive at place B, but it is not possible to ascribe a precise trajectory linking the two. Thus the popular model of the atom, with electrons circling the nucleus along distinct orbits, is badly misleading. Heisenberg tells us that such a model can be useful in producing a certain picture in our minds, but it is a picture that has only a vague attachment to reality. (Introduction to the book by Paul Davies)2) The weakness of the Copenhagen interpretation is exposed when the question `What actually happens inside a piece of measuring apparatus when a measurement of a quantum particle is made?' is asked. The Copenhagen position is that one merely treats the apparatus classically; but if instead it is treated (more realistically) as a collection (albeit large) of quantum particles, then the result is deeply worrying. The same vagueness and indeterminism that afflict the quantum particle now invade the entire system. Instead of the apparatus concretizing a specific actuality from a range of potential possibilities, the combined system of apparatus + particle adopts a state that still represents a range of potential possibilities. To take a specific example, if the apparatus is set up to measure whether an electron is in the right or left half of a box, and to display this by throwing a pointer either to the right or left respectively, the end result of the exercise is to put the combined system into a state in which neither outcome is selected. Instead the state is a superposition of two states, one consisting of the electron and the pointer on the right, the other consisting of them on the left. So long as these two alternatives are mutually exclusive there might be no insurmountable problem, but in more general experiments there can also be interference between the alternatives, so that no clear either/or dichotomy is offered. In short, no actual measurement can then be said to have occurred. (Introduction to the book by Paul Davies)Note: He's talking about Many Worlds Interpretation.3) If the entire universe is the quantum system of interest, there clearly does not exist a wider macroscopic environment, or external measuring apparatus, into which quantum fuzziness can fade away. Most quantum cosmologists reject the Copenhagen interpretation, with its need for additional epistemological machinery, and prefer instead to take the quantum formalism at face value. This means serenely accepting the full range of quantum alternatives as actually existing realities. (Introduction to the book by Paul Davies)4) In quantum mechanics, somethings like position and momentum not just a function, they are also frequency and amplitude of some Fourier Expansion.5) A first and very interesting step toward a real understanding of quantum theory was taken by Bohr, Kramers and Slater in 1924. These authors tried to solve the apparent contradiction between the wave picture and the particle picture by the concept of the probability wave. The electromagnetic waves were interpreted not as `real' waves but as probability waves, the intensity of which determines in every point the probability for the absorption (or induced emission) of a light quantum by an atom at this point. 6) The error in the experiment does – at least to some extent – not represent a property of the electron but a deficiency in our knowledge of the electron. Also this deficiency of knowledge is expressed in the probability function.7) The observation itself changes the probability function discontinuously; it selects of all possible events the actual one that has taken place. Since through the observation our knowledge of the system has changed discontinuously, its mathematical representation also has undergone the discontinuous change and we speak of a 'quantum jump'.8) The measuring device deserves this name only if it is in close contact with the rest of the world, if there is an interaction between the device and the observer. Therefore, the uncertainty with respect to the microscopic behavior of the world will enter into the quantum-theoretical system here just as well as in the first interpretation. If the measuring device would be isolated from the rest of the world, it would be neither a measuring device nor could it be described in the terms of classical physics at all. 9) He does not accept revelation as such a basis nor does he want to accept uncritically what is perceived by the senses. So he starts with his method of doubt. He casts his doubt upon that which our senses tell us about the results of our reasoning and finally he arrives at his famous sentence: `cogito ergo sum.' I cannot doubt my existence since it follows from the fact that I am thinking. After establishing the existence of the I in this way he proceeds to prove the existence of God essentially on the lines of scholastic philosophy. Finally the existence of the world follows from the fact that God had given me a strong inclination to believe in the existence of the world, and it is simply impossible that God should have deceived me. 10) The position to which the Cartesian partition has led with respect to the `res extensa' was what one may call metaphysical realism. The world, i.e., the extended things, `exist.' This is to be distinguished from practical realism, and the different forms of realism may be described as follows: We `objectivate' a statement if we claim that its content does not depend on the conditions under which it can be verified. Practical realism assumes that there are statements that can be objectivated and that in fact the largest part of our experience in daily life consists of such statements. Dogmatic realism claims that there are no statements concerning the material world that cannot be objectivated. Practical realism has always been and will always be an essential part of natural science. Dogmatic realism, however, is, as we see it now, not a necessary condition for natural science. But it has in the past played a very important role in the development of science; actually the position of classical physics is that of dogmatic realism. It is only through quantum theory that we have learned that exact science is possible without the basis of dogmatic realism.11) Locke holds, contrary to Descartes, that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience. This experience may be sensation or perception of the operation of our own mind. Knowledge, so Locke states, is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas. The next step was taken by Berkeley. If actually all our knowledge is derived from perception, there is no meaning in the statement that the things really exist; because if the perception is given it cannot possibly make any difference whether the things exist or do not exist. Therefore, to be perceived is identical with existence. This line of argument then was extended to an extreme skepticism by Hume, who denied induction and causation and thereby arrived at a conclusion which if taken seriously would destroy the basis of all empirical science.11) But are synthetic judgments a priori possible? Kant tries to prove this by giving examples in which the above criteria seem to be fulfilled. Space and time are, he says, a priori forms of pure intuition. In the case of space he gives the following metaphysical arguments: 1. Space is not an empirical concept, abstracted from other experiences, for space is presupposed in referring sensations to something external, 48 and external experience is only possible through the presentation of space. 2.Space is a necessary presentation a priori, which underlies all external perceptions; for we cannot imagine that there should be no space, although we can imagine that there should be nothing in space. 3.Space is not a discursive or general concept of the relations of things in general, for there is only one space, of which what we call `spaces' are parts, not instances. 4.Space is presented as an infinite given magnitude, which holds within itself all the parts of space; this relation is different from that of a concept to its instances, and therefore space is not a concept but a form of intuition.  If we wanted to know why the a-particle was emitted at that particular time we would have to know the microscopic structure of the whole world including ourselves, and that is impossible. There-fore, Kant's arguments for the a priori character of the law of causality no longer apply.The theory of relativity has changed our views on space and time, it has in fact revealed entirely new features of space and time, of which nothing is seen in Kant's a priori forms of pure intuition.12) Kant says that whenever we observe an event we assume that there is a foregoing event from which the other event must follow according to some rule. This is, as Kant states, the basis of all scientific work. In this discussion it is not important whether or not we can always find the foregoing event from which the other one followed. Actually we can find it in many cases. But even if we cannot, nothing can prevent us from asking what this foregoing event might have been and to look for it. Therefore, the law of causality is reduced to the method of scientific research; it is the condition which makes science possible. Since we actually apply this method, the law of causality is `a priori' and is not derived from experience.13) What Kant had not foreseen was that these a priori concepts can be the conditions for science and at the same time can have only a limited range of applicability. When we make an experiment we have to assume a causal chain of events that leads from the atomic event through the apparatus finally to the eye of the observer; if this causal chain was not assumed, nothing could be known about the atomic event. Still we must keep in mind that classical physics and causality have only a limited range of applicability. It was the fundamental paradox of quantum theory that could not be foreseen by Kant. Modern physics has changed Kant's statement about the possibility of synthetic judgments a priori from a metaphysical one into a practical one. The synthetic judgments a priori thereby have the character of a relative truth.14) Kant had pointed out that we cannot conclude anything from the perception about the `thing-in-itself.' This statement has, as Weizsacker has noticed, its formal analogy in the fact that in spite of the use of the classical concepts in all the experiments a nonclassical behavior of the atomic objects is possible. The `thing-in-itself' is for the atomic physicist, if he uses this concept at all, finally a mathematical structure; but this structure is – contrary to Kant – indirectly deduced from experience.15) Bohr's Interpretation ruins the symmetry between position and velocity. Bopp's Interpretation ruins the symmetry between particles and waves. It is shown that mathematical scheme can interpreted not only quantization of particles but also quantization of 3-dimensional waves. You can tell there is absolute space and time in SP because of hidden parameters but this ruins symmetry between space and timme in Lorantz Invariance. Hidden parameters for QM are also like that.16) In his presentation Alexandrov overlooks the fact that the formal-ism of quantum theory does not allow the same degree of objectivation as that of classical physics. For instance, if the interaction of a system with the measuring apparatus is treated as a whole according to quantum mechanics and if both are regarded as cut off from the rest of the world, then the formalism of quantum theory does not as a rule lead to a definite result; it will not lead, e.g., to the blackening of the photographic plate at a given point. If one tries to rescue Alexandrov's `objective effect' by saying that `in reality' the plate is blackened at a given point after the interaction, the rejoinder is that the quantum mechanical treatment of the closed system consisting of electron, measuring apparatus and plate is no longer being applied.17) Copenhagen interpretation by the introduction of the observer. Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the `possible' to the `actual,' is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory. At this point quantum theory is intrinsically connected with thermodynamics in so far as every act of observation is by its very nature an irreversible process; it is only through such irreversible processes that the formalism of quantum theory can be consistently connected with actual events in space and time. Again the irreversibility is – when projected into the mathematical representation of the phenomena – a consequence of the observer's incomplete knowledge of the system and in so far not completely `objective.'18) Among the remaining opponents of what is sometimes called the `orthodox' interpretation of quantum theory, Schrodinger has taken an exceptional position inasmuch as he would ascribe the `objective reality' not to the particles but to the waves and is not prepared to interpret the waves as `probability waves only.' In his paper entitled `Are There Quantum Jumps?' he attempts to deny the existence of quantum jumps altogether (one may question the suitability of the term `quantum jump' at this place and could replace it by the less provocative term `discontinuity'). Now, Schrodinger's work first of all contains some misunderstanding of the usual interpretation. He overlooks the fact that only the waves in configuration space (or the `transformation matrices') are probability waves in the usual interpretation, while the three-dimensional matter waves or radiation waves are not. The latter have just as much and just as little `reality' as the particles; they have no direct connection with probability waves but have a continuous density of energy and momentum, like an electromagnetic field in Maxwell's theory."

Even better: new mathematical descriptions of particles can be verified by experience to be correct.

30,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4465582-alexander-curran,5,"“What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” ― Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern ScienceAt the dawn of the 20th century when quantum physics was born; the founding fathers of this scientific revolution were delving deeply into philosophical consequences of the new physics in terms of existence and physical reality (ontology). The reality perceived through the laws of classical physics provided strong challenges to quantum reality and human knowledge of quantum physical concepts (epistemology). In addition, the theory of relativity, which also came into existence at a similar conjecture, changed the concept of space and time (the relationship to matter, + concept of gravity) radically from the existing knowledge of Newtonian physics. In this book, physicist Heisenberg gives a brilliant account of physical reality after reviewing the works of notable philosophers like; Kant, Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. The reader gets to read the physical and philosophical analysis via one of the founding fathers of quantum physics using both classical and quantum physics. His philosophical ideas are summarized below:Physical theories had to be proposed speculatively and pursued deductively with respect to their many consequences that can be put to theoretical and experimental verifications. It turns out that the theory makes more physical and philosophical assumptions than the facts alone imply. The assumptions could be ontological or epistemological in nature. For example, the concept of space and time (and its relation to matter) is independent of the observer, which would be ontological in nature since the subject matter of scientific knowledge is independent of the perceiver (consequences of relativity). The nature of quantum physics introduces indeterminacy to nature of things which would be epistemological since the experiment performer (and knowledge-seeker) influences the subject matter (the outcome his experiments) by his physical observation. The state of a quantum object is undetermined until an observation is recorded. Hence, the author's argument is that the potentiality is a part of physical reality. Einstein's contention was that the potentiality, probability or chance is due to epistemological limitations of our knowledge in knowing the entire picture, the Omni-complete, and hence misapplied to the object itself. The Omni-complete object is omniferous, omnifarious, omniparous, omnipotent and omniscient and therefore the concept of chance or probability is inappropriate in the description of a real object. Both Einstein and Heisenberg admitted that the experimental data does not lead to concepts of physics, and hence the object of scientific knowledge remains unknown, but it is known through the theoretical constructs or axiomatic postulation verified indirectly by experiments and its deduced consequences. To find the object of scientific knowledge one must go to the theoretical assumptions of a physical law; the concept of probability and chance figures into the definition of the state of a physical system (due to statistical nature of things, and also use of statistical analysis in understanding the results of an experiment) in both classical and quantum physics. In quantum physics it also figures in the subject matter, but not in classical physics. This is the major difference between two disciplines that separated Einstein from the Copenhagen school of thought. Heisenberg suggests that the concept of potentiality very much a part of subjective reality contrary to classical reality.The probability function represents a mixture of two things, partly a fact and partly our knowledge of a fact. An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons (wave) moving around the nucleus; from the classical standpoint it is difficult to conceive how an electron orbit around the nucleus without changing its energy. Then again the electron is a wave until detected; therefore the energy is constant as long as it stays in the same orbit. The second point is that the act of determining the position becomes a measurement problem since light quanta is absorbed during its detection and the electron is displaced (change its position) to a higher electronic state. Thus the space-time description of the atomic events is complementary to their deterministic description. The probability function obeys equations of motion as in Newtonian mechanics; its change in the course of time is completely determined by the quantum mechanical equation, but it does not allow a description in space and time. The observation, on the other hand, enforces the description in space and time but breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by changing our knowledge of the system. The mechanism and the results of an observation of atomic events can be described in classical concepts, but the deductions from observations results in probability functions which combines the statements about possibilities with statements about our knowledge of facts. Therefore we can not completely objectify the results of an observation. What happens between an observation and the next depends on the way we observe or on the fact we observe. This becomes subjectivism. Since the probability function combines objective and subjective elements. It contains statements about possibilities or better tendencies (""potentia"" in Aristotelian philosophy), and these statements are completely objective, they do not depend on any observer, but it contains statements about our knowledge of the system, which of course are subjective in so far as they may be different for different observers. In ideal cases the subjective element in the probability function may be practically negligible as compared with the objective one.“Whenever we proceed from the known into the unknown we may hope to understand, but we may have to learn at the same time a new meaning of the word 'understanding.” "

Published first in 1958, one can perhaps understand the reasons for Heisenberg to write such a book, to explain and clarify some of the most commonly-held misconceptions about a theory (his theory) that was still considered too radical and unintuitive by classical physicists at that time. The format of the book (without mathematical equations or notation) suggests that it was meant for a layman or someone not well-versed in quantum mechanics. However, almost a century since its discovery, quantum mechanics is now well-established and no longer a mystery. Hence reading this book in 2018 seems, at times, to be too tedious. I could no longer relate to the author's attempts at hammering out intricate and subtle details about the theory, details that aren't intricate and subtle anymore, but quite apparent. I hadn't imagined it to be such a long read, but it was. But my viewpoint is perhaps biased by the fact that I have studied the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, and hence, some of facts seemed over-elaborated. However, I do hope others find it a good read."

Most of his chapters read like an erudite scholar’s summary, yet there was more than a little uncertainty (no, not his famous principle) about how much good the quantum theorists were bringing into the world. It all seems to be kept at arm’s reach, the bombs and fascism each of their discoveries made somewhat possible. Yet it was an awesome flip to have the postscript feature so much of the mischievous Mephistopheles Pauli sharing his thoughts on mathematics and religion’s relationship to science. The last word, at least in this edition, is given to Bohr but evidence enough that all these physicists had a lot more racing around in their minds while their fingers accumulated chalk dust each time they slowed down to provide evidence of their thoughts. Just strange that these same Heisenberg hands don’t get as inky when it comes to explaining such mysteries in popular press books."

More accurately, it leans toward the philosophy side a bit more than tackling the scientific actions in the aforementioned field. In one point in the book, it shows you how some of the ancient philosophy is connected with modern physics. In my opinion, this point is the most interesting point in the entire book. The reason being is that one, for someone who knows very little about philosophy, may not imagine that such ancient wisdom is still somehow valid after the huge leap in science. My 4-star review is because I sensed some issues with the writing. They imposed a few difficulties in getting the main idea quickly. This also may be related to the fact that I am not a native English speaker and the fact that philosophy is not the easiest subject to comprehend for someone like me, usually far away from such topics. That said, I feel the editing part could be better. "

A basic knowledge of quantum physics and relativity is not sufficient to understand the book. There is more of history of philosophy than the philosophy itself in the book. Moreover, it is clear that Heisenberg has soft side for ancient Greek philosophy, and he makes deliberate effort to show its analogy with quantum physics, which I think was quite inane. The most important takeaway from the book is - the interaction of object under study, experimental setup and rest of the universe, which forms the basis of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It does provoke a thought - do we live in an objective or subjective reality? And, a fair amount of discussion is done on this point."

Having studied physics at university, I can attest to the greatness of his contributions in the sphere of science. What I didn't realize until after reading this book was how much he contributed to the philosophy of epistemology and ontology. One is staggered by the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the position held by Heisenberg and Bohr. As you'll find out in the reading, this way of thinking is so revolutionary in regards to the classical mindset and is still felt in the scientific community today.I urge that all who are interested in physics, philosophy, or scientific history to read this, for it is groundbreaking and stands the test of time.Recommended to those who live the absurd life."
36,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Existence and physical reality according to physicist Werner HeisenbergAt the turn of 20th century when quantum physics was born; the founding fathers of this scientific revolution were thinking deeply about the philosophical consequences of the new physics in terms of existence and physical reality (ontology). The reality perceived through the laws of classical physics provided strong challenges to quantum reality and human knowledge of quantum physical concepts (epistemology). In addition, the theory of relativity, which also came into existence at about the same time, altered the concept of space and time (consequently their relationship to matter, and the concept of gravity) radically from the existing knowledge of Newtonian physics. In this book, physicist Heisenberg gives a brilliant account of physical reality after reviewing the works of notable philosophers like; Kant, Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. You get to read the physical and philosophical analysis of one of the founding fathers of quantum physics using both classical and quantum physics. His philosophical ideas are summarized below: Physical theories had to be proposed speculatively and pursued deductively with respect to their many consequences that can be put to theoretical and experimental verifications. It turns out that the theory makes more physical and philosophical assumptions than the facts alone imply. The assumptions could be ontological or epistemological in nature. For example, the concept of space and time (and its relation to matter) is independent of the observer, which would be ontological in nature since the subject matter of scientific knowledge is independent of the perceiver (consequences of relativity). The nature of quantum physics introduces indeterminacy to nature of things which would be epistemological since the experiment performer (and knowledge-seeker) influences the subject matter (the outcome his experiments) by his physical observation. The state of a quantum object is undetermined until an observation is recorded. Hence, the author's argument is that the potentiality is a part of physical reality. Einstein's contention was that the potentiality, probability or chance is due to epistemological limitations of our knowledge in knowing the entire picture, the Omni-complete, and hence misapplied to the object itself. The Omni-complete object is omniferous, omnifarious, omniparous, omnipotent and omniscient and therefore the concept of chance or probability is inappropriate in the description of a real object. Both Einstein and Heisenberg admitted that the experimental data does not lead to concepts of physics, and hence the object of scientific knowledge remains unknown, but it is known through the theoretical constructs or axiomatic postulation verified indirectly by experiments and its deduced consequences.

Right from the genesis of quantum mechanics Heisenberg dives into his famed uncertainty principle and correlates the aspects of knowledge with the different philosophical systems of erstwhile era as espoused by Aristotle, Plato to the modern philosophers like Kant, Hegel etc. Heisenberg even touches ontology and explains so very lucidly how constraints in our natural language and terminology act a barrier in understanding some of the terms in relativity and quantum mechanics which result in laymen not appreciating the science and the implications of such sciences. It was so very joyful to read. "

Heisenberg didn't use the word paradigm once! The third chapter actually reminded me of Tao of Physics, just swap out European mysticism with Eastern.Most of the rest was summary of topics I've read entire books about, such as relativity. Where it really came together was the final chapter. His take on the two levels of belief is really useful."

Heisenberg's take on philosophy seems to be just as authoritative as his insights in physics. A solid 5. Though it must be said that some pre existing knowledge on Quantum Mechanics and Relativity should be had otherwise, the book can be slightly difficult, given that it isn't written in the most easiest manner.

50,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7336012-samuel,3,"About 400 years have passed since the dawn of the scientific method. Is physics coming to an end? Are we doomed to live in a weird reality without a fundamental understanding, as suggested by relativity and quantum mechanics? The Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as has been called, explains the results of quantum mechanics as follows. Take a particle, an electron. From a classical point of view, when we are not observing the electron, it should still exist and have a certain position and velocity, even if nobody/anything is interacting with it. Quantum mechanics states that we cannot talk about a position or velocity when we are not observing the particle. Not ""observe"" in the sense of ""a biological being looking at something"", but rather any object, from the classical point of view, interacting with it. The terms ""velocity"" and ""position"" make sense to us in classical physics, but do not make sense when applied to quantum systems before measurement - only after measurements we can talk about ""position"" and ""velocity""; but even then, we cannot know both parameters with arbitrary accuracy - that is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. As one of the founders of quantum theory, Heisenberg stresses out that the unsatisfactory conclusions of the theory are enhanced by the fact that there is a philosophical divide between ""the observer"" and ""the thing observed"". As stated by Descartes: the ""res cogita"" vs. ""res externa"", which makes it difficult for us to accept the conclusions of quantum mechanics, and lead us to think that something must be wrong with the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (since then, many interpretations have been formulated).I don't think this is the case. Surely, there are numerous psychological and philosophical barriers which might prevents us from accepting the weirdness of the reality we live in - but I believe that the impact of ancient philosophy (particularly ontology and epistemology) is minimal, mainly nowadays. It doesn't seem like physicists are clinging to old patterns of thought - on the contrary, they seem to be ready to adopt radical different perspectives on how nature works. I don't think we are looking for a philosophically-pleasing interpretation - but I might be wrong (I hope I am wrong, because that would imply the existence of some unexplored territory).[A brief comment about on the book: it's not particularly well written, but makes for it by the huge amount of food for thought. Many of the issues addressed are solved nowadays (we already have a quantum model of weak and strong nuclear force interactions), while others, such as gravity, are unresolved at the quantum level.]Dogmas are the only thing I see dying; not physics. If so, let them die. But I am a layman in physics and if I am wrong, and physics is indeed dying, it might be the case that nature is beyond our comprehension. I'm okay with that - it's still fun to imagine."
51,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51361098-becky-shattuck,5,"Physics and Philosophy gives only a brief overview of the history of science that led to quantum physics. I expected it to have a larger explanatory component, but, instead, it offered more of a review. Without the appropriate background knowledge, it's impossible to proceed through this book and understand the science Heisenberg uses as the basis for his philosophical arguments. At a few points in the book, he struggled to explain concepts without the use of mathematics, and I wondered why he didn't then just use mathematics where it was necessary and appropriate. I think it would have helped a lot in understanding some of the history he briefly covered. It seems odd that he wasn't concerned with readers' scientific background, but he was concerned with the sufficiency of their mathematical background.In this book, he covers a wide range of ideas that aren't limited to science. In addition to a solid background knowledge in atomic physics, I think his readers really need a basic understanding of the history of philosophy to understand a lot of his points. I felt like I would have missed a lot of ideas if I didn't have at least a little education in philosophy. He didn't just discuss arguments made by Kant and Descartes. He also discussed Greek philosophy, from the first idea of the concept of an atom to Plato's cave. He argued that human understanding of truth used to be based on thought, and it's since moved to a more scientific approach that requires empirical evidence. He later touches on the idea that even our scientific outlook has changed over time to one that focuses more on applied science.Heisenberg's philosophical arguments were fun to work through. I felt like I needed to suspend my belief in my known reality and logic to understand some of the dilemmas he discussed. At times, it all felt absurd; at other times, our existence in the world seemed absurd. In the end, the book is exactly what it claims to be; it's concerned with both physics and philosophy. Yet, it wasn't what I expected at all. It took me a lot of time to work through it, but, thankfully, I feel like I was able to gain more from it than just a headache."
52,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5970760-page-quinton,0,"Heisenberg's historical account of the progression of thought in both physics and philosophy operates, at least in my eyes, as a means to illustrate his understanding of what exactly science is. The information presented in reference to the historical developments in both science (of course most notably physics, given the topic of the text) and philosophy tended towards that of an introductory text. Though for me this added a repetitive nature to some of the essays, it allows the text to be more accessible to those not as well versed in either arenas of thought. This of course should not dissuade those with a more advanced knowledge from reading the book. Throughout the presentation one is able to see some definite opposition to naive realism.This is not to say that Heisenberg is arguing for some anti-realist view only one that allows for some form of subjectivity, specifically for phenomenon in the quantum arena. Such should come as no surprise given the discovery he is most famous for, that of the uncertainty principle, which in simplistic terms asserts that all observations (A.K.A measurements) effect the thing being observed. The consequence of such is that our scientific knowledge is a knowledge of the world as it unfolds itself to us through our means of inquiry. The closed systems of thought that scientists formulate, from Newtonian mechanics to Quantum theory, highlight different connections present in our surroundings. Of course this is only a summary, a very poor one at that, much more elaborate explanations can be found throughout the text, intermixed with the historical overview. Lastly I would like to point out by far the most interesting discussion that takes place, that of language and its role in science. The issue trying to explain Quantum mechanical phenomenon with classical terminology was of great entertainment. Specifically the discussion of developing a quantum logic form from which to create a language appropriate for Quantum theory."
53,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"Here is Heisenberg's main account of the development of the quantum revolution and its, in some sense, standard interpretation (which he built in the Copenhagen infatuation). He presents the implications and the connections of the advent of quantum mechanics, and to a lesser extent of relativity theory, to modern thought and society. He is almost obsessed with the observation, which dates to Bohr in fact, that common language as we are endowed by daily experience is no suitable to describe unambiguously the quantum realm, so that in any case one as to retreat into the mathematical formalism and rely on its proved agreement with experiments. He defends the Copenhagen interpretation against all criticisms, including those of Bohm and of Einstein among the several. He particularly repeats on the intervention of the observer in the experiments concerning reality, so that a new description is conceptually required. And he is able to put all matter in a nice philosophical perspective, starting from presocratic scientists through Socrates, Plato, Aristotile, Descartes, Kant till modern physics. It may be dated today, but it is at least a well-written and well-thought apology."
54,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,4,"This work is an interesting historical window into the philosophical crisis caused by quatum thoery. Having come to academic maturity well after quantum mechanics was thoroughly formulated I've never had the crisis of philosophy presented here: as a student the duality of nature was presented as mathematically elegant description of how nature works and it didn't occur to me then any more than it occurs to my students today that this somehow subverts the tenants of natural science. Given the statistical nature of thermodynamics, which one typically learns before quantum mechanics, it hardly seems surprising to students today that yet another aspect of the universe can only be described in terms of probabilities.Clearly, however, it was a philosophical crisis for Heisenberg and the others who introduced the theory in the first place. The chapter on the language of science is particularly interesting in explaining the shift from radical idea, to accepted mathematical explanation of how the world works. I think any scientist would be well served to read this work and ponder how quantum theory fundamentally changed the underlying philosophy of what natural science is."
55,0141182156,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5335505-jason-britt,4,"This is the most challenging book I have read in many years. The physics, by definition, I think, are unfathomable, and I do not have the physics knowledge to even begin to understand much of what Heisenberg describes. Though I understood the philosophy better than the physics, I am very much a novice in that field as well and clearly do not have Heisenberg's grasp of metaphysics and epistemology. Even with these challenges, I found myself engrossed in this book. It has served as an inspiration to me to learn much more about both fields. My hope is to be able to come back to this book again with a better knowledge of quantum theory, relativity and metaphysics.I found especially profound the observation that the basic building block of the universe has been discovered, and it is energy. This seems very obvious after the fact but had never occurred to me. With more contemporary reading, I am curious to learn how or if quantum theory has changed since Heisenberg wrote this in the mid-20th century."

Sometimes when discussing engineering or physics it's easy to get bogged down on the details of one particular area, but after reading Heisenberg describe the relationships between Newtonian mechanics, the theory of heat, electricity and magnetism, and quantum mechanics, I have a much better understanding of how to understand what to even work on in the first place. Understanding how the big picture subjects interrelate allows us to predict where the next breakthrough will occur and then focus our attention there. After describing these four topics in physics, Heisenberg then relates them to chemistry and biology. These handful of pages in the book provided quite a bit of clarity for me. Great book."

Heisenberg discusses the problems with the ""hidden variables"" interpretation, though at the time of his writing the conclusive Bell argumentation was still in the future. Also the ""Many Universes"" interpretation was still something to come. Interesting is to read the text in the light of the strong threat of nuclear war at the time, and his discussion of the role of physics in making human extinction a distinct possibility. All in all a nice read. I feel I will need to reread this a few times to pick up more of the content."

My continued my studies into quantum mechanics and general relativity only strengthened this desire. Heisenberg's book meets that need. He presents a fine survey of the history of philosophy as it relates to the physical world and a survey of the amazing finds in physics during the early 20th century. The discussion of the impact, particularly of quantum physics, is quite insightful. The father of quantum mechanics is certainly qualified to discuss the impact of uncertainty, too say the least."
