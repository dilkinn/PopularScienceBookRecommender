0,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,3,"How To Tell If You’re a HorseI remember seeing, perhaps 30 years ago, a chart of a design for an artificial intelligence computer programme by academic engineers at a university somewhere in Texas. The chart showed an enormous logically ramifying hierarchy of various sorts of events, experiences, and actions which their computer was intended to understand. Everything that the engineers could imagine happening was included somewhere in a sort of organisational chart of existence. At the very top of the chart was a single box that stood for exactly that, existence itself. From that box, the designers had drawn an upward facing arrow pointing to a word without a box:. ‘REALITY.’ The Stuff of Thought  brought back memories of that AI chart. ‘Reality’ is something that Pinker refers to frequently as that which keeps language on the straight and narrow: “ The tethering of words to reality helps allay the worry that language ensnares us in a self-contained web of symbols.”  Like the AI designers, Pinker has a little arrow that points out of language, to something other than language to which language is tied. But also, just like the AI designers, the only thing Pinker’s arrow actually points to is... well another word.Pinker doesn’t like the idea that words, language, have a life that is only loosely and unreliably connected to that which is not-language. He does recognise that ‘reality’ is an awkward thing for a linguist to talk about:  “[T]he nature of reality does not dictate the way that reality is represented in people’s minds,”  he says. So, according to this logic, despite our conviction that the world consists of more than human minds, it would be impossible to determine what reality is except by consultation with other minds. How does Pinker arrive at such a confused place?Pinker likes to be very precise in his semiotic descriptions and examples. But not when it comes to this business of reality. For that he plays fast and loose, conflating semantics (the connection of words to things that are not-words), syntactics (the relations among words and the ways in which they can be used with each other), and pragmatics (the effect that words have on human behaviour, including what and how words are used) into a very imprecise theory of language. He knows that only words define other words, that these definitions slip and slide continuously in the way they are used with each other, and that their effects on human activities are consequently uncertain in many critical situations. Yet he says:  “The logic of names, and of other words that are connected to events... allay these concerns [about misidentifications and falsehoods] by anchoring the web of meanings to real events and objects in the world.” If only it were so. At any given time much of what we refer to as reality simply doesn’t exist (the sun doesn’t actually rise; the moon doesn’t shine). Quite aside from the casual use of everyday language, when we try to be very precise about what we mean, we find ourselves in a pickle about reality. For example, for centuries Isaac Newton’s gravitational ‘action at a distance’ was an important scientific ‘thing.’ Turns out it never was anything at all except a phrase used by scientists. Now we say that what we see astronomically is all down to relativistic time-space distortion. Perhaps in resolving the contradictions of quantum physics, we will find that time-space distortion isn’t a thing either. That AI arrow, in other words, points not toward somewhere ‘out there’ but something ‘in here.’ Most probably what is in here is a residual religious hope that the universe is as orderly and benign as our cultural legacy says it is. So we can, and frequently do, have serious conversations about absolutely nothing. We accept the possibility of an ontological faux pas with reasonably good grace. Yet we worry constantly about the somewhat lesser linguistic sin of ‘error,’ either accidental or intentional, which is the subject of epistemology. Here we are culturally proud of ourselves that the ‘scientific method’ can ultimately sort out the factual core from the fictional chaff of any assertion and that through unrelenting ‘objectivity’ we can distinguish Trump’s lies from his covfefe’s (it seems safe to presume all his statements are somehow defective). Pinker calls this philosophical realism in the sense that people  “... are tacitly committed, in their everyday use of language, to certain propositions’ being true or false, independent of whether the person being discussed believes them to be true or false.” But this sort of realism gets sorely tested to breaking point more and more frequently. Beliefs about Trump, climate change, Russian assassinations and cyber-attacks, abortion, as well as my neighbour’s intentions regarding the shaping of our shared hedge, to name just a few examples, are beliefs held by many as true or false without a fact in sight. Assertions about these topics tend to be true or false precisely because they are believed not because they can be proven. Facts emerge as a matter of faith. Epistemology is, consequently, as political as any other investigation. Interests - personal, material, psychological, familial, religious, reputational - are a dominant force in any attempt to connect words and things. That’s just the way it is. And the way it is is being demonstrated as I write in the impeachment trial in the US Senate. Trump’s innocence or guilt is a purely political conclusion, as indeed is every ‘fact’ provided by any investigation, criminal, civil, scientific, or corporate.This is distressing to some people including Pinker. Bertrand Russell’s famous quip,  “I am firm; you are obstinate; he is pigheaded,”  is the epitome of the politics of language. It seems too obvious to need saying but apparently it does need saying yet again: Reality is nothing more (or less) than a transient political consensus about what constitutes facts. And facts are those assertions which, at least for the moment, are not contradicted by any other facts. And just as no one is quite sure what they mean by ‘scientific method,’ no one is any wiser about what constitutes the definitive rules of language and how to tell fact from fiction - except through politics. So Pinker is certainly right to suggest that the language we use discloses our model of reality. In fact it is our model of reality tout court (his analysis of verbs in shaping thought is exemplary).Reality is the elephant in Pinker’s rather elegantly laid out phenomenological room of language, however. There are a multitude of lovely linguistic furnishings, the erudition of extensive research lines the bookshelves, quirky incidental knowledge is apparent in the quaint knickknacks strewn throughout, and there are even quite a few saucy paintings on the walls. And all this is set off by a veritable Aubusson carpet of lucid and witty prose. But right in the middle of that carpet sits an enormous turd of that which is not-language. The odd thing is that Pinker put it there. He could have written about the quaint vagaries of (mostly English) language semantics and its implicit politics and left it at that. But by insisting on this strange thing he calls reality, a deus ex machina of absolute rationality, he leaves a strange smell around his entire enterprise. I wish I could remember the names of the AI engineers. I’d send them a copy asking them where they think Pinker’s arrow should point.I am also reminded of an important Yiddish saying which might have originated with Isaac Breshevis Singer but I can’t be sure. It sums up the politics of reality nicely, and shows where the arrow really points: ‘If one person calls you a horse, ignore him. If two people call you a horse, look in the mirror. If three people call you a horse, YOU'RE A HORSE.’"
1,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"It is remarkable how much of modern thought can track its genetic heritage back to Kant. When I studied Kant at uni I was told that there was an entire school of philosophy that was formed on the basis of a poor (mis)translation of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason into English. I always liked the idea of that. It is also nice to hear someone talking about Kant and not talking about ‘the unknowability of the thing in itself’ – often the only bit of Kant anyone knows. One of the things Kant sought to do in his philosophy was to find a way out of the endless debate (war?) between Empiricism (knowledge comes from experience) and Rationalism (knowledge is innate and logic eternal). Kant rejected both of these views and sought a compromise. He put forward that we had to have already existing structures in our minds that allowed us to frame the world and thereby understand it – these already existing structures – a priori categories he calls them – are the lenses we use to bring the world into focus.This is much the same as Chomsky’s view that we learn language because we have evolved mental pathways that make learning language easy – if not virtually inevitable. Pinker is perhaps the greatest populariser of Chomsky living today. His earlier books – particularly The Blank Slate (ironically titled this, despite him arguing against notions of blank slates) and How The Mind Works - are virtually treatises on the victory of nature over nurture. As such these two have been my least favourite of his books. As a recovering meliorist I still struggle with ideas that fix human nature quite as firmly as I feel Pinker – and oddly enough, even Chomsky – would seem to require it to be fixed.All the same, his other books, and large parts of this one, make me wish I’d become a Linguist. There is a long and amusing – well, I found it amusing, anyway – discussion about sexual intercourse and the various ways one can refer to it. Basically there are two ways – a series of ‘polite’ forms: they were intimate, made love, (or my current favourite which my daughter told me tonight) they had a marital embrace. (Sorry, I’ll need to pause for a moment while I stop laughing).The other way one can refer to sex is somewhat less polite. Without using any words that will require asterisks, these might involve verbs such as 'to rut' or 'to nail'. Okay, they are clearly less pleasant than 'to make love' or 'to engage in marital embracing' – but what I liked most about this was his explanation of why one lot are polite and the others less so. Pinker points out that all of the polite forms are intransitive verbs (verbs that don’t take an object and so the act 'just happens', rather than being done) whereas the impolite forms are all transitive – one person does something to someone else. So, I shagged her – is going to be impolite. Now, isn’t that interesting?There was also a long discussion in the middle about a book I read a couple of years ago called Don’t Think of an Elephant - I really didn’t think too much of that book at the time. It all seemed a bit simple-minded to me - a bit like an advertising man getting into politics. So I was very surprised to see so much space devoted to it here. I think Pinker is right – it is not enough to ‘reframe the debate’ and I also think there is a reality below the fluff of political debate that eventually asserts itself - frame or no frame. One thing you can say about Pinker is that he has many more thoughts per page than your average book. The fact that I don’t agree with everything he says is hardly a criticism compared to the pleasure I get out of reading him. Sometimes he makes me smile, sometimes I can't help laughing out loud."
2,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1719442-jen,4," ""Knowledge, then, can be dangerous because a rational mind may be compelled to use it in rational ways, allowing malevolent or careless speakers to commandeer our faculties against us. This makes the expressive power of language a mixed blessing: it lets us learn what we want to know, but it also lets us learn what we don't want to know. Language is not just a window into human nature but a fistula: an open wound through which our innards are exposed to an infectious world."" It has taken me three months, or thereabouts, to read this book. In an early status update I commented that this book was like a dense poundcake; the going was delicious but slow. That should probably be my whole review, but I am going to go on. Gird thyself. This book did indeed let me learn what I wanted to know. The chapters on metaphors, naming, and the taboo were incredibly interesting and insightful. Why isn't rape a taboo word, when the word that represents my genitalia is? How is it possible that the Morning Star and the Evening Star represent the same thing? What curious cerebral happening allows us to come to better understanding through metaphor and analogy? The book also let me learn what I didn't want to know, which mostly involved words that have -ing attached to them....the author's exuberance for verbs seemed to culminate in an almost orgasmic manner: ""Our trip down the rabbit hole has taken us to a semantic wonderland. We encountered a lush profusion of verbs- a dozen verbs of emitting substances, twenty verbs of changing the aesthetics of a surface, and no fewer than sixty-nine verbs of manner of speaking."" (!)It was during those passages that Pinker took on the voice of the count from Sesame Street in my head...""Crinkling! One verb! Crumpling! Two verbs! Screeching! Three verbs! AHAHAHAHA!""But perhaps Pinker would argue with me, in fact, I know he would. He argues with everyone! And he mostly wins, which makes him a genius in the field of linguistics AND a world class smartass, which makes me want to smack him over the head with his 499 page work. There are a few things I don't think he is fair about- and one of those things is religion (Surprise!) He makes this statement: ""The earthly representatives of God would just as soon preserve the belief that he (God) does listen and act in matters of importance, and so are unhappy about people diluting the brand by invoking God as the muscle behind their small time deals. Hence the proscriptions against taking the name of the Lord in vain."" Now, Pinker can say that this is how it is being used now,and he might even be right, (the smartass!), but it is wrong to assume that that is THE very reason that it was written down thousands of years ago. Pinker does this quite a bit- smacks down a topic or a rival linguist's theories and then uses the ""hence"" or ""of course"" and ""obviously"" to draw the reader to a conclusion that makes sense, but might not really be fully true or able to be conclusively proved to anyone but Pinker. He is a linguist, after all, and who can blame him for using his masterful command of language to explain, sway, discuss, or provoke- doing so butters his bread and gets him all ""verbingly"" excited. Did I just make a new word? I think I did! Curl my hair and color it gray and call me Pinker! 4.5 stars for the Pinkerman from me, the coiner of ""verbingly"", and the mistress of nothing in particular "
3,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"It’s hard to review this book. The book starts off to look too heavy with a long chapter on verbs. If you think verbs are simple things that are classified into transitive and intransitive, you’re in for a big surprise. The chapter is named Down the Rabbit Hole after how Alice ended up in Wonderland. And the world of verbs is quite a Wonderland. This chapter can seem a bit too technical and tedious unless you really love language. There’s a chapter about the relationship between language and intelligence. Is intelligence possible, or even meaningful, without language, or is it a slave to language? Fascinating theories there. Another chapter is on how causality, time, and space are represented in language, and how this representation affects our understanding of these notions. More fascinating stuff. There are more chapters on metaphors, names, profanity, and indirect language. All intensely fascinating stuff. Steven Pinker is a genius, yessir!Pinker wants to show what language – words, their meanings, constructions, and how they’re used – can teach us about human nature. Except for the discussion on Nativism vs. Pragmatism (whether mental representation of word meanings are innate or not) he stays clear of the nature vs. nurture debate. In the course of the book, we do encounter a lot of insight into human nature based on language. It may seem obvious if put abstractly, but language, being the most prominent thing that separates us from other animals, do say a lot about what we are. I think the chapter on swearing by itself should qualify this book for some grand prize. "
4,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497452-jennifer,2,"DNF: Have you heard of top-down learning vs. bottom-up learning? If not, top-down learners prefer to see the big picture before the supporting details can become meaningful, whereas bottom-up learners like to build the big picture by first understanding the details. I am a top-down learner, and this book is written for the bottom-ups.This book’s subtitle is “Language as a Window into Human Nature,” and that’s what I kept waiting for. Pinker spent a lot of time on details such as how “in a palm” suggests a hand curvature, whereas “on a palm” suggests hand flatness, and after 140 pages of that...ugh. I bought this book after reading a Japanese translation that gave details of how images combine differently to create specific characters of their language. It got me wondering whether using different symbols for communication affects how we see the world.It turns out that language is more a result of innate thinking, development, and a response to our environment, rather than the other way around - at least as of 1/3 of the way through.The latter chapters look interesting. But, I tried skipping and felt lost without the prior points. Pinker at least talks to me as an equal."
5,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,2,"I am a big fan of Steven Pinker. I think he's a very smart man, and a great advocate for science and reason in the public sphere. In interviews, he's witty, informed, and able to make concise points about a vast swath of intellectual topics. His book The Blank Slate had a very significant impact on me when I read it in late 2011. I had just finished a teaching credential program and was unsure about my next step in life; one of the only things I knew I wanted to do for sure was to read and self-educate as much as possible. The Blank Slate helped me understand psychology via methods I didn't encounter in my undergraduate philosophy classes, and pointed me in directions that would further integrate my love of philosophical inquiry with a more scientifically-informed perspective. Pinker is famous for being polemical and is often disparaged by conservatives and liberals alike, but I typically find his opinions to be well-reasoned and as responsibly middle-of-the-road as possible. Even so, my respect for Pinker was not enough to guide me contentedly through this book, which I generally found repetitive, esoteric, and––worst of all––boring. Though he has suffered much criticism for his flouting of traditional psychological theories and the pleasure he seems to take in prodding people toward revisiting their foundational ideas and values, I actually think Pinker is at his best when he has a bone to pick. If I had to identify just one reason why this book didn't work for me, it would be that Pinker doesn't have anyone to argue against––no unifying target on which to set his intellectual sights. There are a couple minor exceptions to this, the first of which is Pinker's advocacy for the theory of conceptual semantics, which he posits as superior to extreme nativism, linguistic determinism, and radical pragmatics (all of which Pinker portrays as rather extreme positions, possibly falling into straw man territory). In another chapter, Pinker challenges Johnson and Lakoff's theory of metaphor with varying success, making a few good points but also portraying their theory as far more relativistic than it truly is. These are interesting but not hotly controversial arguments, and neither provides the kind of overarching strength that would provide the book with a firm thematic backbone. The rest of the book is essentially a group of loosely related chapters that all center around the idea that ""language is a window into human nature""––a claim I can't imagine anyone trying to refute. So while this might represent the side of Pinker who is more concerned with responsible scholarship in his particular field of study rather than shaking things up in town square, I didn't find the premise intriguing enough to explore with much enthusiasm. This book also reminded me why I studied philosophy instead of linguistics. Past a certain point, I just don't care enough about the intricacies of language. When I feel like the conversation has traveled away from pragmatic explications of how language helps or hinders people and toward abstruse descriptions of grammatical and speech constructions, I begin to check out. To be fair, Pinker does include many examples of how such rules can be relevant to the lives of normal people, but over the course of the book I wasn't convinced that most of the topics were adding anything significant to my understanding of people's relationship with language. This disappointment is probably my fault more than Pinker's. I've read many popular science books over the last few years, so I was already familiar with much of his research, some of which was probably cutting-edge when the book was first published in 2007. However, many of the insights found here would no longer be considered news to anyone with a passing interest in modern psychology. As a result, the information that was new to me almost exclusively had to do with obscure linguistic theories I'd never heard of, and I finished the book feeling like there are probably many good reasons for that. Much of the first half felt like repeated instances of Pinker saying gleefully: ""You can do this with language, but you can't do that! And it's all because of this: (insert recondite linguistic theory here)!"" This approach sent me spiraling into inanition, and also opened the way for an additional problem: Pinker occasionally comes off as being imperialistic with language rules in a way that excludes the important contributions of poets and creative writers, who often work very hard to challenge or reformulate traditional methods of usage and structure. There are definitely some strong points to be found in these pages. Pinker includes many visual aids that helped me understand some of the finer points of grammar that have eluded me over the years, which made me wish such aids were more widely used in junior high and high school classrooms. Ironically, sometimes an image is a better vehicle for explaining a language construction than language itself. He also offers some good information about why early exposure to linguistic conventions is so crucial in developing the basic tools for success in modern education. In my experience, this is especially important when the time comes in adolescence for young people to start formulating their ideas using academic concepts, abstract language, and advanced argumentation. Finally, the second to last chapter provides salient (if not exactly solution-based) explanations of why people have such a difficult time with directness, causing us to create all kinds of elaborate ways to communicate without having to take full responsibility for the possible negative outcomes of our intimations to others. This is an important issue in social life, but I was dissatisfied that Pinker didn't offer many thoughts about how we can overcome this problem; he seemed more concerned with justifying why it is okay for people to avoid being open about their motives and desires. I'm not naive enough to advocate for complete honesty all the time, but I think our social lives would improve immensely if we consciously developed new linguistic and behavioral mechanisms for being upfront about what we want from ourselves and others, while still allowing a safe space for people to give potentially disappointing responses to our entreaties. It's a tough project, but one with potentially huge gains for quality of life. I wonder if Pinker would agree. I'm sure this is a great book for the right kind of reader. For those who don't enjoy Pinker's snarky side, this would perhaps be a better choice than one of his works in which he seeks to subvert what he perceives as unfounded popular beliefs or sentiments. This is in no way a book rife with objectionable claims or disingenuous scholarship––it's just not my cup of tea."
6,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,3,"A loquacious look at language.“Semantics is about the relation of words to thoughts, but it also about the relation of words to other human concerns. Semantics is about the relation of words to reality—the way that speakers commit themselves to a shared understanding of the truth, and the way their thoughts are anchored to things and situations in the world.”“If adults commit adultery, do infants commit infantry? If olive oil is made from olives, what do they make baby oil from? I a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian consume? A writer is someone who writes, and a stinger is something that stings. But fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce, hammers don't ham, humdingers don't humding, ushers don't ush, and haberdashers do not haberdash...If the plural of tooth is teeth, shouldn't the plural of booth be beeth? One goose, two geese-so one moose, two meese? If people ring a bell today and rang a bell yesterday, why don't we say that they flang a ball? If they wrote a letter, perhaps they also bote their tongue.”Interesting at points—though not as quite as I'd hoped—and periodically a total slog."
7,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291009-alex,4,"The Stuff of Thought succeeds where his last book, The Blank Slate, failed. Here, Pinker largely abandons the heredity vs. environment debate for a discussion of the mind itself, and what role language plays in human thinking. Drawing from Immanuel Kant, who first proposed the concept of a priori cognitive frameworks of time and space (so-called ""pure intuitions"") in his Critique of Pure Reason, Pinker argues that the human brain comes equipped with an innate understanding of certain fundamental attributes of the world like matter, causality and duration. Over the course of evolution, we developed basic preset cognitive models that allow us to navigate reality, tell past from present, evaluate volume, and square the perceived world with the self that perceives it. This runs counter to Wittgenstein's belief that thought is the slave of language. Rather, Pinker suggests, our core knowledge of space, time and identity precedes our knowledge of the words that represent them. How those words and their usage come to reflect our inborn predilections of the world is the subject of the book. This is a tremendously ambitious undertaking, and Pinker for the most part rises to the challenge with clarity and gusto. As a non-linguist, I am severely handicapped in my ability to verify or contest his many assertions, but as a language enthusiast I found his evidence compelling and his investigation enthralling. Consider his opening example. On the morning of September, 11th, 2001, a hijacked plane crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, causing a deadly explosion killing thousands. Seventeen minutes later, a second plane crashed into the South Tower, incinerating more still, and within an hour an a half, both buildings were reduced to heaps of toxic rubble. By any standard, what happened in that small window of time changed the world. But of all the heavy themes and loaded issues debated by scholars and pundits in the years since, Pinker hones in a single, deceptively complex question: how many events took place on the morning of 9/11—one or two? Initially, the question seems so trivial as to be offensive—the reduction of a calamitous tragedy to a piddling cardinal distinction—but follow Pinker's thread a bit further and one finds oneself in a turbulent theoretical sea, light years away from ""mere"" semantics. What constitutes an event? What do we mean by cause? These concepts, to say nothing of ordinality, intention, continuity, being, and force are constants in the human mind—atomic units of comprehension—and Pinker exhaustively yet effortlessly analyzes how these irreducible meanings manifest themselves in the ever-shifting matrix of grammar and lexicon. As it turns out, many of these analyses turn out to have dramatic real-world consequences, such as whether or not a president should be tried for perjury due to a particular use of tense, or how much insurance companies must dole out to their clients on the basis of what determines a single event versus two separate events. (In the case of the World Trade Center attacks, this meant the difference between 3.5 and 7 billion dollars.)Not that the book is without its flaws. All along, one can't help sense the author's half-assed attempt to atone for the hostility he's exhibited towards the arts in the past (for instance, his famous dismissal of music as ""auditory cheesecake""), and his awkward inclusion of familiar quotations and stock literary allusions comes off as amateurish and not entirely genuine. Does he really hold Shakespeare, whose vocabulary he once deemed inferior to that of modern third-graders, to be singularly capable of distilling profound psychological insights into mellifluous verse? Or is he just throwing a bone to his critics?The second half is also markedly less inspired than the first, and indeed actively disappointing. Linguistic factoids and etymological myth-bustings abound. Pinker chooses to spend a great deal of time on baby names, among other things, analyzing why certain trends arrive and depart when they do. My God, who cares? In the hands of Bill Bryson, such digressions might be worthy of a reader's attention, but here they feel like empty Gladwellisms, trivial observations dressed up in zippy anecdotes and cute funfacts. Uneven though it is, The Stuff of Thought generates enough escape velocity to merit a place among the strongest and most original works of popular science in recent memory. Not since The Astonishing Hypothesis, in which Francis Crick dismantled the longstanding myth of Cartesian Dualism, has a single work managed to elucidate such a mysterious and controversial realm, wedged as it is between cognitive science, philosophy of mind, neurology and evolutionary psychology.""I've never met anyone who isn't interested in language,"" wrote Pinker in the introduction to his 1994 bestseller, The Language Instinct. Too often, though, that fascination is squashed by pedantic grammarians bemoaning the degradation of standards on one side and pious sociologists extolling the virtues of primitivism on the other. The Stuff of Thought should provide an antidote."
8,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165589-gwen,1,"A friend gave me this book. I didn't like Pinker's other one and I don't like this one. This isn't a knee-jerk reaction from a sociologist; socio-biological explanations are generally examples of people reading their own interpretations of the social world, and how it ""ought"" to be, back into ""history"" and saying that it's natural. The arguments themselves are contradictory--men evolved to be promiscuous and sleep with any woman, except they also evolved to not sleep with ugly women. So they'll sleep with anyone to spread their seed, but not take a chance of impregnating a less-than-attractive woman? Huh. Interesting."
9,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164060-justin,4,"Great expose of how the mind can be exposed through the semantics and structure of language. I was bogged down my the technical aspects of verbs and grammar towards the beginning of the book but the second half really hit its stride as Pinker explains metaphors, the need for taboos, expletives and indirect language. A worthwile read for those wishing to learn more about humanity and the illogical quirks that make us interesting. Most importantly, the purpose of education is revealed. Not to convey concepts in alien and unrecognizable form but to package concepts in a way that inspires original thought while relating ideas to past experience. Ideally we can educate people to compensate for the fallacies induced by normal brain operation. A noble and explicit goal for the teaching structure of society. Perhaps we are trapped in the cave that is the mind but every so often we have a book that shines some light in that cave. The Stuff of Thought is one of those books."

Books like this are too rich and complex to give a half-assed review of, or one where I just write clever anecdotes about my life and vaguely tie them to some idea in the book, like a blog entry beneath a book, awaiting your votes. Not that anyone actually does this around here..."
11,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Steven Pinker is as close to a famous linguist as we have today (Noam Chomsky doesn't count, because he's famous for his politics, not his linguistics). He is also a clever writer, willing to think originally about deep topics, and to say unconventional things about them. Here, he more or less says that when you understand how language works, you have figured out how human thinking works. He seems to think it has a lot to do with verbs. He also spends an entire chapter (50 pages long) telling us how to use profanity with correct grammar.It's a bit odd. He points out that all of the impolite verbs for sex (f*ck, scr*w, sh*g, etc.) are transitive verbs, while all the polite verbs for sex (have sex, make love, sleep together, have intercourse, copulate) are intransitive. How could we explain that people who don't know the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs, make sure to use transitive ones for sex, but only when used as profanity?It's the sort of odd things that linguists discover: patterns in how we use language, that we follow without knowing. This is very different than ""don't end your sentence in a preposition"", the kind of rules which are broken more often than not. These are rules which a poorly educated blue collar worker who considers the very word ""grammar"" to be effete, much less the concept, will nonetheless follow, and make fun of anyone who doesn't. Try saying 'they made f*ck together', or 'sex you!', and you will find that they take the rule of transitive vs. intransitive seriously.We don't spend the whole book on this, but it's an eye-opener, and not only because if this book ever becomes a PBS mini-series they would have to skip the whole chapter. It's because Pinker's basic proposition is that the way our grammar rules work (in English and in other languages) is a clue as to how our brain works. We study language, what it does and (perhaps more importantly) doesn't do, to see how concepts are manipulated in our brain.Which is all fairly abstract stuff, and Pinker does a good job of finding concrete examples to keep our interest. Why is it that 'Steve' (and variations such as Stephen) went from being 75th in popularity, to being so omnipresent that Stephen Pinker admits to getting some extra sales because Stephen Hawking, Steve Jobs, and Stephen Jay Gould all gave the name some extra cachet? If you try to bribe a maitre d' at a trendy New York restaurant to get seated early without a reservation, how often will it work (answer: nearly always, but not if you say what you want too plainly)? There are also a fair number of comic strips, especially from the series ""Robotman"".Pinker's book is not to be read late at night in bed; this is a 'sit up straight and pay attention' kind of book. But he's a gifted writer with sympathy for those among his readers who haven't spent half their waking life pondering verb tenses, and he makes us laugh as often as furrow our brow. If language is the stuff of thought, this book is the best kind of language, that makes you think better and more deeply about topics like space, time, causality, free will, and the Seven Words You Can't Say on TV. Highly recommended."

13,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208681-magdelanye,4,"SP seems to be a fan of reality, of the everything-is-explicable,not-a-problem type.He is so good at what he does (explaining how come and how) that it becomes beside the point to disagree. In pointing the reader to the trap door of language theory and even holding it open, he is the perfect tour guide.Following along his inexorable logic,the reader can easily forget this, forget even his or her own position and the fact that,although the guide is especially friendly and attentive,that's all part of his job, and he works for the company after all.The first part of the book is devoted to methodologies of classification and functional delineations of linguistic habit. SP minimizes the impact of language on thought and credits our urge to communicate with the fact that we do manage to convey quite precisely some of what we actually think.The whole issue is complicated by the fact that, even if we do possess the capacity to think beyond words, without words we cannot express our thoughts. Our feelings, yes, can be conveyed by a gesture or a groan. And body language certainly transcends all language barriers. SP takes the postion that our reasoning and our logic are influenced more by cultural and environmental constraints than by language. At the end of this book,as much as I enjoyed and even learned from it and regardless of his persuasive arguements, I have come to the conclusion that I am in a different camp. ""Left to our own devices, we are apt to backslide to our instinctive conceptual ways."" he laments towards the end. I can't help but think this might be a good thing. Other chapters investigate the power of names and the ubiquity of metaphor. SP asks provocative questions. Where do the meaning of words live, in the world where we find the things we are talking about? Or in our head,where our understanding resides? People need some concept in their heads that corresponds to the words used. How then do we accomodate new concepts? The same word can carry quite different meanings just as regularly as different words can describe the same person, activity, or thing. The words we choose convey more than just description but also where we stand, unless we are dissembling to save face, perhaps, or to keep our options open. The great role of innuendo as social glue is examined in its full spectrum. This was not an easy book but I do recommend it for anyone interested in the development of the thinking process as well as for those interested in language and communication."
14,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67550-liz,5,"I love Steven Pinker. LOVE Steven Pinker. But I also think Linguistics is the Best Thing Ever. So I loved SP's book ""The Language Instinct"" (even though a lot of it was old news to me, since I was fresh off of my linguistics course), and I was super-stoked for this one. Well, the first couple of chapters were not that great. But things totally picked up after that! Once his focus widened from strictly the brain to the influence of language on culture, the type of things that were detailed became way more interesting (and amusing!).If [Lakoff] is right, conceptual metaphor can do everything from overturning twenty-five hundred years of misguided reliance on truth and objectivity in Western thought to putting a Democrat in the White House.The Doors' song ""Love Me Two Times"" sounds strange at first, because the temporal phrase x times applies only to events, not to states, and loving someone is a state. Of course, we are meant to interpret the verb as a euphemism for having sex, which is an activity and an accomplishment (sometimes in more ways that one).And a wee shout-out to my buddies from Texas: The social psychologist Richard Nisbett has noted that societies with a ""culture of honor,"" where affronts must be quickly and sometimes violently redressed, are often extremely polite, because an unintended insult can escalate into a duel or a feud. [I have also read that this is the case in prison.] The American South was historically a culture of honor, and Nisbett, a native Texan, recalls that his first impression on arriving at Yale as a freshman was that everyone seemed to be really rude."
15,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763581-megan,2,"This book presented some interesting ideas on how language is shaped by the way we think, and how it enables us to think in new ways, but ultimately i found it to be too academic, like attending a long lecture by a Harvard professor, which the author is. But others may have more patience with it, especially if they don't read it while recovering from a head cold. My favorite sections talked about how new words and metaphors arise and how names come into and out of fashion, as well as how we selectively use direct or indirect, ""polite"" language, including cases where obscurity of meaning or openness to interpretation is helpful such as in international diplomacy. "
16,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,2,"Science, like art, opens our eyes to what is in front of us. But unlike art, which honors transcendence and promises infinity, science measures what is observable and defines what is finite. Neuroscientists tell us that the possibilities are not limitless. The equipment we are given performs specific functions. We can adapt our brains to tasks unrelated to these functions, like reading, but this kind of ‘neuronal recycling,’ as Stanislas Dehaene calls it, still makes use of the same old brains.I think Steven Pinker is transmitting the same message in ‘The Stuff of Thought.’ That ‘I think,’ will serve as a general qualifier for everything that follows, because Pinker’s message is often buried in his relentlessly verbose prose. If one example would serve to make a point, you can be sure that’s not where he will stop. Pinker is one brainy dude, so perhaps the problem is with my own intelligence. He avoids jargon, and throughout ‘Stuff’ self-effacingly makes fun of his own tendency to ramble on and on (and on and on). But those self-induced chuckles are pretty much self-indulgent, because they fail to dam an overwhelming onslaught of logorrhea.So if I missed what he’s really trying to say, that’s the way it goes. I’m relieved to have finished the book. One limitation on our brains, on the way we think, is how we think—in words. Language, Pinker finds, is based on conceptual constructs that are not mathematical or scientific. We make meaning that is ‘very different from the analogue flow of sensation the world presents.’ We don’t measure space ‘in smooth coordinates like those revealed by rulers, protractors, and surveyors’ levels.’ We use a ‘mental cartoon of pushing and resisting’ that is laden with emotion and concerned with saving face. Pinker summarizes these linguistic constructs in the final chapter of ‘Stuff,’ ‘Escaping the Cave.’ If you want the gist of the book’s thesis, reading this chapter would be a quick way to do so. Yes, that cave is Plato’s and language is the shadow on the walls. We can perhaps start to break out, though, with Pinker’s version of neuronal recycling—inventing new ways of using language through metaphor and combining our words in new ways. In other words, through art.But we will still always bound by what we are, which is expressed in the language we speak and in which we think. Pinker refuses to completely throw out the genetically determined ‘universal grammar’ of his progenitor, Noam Chomsky. In the nature vs. nurture, innatism vs. tabula rasa, debate, Pinker leans toward nature, but his position—that of a conceptual semanticist—is rather carefully nuanced. He outlines that position in a chapter called ‘Fifty Thousand Innate Concepts’ by contrasting it with other linguistic theories.Those theories are placed on a continuum that has Jerry Fodor’s ‘extreme nativism’ at one end and radical ‘linguistic determinism’ on the other. An extreme nativist holds that the language we use for thought is totally predetermined. A radical linguistic determinist argues that our thoughts are completely determined by the language we invent. If I’ve got it right, the conceptual semanticist says, now let’s be reasonable, our thoughts are based in a given structure that we’ve extended to include new ways of thinking. I found this chapter to be the most valuable in the book because it gave me some grounding in the current prevailing wisdom of linguistics, even though following the reasoning of linguists can be as painful and convoluted as the following the reasoning of philosophers. Dang it, give me some nuts and bolts, I say. Some clear explanations and practical advice. And less laundry lists.The most entertaining chapter is ‘The Seven Words You Can’t Say on Television.’ Pinker’s nerdy obsessiveness and self-deprecation (as well as his love of dirty jokes) suits his discussion of why one word for an object or an act can be acceptable, while another one is taboo, and how excrement has trumped sacrilege in shock value (at least in English). For the most part, however, that nerdy obsessiveness weighs down ‘The Stuff of Thought’ to the point where I wanted to tell Pinker to stuff it."
17,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/853659-frankie,5,"Stunned. I've never read a book so packed with new revelations and well-researched, referenced ideas. The text moves at breakneck speed, elucidating every corner of my pitifully thin familiarity with linguistics and logic. There are myriad illustrations, statistics and studies that support and ease readability. From describing the way children learn sentence structure, showing by their cute mistakes how infant speech can help us trace the language of time, space and causality; to the surfacing of the metaphor and just how much metaphor lends to nearly every expression (the ""metaphor metaphor""); to the faddish cycle of baby names as the layman's dominance over making new words; to the great chapter on taboo language (Carlin's ""7 Words You Can't Say on Television"" and more); and finally to the absurd but necessary use of indirect language. The concepts are astoundingly simple at heart. I don't know where to begin citing my favorites, but two should be enough.The first epiphany I experienced on page 183, as Pinker describes how the concept of moving through space affects 2 and 3 dimensional ideas of shapes. As in ""...why we say that something can be underwater or underground even though it's surrounded by, not beneath, the water or the ground. It's because water and ground are conceived as 2-D surfaces, not 3-D volumes..."" The idea took me by surprise when I imagined something buried in the dirt on the ocean floor as only then literally ""underwater,"" and something being ""underground"" is quite impossible (depending on your definition of ""ground"").Another concept I enjoyed was the logic fable on pages 419-420 called the ""Barbecue Sauce Problem."" I'll paraphrase. 20 people meet for dinner and eat ribs. 3 of them get sauce on their face. There are no mirrors, and no one wants to be rude and point out the messy eaters, plus no one with even a clean face is sure if they have sauce on their face either. So no one wipes their face. the host comes in and solves the problem. ""At least one of you has sauce on their face, I'll ring the dinner bell once for each person that does."" He rings the bell once and no one moves. Twice, and no one moves. The third time he rings the bell, the very 3 who have messy faces immediately wipe their faces.I never figured this out until the author explained it, but I'm sure you can. I don't want to spoil it for anyone ruminating right now. Comment if you wish to know.When I first sat down to read this book, I thought it might be a rough ride filled with difficult to grasp allusions at best. Something like reading Baudrillard. Pinker, however, drives his points with repetitive and humorous ease, with jokes, puns, cartoon clippings and examples. The chapters climb in complexity, bringing even the most distracted reader into his insightful take on language as a whole."
18,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,3,"If I were rating this book based on the first 4 chapters, it would get two stars. The rest of the book deserves 4 stars, so I'm meeting in the middle.The first four chapters were, from my perspective, painful, drawn out descriptions of linguistics material more appropriate for a Linguistics 101 textbook than a popular book. Although sometimes these culminated in quite interesting points, Pinker often took dozens of pages to say what he could in just a few. The early chapters, in fact, contained only a few major points that are really central to highlighting the way language can give us a glimpse into human nature. I think these points could have easily been made without throwing dozens of linguistic concepts at the reader, particularly the terminology. Perhaps knowing the terminology is a great party gag for some, but I for one don't ever expect to use most of that information again. Most of the points in this portion of the book, where interesting, were more ""huh, isn't that neat?"" rather than really revolutionary or central to the theme of the book. the chapter in which he debunked other linguistic theories was really not essential to the rest of the book, and if he wanted to include it, it could have gone in an appendix. My advice to readers who find themselves annoyed or uninterested in the first few chapters is to skip ahead to chapter 5. You won't miss anything that is necessary for understanding the rest of the book or understanding his thesis.Once you get the chapter on metaphor, this book gets interesting. Linguists never tire of discussing metaphor, it seems, but I really enjoy reading about it. So many of our expressions are metaphors, whether we realise it or not, and that is a really interesting when you consider what that might tell us about the human brain. The chapter on swearing was also brilliant, particularly for me - someone who doesn't see why people are so offended by profanity. While I had to convince myself to sit down and actually read the first half, I found myself looking forward to picking up the book again when I was reading the second half. Considering the book's theme of ""language as a window into human nature"", this is where I actually think Pinker provides a winder and provides some rather interesting points to ponder. A lot of what he does is to point to things that are quite obvious once he's flagged it, but as a native speaker of english (and member of the human race), you never thought about before. Sure, most of these things aren't completely universal - which I think makes language a rather imperfect medium through which to explore the nature of humanity more generally - but many of them are nearly so, and that makes them all the more fascinating. "
19,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"Too wordy, too many examples, too much narrative, too much that is a retelling of what is known. I just couldn't find a focus, a significance, to all the interesting stuff. Readable, but not memorable. The intro. & epilogue would have been enough for me... except for all the references in the epilogue that weren't explained, but only allusions to stuff mentioned in earlier chapters. I dunno, maybe if I were less distracted I would have done better. But I really do think it's the book, not me.Anyway, there is lots of interesting stuff.:Apparently lots of computer programmers count ""zero, one, two, three, four... there are five."" (Mentioned in the section that refutes Linguistic Determinism.)""Put the new material last,"" and ""put the heavy material last"" are two of the most important guidelines for good style in writing and speaking. (I assume that by 'good' he means 'effective' and in context he means 'of exposition.') (In any case, I disagree. He used that style in this book, and I found it unhelpful.)To make a potion that changes color on demand, boil small pieces of purple cabbage in water, then fish out the cabbage and let the purple liquid cool. If you add a base to it, such as baking soda, it will turn green; if you add an acid, like lemon juice, it will turn pink.In some languages, like Chinese, *all* nouns behave like mass nouns, standing for the concept itself rather than for separate incarnations of it, and speakers may not count or pluralize them without the use of a classifier, as in 'two tools of hammer' or 'three rods of pen.' (Not sure how credible that is. No source note is given, and which Chinese language is being referenced, anyway?)In the decade between the sexual revolution of the early 1960s and the feminist revolution of the early 1970s, many works of popular culture celebrated the overthrow of puritanism with sympathetic portrayals of lascivious men.... (recognized now as) misogynistic today, with depictions of women as bimbos and an amused tolerance of rape, harassment, and spousal abuse. (Ah, so that explains why some novels, esp. SF, are popular among men, esp. those slightly older than I, and are seen as horrible by me!).Well, anyway, if you do decide to try to read this, remember the lens through which the author tries to focus. As he says in the last chapter (actually an epilogue though not so titled):""In this book I have [explored]... what we can learn about human nature from the meanings of words and constructions and how they are used."""
20,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In The Stuff of Thought Steven Pinker, noted public intellectual and linguist at MIT, ""analyzes how our words relate to thoughts and to the world around us and reveals what this tells us about ourselves"". So, sure … language can provide a “window into human nature”, just as the output of a computer can tell us something about the software it is running.  The question is, whether this ‘window’ is interesting. Let’s look at an example. You can “load hay onto the wagon” and you can “load the wagon with hay”, they mean the same thing. Along the same lines, you can “toss the cat onto the bed”, but you can’t “toss the bed with the cat”, the latter is nonsensical. Why? Because in the first example – we are describing an activity that changes the state of the wagon … from empty to full. In the second example – when we toss something on a bed, we don’t think of the bed’s state as being changed. We can therefore conclude that the brain must think that an object’s state is important since it features prominently in the construction of these types of sentences. The verb “load” implies a change of state in the object, the verb “toss” does not. Does that reveal something profound about the brain? I suppose linguists think so, but frankly … meh. The book largely consists of an endless series of examples along the lines of the above dealing with such things as: verbs, time, place, relations of objects with respect to each other, direction, quantity, word and name origins and trends, profanity and others.  I very much enjoyed The Better Angels of our Natures and The Blank Slate, but the books Pinker has written about his own field of expertise (linguistics), not so much. They come across as too wonky (a word that is a phonaesthesia in case you were wondering) and arcane to leave much of an impression. I should say that it didn’t help that I listened to the audio version of this book, a format that isn’t particularly suited to the comprehension of abstruse concepts."
21,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1802502-kevan,4,"I've read a number of Pinker's books.I very much enjoyed The Language Instinct and quite enjoyed How the Mind Works.I read Words and Rules when living in Thailand and learning Thai. I had real problems mapping what he had to say from English to Thai. What he had to say about English and its implication for how the Mind/Language engine work simply did not seem to be true.The Stuff of Thought seems much more solid though and I am finding it quite fascinating.Pinker keeps saying ""for English speakers"" and ""in English"" which I definitely don't recall him doing in Words and Rules.It will be interesting to see if he explores how the deeper cognitive structures he posits map across languages.I'd be interested to know if other readers had also worried about this problem and what they had learned since.---------------He does indeed go on to touch upon multiple languages.I found the chapter on verbs ""Down the rabbit hole"" interesting for many reasons. It was fascinating not just because it showed that there are families of verbs whose existence I had never suspected existed but also because I was impressed by how this type of analysis provides a plausible window on the mind.Unfortunately, this was, for me, the highpoint of book. I most enjoy Pinker when he's doing the detailed, example baaed stuff around language. I find him much less convincing when he moves onto the broader canvas of the mind and morality.Still, worth the read."
22,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,5,"I am disappointed that I didn't find and read this book while I was in grad school, there are some quotes that would have worked quite well for the paper I wrote on comparative naming cultures.There, now that I have completely sounded like an arrogant elitist intellectual, I can talk about my other impressions about this book.Wow.That's really the only thing I can say. Pinker thinks about verbs more deeply than I've ever thought about anything. I like abstract thought, don't get me wrong, I like linguistics, I enjoy musing about a linguistic puzzle for a couple of hours, that's just good fun. But to spend like 100 pages just talking about verbs?!? His seemingly favorite topic in this chapter was content locatives. I've never thought about content locatives. Not once. The difference between loading a wagon with hay, and loading hay into a wagon. Seriously, who spends enough hours thinking about such a thing to build a cogent theory that takes 100 pages to explain!?!? I am in awe. Like I said, I enjoy a good abstract thought puzzle every now and again, and had the arrogance to think that I was something special until I read this book. Then I realized, nope, I'm just your run of the mill dabbler, people like Pinker take abstract and deep thought to a whole new level that I don't even want to attempt. That said, I really enjoyed the book and I learned a lot from it. Not only is he a deep thinker, but he is a good writer and when you can't understand him, it's not because he writes in an obtuse way, it's just that you are literally incapable of going that deep into a concept."
23,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1152135-john,4,"This is a fast read book. Though I don't like Pinker's allegiance to Chomsky, I think he's great for summing up the bunches of different theories and even better at describing the problems in linguistics that people are trying to understand--excellent examples! And he has an entertaining narrative voice. My only beef was that after he spent time talking about fallacious arguments and the people who use them, he tended to attack ""radical"" or ""extreme"" versions of theories, thereby leading the reader to think (not always) that the whole of those particular fields were stupid. And then later, appeals to different parts of said theories to back up what he, himself, is arguing. BUT, having said that, it was a fun read and,again, a great (re-)introduction to conceptual metaphor theory and its competition to explain everyday things, like why is it we tend to use a swear word after hitting our thumbs with a hammer? And though I don't necessarily buy into every explanation, they are still worthwhile to consider because they, again, highlight sets of problems that linguists face when trying to understand why we do the things we do with language."
24,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1507845-kc,3,"I've seen Steven Pinker cited in all kinds of places, and understood he’s somewhat of an authority on psychology, cognition, and other brain-related areas. So when I started ""The Stuff of Thought,"" I anticipated getting real philosophical real quick. Instead, the entire book is not so much about thought, but about language, and what it reveals about the thoughts that produce it. So here, Pinker is much more of a lexicographer than a psychologist, although the entire subtext is about trying to understand how we form and process thoughts, with language simply being a concrete, measurable proxy.The tricky part is that language is so tied to culture and sociology, that confounding variables are bound to arise. This doesn't invalidate the premise, far from it: our thoughts are indeed impacted by our socialities, and the various taboos and socially-tempered approaches to language certainly do reveal something of the innate construction of abstract human psyche.I don't know if there were any big ah-ha's or major takeaways since much of it was stating the obvious with hard examples found in linguistic corpora. An entertaining and interesting discussion nonetheless."

I did just complete a module in speech and language development last week, and I finished reading this book yesterday, so this heightened sensitivity to words might not last forever. We shall see. Highly recommend this to everyone who has the patience to sit with this for a little longer than usual, regardless of interest. It's quite rewarding and verbs will be your friends forevermore"

27,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934928-dan,2,"I am always hesitant to completely pan a book that is clearly written by someone vastly more intelligent than I, but in this case I would have to say that this book definitely did not work for me.The root of my problem with this book is that the claims and synopsis printed on the cover seem to bear little relation to the actual material contained within. We are led to believe that this is a book solidly within the ""popular science"" category and that it will deal primarily with the concept of how language molds the way that we think and interact.Instead, we crack open the novel to find what would best be suited as a textbook for the aspiring linguist. The first third of this book is devoted almost entirely to what seems like some sort of painful flashback to 6th grade English grammar lessons - on speed. Its been a long while since the days of transitive/intransitive/ambitransitive verbs, content-lockatives, and the like. I'll admit that I do not share Pinker's sense of thrill when discussing such topics, but I did slog through them and can vaguely see why he begins his discussion with this approach. Yet the ""meat"" of this initial discussion seems fairly scanty relative to the painfulness of the necessary effort on the part of the reader.The book picks up a little steam as it heads into the next few chapters. Describing those on the ""fringe"" of the language & thought debate. First we hear of academics that make claims that imply that nearly all words are innate to the human mind, and are inborn as part of our genetic makeup (i.e. that our vocabulary is essentially hard-wired). Pinker dispatches this idea summarily - a feat that hardly seemed heroic, given how ludicrous the concept is. Then Pinker goes on to disarm the arguments of the opposing camp, Determinists that believe that language controls thought. As an uninitiated, arm-chair philosophizer on the subject of language and thought, I had always given more credit to this idea. I am aware of how much of my inner life and thoughts seem to use a dialog that is carried out in words. However, Pinker gives scientific evidence that suggests that our minds control language moreso than the other way around. This was my favorite part of the book. Yet, by deflating this argument, Pinker also takes away a good deal of the relevance of the book, thereby deflating my interest as well...The major themes in the rest of the book take the form of:1. Dissecting the ideas of other academics in the field. Which again, would be a great deal more interesting if I had actually decided to go into graduate school for linguistics and was familiar with these persons.2. Discussing tangental psychological/cultural concepts, often in terms that seem so divorced from language that one might wonder if they are sections taken from another book. 3. Hand-wavy ideas about the evolution of the human brain.And last, but certainly not least...4. LOOOOOONNNNGGGG paragraphs of word-""play"" in-between.Its not so much that Pinker doesn't have interesting ideas wedged in here and there, its just that if you've followed other sciences, you've most likely encountered most of these concepts before. Then again, even some of the original ideas that I found in this book were fairly obvious and were ones that I had already conceptualized myself, even if I wouldn't have been able to frame them as well as Pinker does. Furthermore, Pinker writes with a playfulness towards language that is fun in short bursts, but can obscure his point and be exhausting in the long haul. The delivery of some ideas were so couched in unnecessary detail that I almost felt like Steven Pinker and ""The English Language"" were sharing some sort of private joke. Frequently, after spending a few moments to decrypt some of his more florid paragraphs, I found that the concept they contained was fairly banal.Pluses: Pinker clearly knows his stuff and presents it with what appears to be an unbiased eye. The sections involving direct scientific experiments were revealing and fun, as were the sections on polite language and sex (as sex always is...). The language of the book is a great exercise in concentration and is peppered with lots of great SAT/GRE-Prep words! Doubles in value as a good Kaplan study book! The take-home message seemed to be that language is not in control, we (and culture) are... Which is a reassuring thought, and is one that I am grateful to have learned.Negatives: By thereby castrating the power of language to affect our thought process with his initial arguments, much of the remainder of the book is left floundering around in the domains of other disciplines. We hear of psychology, cultural practices, and evolution. Yet, language must now take a passive back-seat to these issues, only acting to give us tiny clues to their nature. The novel concepts that language can teach us turn out to seem scanty and flimsy. Furthermore, manner in which Pinker doles out these intriguing little nibblets seems unnecessarily drawn-out and buried in overly technical/flowery language. In the end, too much of this book seems to reach for something larger, but end up as merely 'semantics' (fully in the negative connotation of the word)."
28,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"2016: I still find his main idea in this book quite interesting and convincing, namely that the way we think is not controlled by language, but rather that language is an expression of, or a window in to, how our thinking work. It would be a little strange if it wasn't the case that our mind is constructed in a particular way in our thinking. It is perhaps more amazing that the mind works in a way that it is able to analyze itself in this intricate way. I know that Pinker argues that it is easy to make a computer aware of itself, but the level of self-reflexivity in the human mind is still impressive I think.Anyway, Pinker shows that we really are much affected by language in how we think. He does point out the power of framing - even though he later points out that the different frames are not exactly the same things. I suppose he wants to say that it would be possible to objectively verify whether the invasion of Iraq was an invasion or a liberation and in that way know what type of frame to use. But that is of course, the problem of the ""soft"" sciences, I don't think any such certainty will be possible.I do wonder if he steers away a little from the strict individualism and computational theory of mind in this book when he writes about the importance of the agonist. Is the agonist real? Is it a social construction? Is it a construction of our mind? Is it a construction of our language? What makes us think in terms of agency? This is a very interesting question and I think Pinker's writing here is quite interesting as well. There is a little more openness to the importance of the social and relational in this book and I think that is the way to explain agency (this move is even more clear in Better Angels of Our Nature i think) for a main problem with his earlier work, in my mind, is that the combination of individualism (or collectivism) and a reductive theory of the mind undermines agency.2012: Now I feel compelled to write something very clever and thoughtful, but maybe that has to wait for my PhD. There are many, many interesting arguments in this book and Pinker is very successful in showing the validity of his main argument, that language is a window into human thinking and he argues well that language is not controlling human thinking in the way that Wittgenstein and the philosophical schools following him argued. However, I still don't quite understand ""what"" thinking is if it is, in a way, disconnected from language in its essence so to speak.The style is extremely witty and there is no doubt that he is very well read. There is also an ease in the reference to scholarly literature which is a release for the reader. I suppose that PInker argues throughout from a evolutionary psychological view point, but this becomes most clear in the second to last chapter and maybe it is simply because I am still very critical towards that school of thought, but to my mind the second to last chapter is the least convincing. Somehow I don't feel like evolutionary psychology quite manages to account for the complexity of human interaction. Maybe it has something to do with explanatory levels. Pinker is excellent when he is explaining the ""Stuff of thought"" (to coin a phrase) in terms of how language works and how that can be related to human thinking. However, when that explanation is being brought up on a more macro-level. It tends not to be as convincing."
29,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026842-kathleen-brugger,4,"When I finished this book I was disappointed. I had heard so much about Steven Pinker (this is the first book of his I’ve read). I felt like I had learned very little about human nature. But as I reflected on it over the next few days, my opinion radically changed. I kept bumping into things that were illuminated by the insights in this book. For example, I read an article about how robots are being programmed to follow some of the basic modes of human thought so they interface with humans better, and these basic modes are exactly what Pinker outlined.There are deep structures in our brains, evolved over countless millennia, which allow us to make sense of our sensory experience. These are very similar to the “categories of understanding” described by Immanuel Kant 225 years ago. Pinker lists space, time, substance, object, causation, force, possession, and goal as the basic concepts that form the scaffolding that constructs our mental model of the world. These models are very useful for helping us to navigate the physical world, but science has discovered that our evolved models don’t accurately match reality. Pinker writes, “They add up to a distinctively human model of reality, which differs in major ways from the objective understanding of reality eked out by our best science and logic.” In other words, the basic concepts box us in; they restrict how we can think about reality. This is why quantum physics is so hard to comprehend, and also why it is so difficult to put spiritual experiences into words. What I didn’t like about the book was the excess of examples for every point Pinker made. Sometimes I thought he must really be a linguist, he seems so in love with words. It felt like the desire to give every example possible got in the way of making his point. I would often feel exhausted by the end of a section. This is why I initially had a bad impression of the book: the linguistics got in the way of the psychology."
30,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306429-annelie,5," Pinker’s “The Stuff of Thought” perfectly combines science and literature to create an eye opening novel relating words to the world. Unlike his previous works, he abandons many unnecessary themes and delves deep into the beautiful science in which the mind is encapsulated, showing us what makes us cry, curse, smile, and laugh. He shows us the beauty of our beings, especially young children who learn so many things in such a short period of time. As he exposes the mind through semantics, he explains metaphors, the need for taboos, indirect language, and expletives. While it would not recommend it to an impatient reader, I think this book is not be read like a fiction novel but with the patient, slow eyes of a digester. This book is simply so dense that it is impossible to get much reading done in a day and completely understand what you just have read (which is why I read so slowly in advisory). However, I think this book is really knowledgeable, and has taught me a lot, from the ideas that Pinker is trying to convey to historic events and vocabulary. I highly recommend this book!"
31,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3078781-celebrilomiel,4,"A fascinating look at language, grammar, and the way our brains process concepts.A word to the wary: the seventh chapter holds more obscenities within its fifty pages than Hemingway's entire corpus contains. One might find the words shocking even by Tumblr standards. The profanity isn't gratuitous, of course: the chapter's focus is expletives and dysphemisms, the psychology behind them, how our brains process them, why they are used, and why their grammar differs from that of usual language (especially in regards to transitive and intransitive verbs) — all of which was illuminating and helped me grasp, to a degree, why some words are so appalling and why people curse so much. Although I did tend to cover the already-read portion of the page with my bookmark so I wouldn't have to keep catching sight of and subconsciously processing the examples, I still found the chapter worth reading. That said, if you have an eidetic memory or an aversion to foul language, you may want to skip it."
32,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,4,"Excellent book overall. Got me interested in linguistics and the intricacies of tense and aspect of verbs, also learned why the past/future perfects are so perfect (perfect comes from the Latin for completed).Also explained some of Kant's basic ideas from the Critique of Pure Reason without a single mention of transcendental idealism.Intellectually, the book is a good complement to Pinker's earlier 'How the Mind Works', continuing in the framework of the computational theory of mind and the language of thought (a sort of primitive internal language implemented in the brain, sort of the mental equivalent of Assembler language in computer science). Pinker shows how languages are constructed from combination of a few basic concepts and mental models of e.g space, time, causality etc...doing a good job of critiquing alternative theories such as the idea that natural languages fundamentally limit different cultures' thoughts.Also provides a decent summary of Lakoff's theory of metaphors and abstract thinking and some of the social nuances of the use of language."
33,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1150869-joseph,5,"Pinker is a true joy to read, and this book may be his best yet. He examines aspects of human language--including politeness, profanity, metaphor, and the details of word meanings--and shows how they reveal deep structure and knowledge about how our minds conceptualize the world and deal with problem solving and social interactions. As always, Pinker's writing is both smart and witty--the book is packed with scientific findings and often quite technical (though never hard to follow), and I learned a ton (despite having an advanced degree in this field). At the same time, his use of jokes and pop culture references to illustrate his points had me laughing out loud on numerous occasions. All in all, even at 400+ pages, I was left wanting more. Highly recommended for anyone interested in better understanding how we humans work--or for those just in search of a great read that also makes you smarter!"
34,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439410-darcia-helle,5,"This is a difficult book to stick a rating on. Its content will no doubt appeal to a niche audience. The first half is a bit like reading the text for a college lecture. Pinker explores verbs and the way we use them, from tenses to the reasons for our various word choices in conversation. I found the information interesting but, at times, weighty and definitely not 'pleasure reading'. The second half of this book is a much quicker, easier read. Pinker builds off the information in the first half, exploring our use of metaphors in speech and in thought, how names arise, why we find some words more offensive than others, and why people rarely say what they really mean. If you're looking for a kind of pop culture, light read on language and thought, this probably isn't the one. If you love language and you're also interested in how the mind works, Steven Pinker will take you on a fascinating exploration."
35,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,4,"As I closed the book the walls of my mind resounded with a triumphant echo. A feeling of accomplishment overwhelmed me entirely. It was accompanied by a feeling of drained fatigue and relief at having taken on this modern linguistic tome. Steven Pinker has managed to extract from our language some of the framework of how we think. Especially enlightening were the chapters on our innate understanding of physics which do not allow certain grammatical structures to occur. Down the Rabbit Hole, Cleaving the Air, the Metaphor Metaphor, The Seven Words You Can't Say On Television, and Games People Play were my favorite chapters. Some chapters tended to drag on, and/or were not communicated clearly enough. The reason for the 4 stars had to do with some of the chapters lacking clarity as well as the injection of Pinker's personal politics. Other than that, I recommend it for anyone who is interested in linguistics and human nature and how they correlate."
36,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3997545-jennifer,5,"If you like cognitive psychology and linguistics, you will really enjoy this book. I particularly enjoyed Pinker's discussion of metaphors and analogies and how our thoughts and our science are both limited and expanded by the metaphors we have in our language. When I finished this book, I felt a rush as though I stepped outside of my thought processes and limited ways of knowing the world momentarily and could see much broader implications for diplomacy, cross-cultural understanding, science, and creative thinking. While it fed my inner nerd and the conclusion of the book was as exciting as non-fiction can get, I do think I will now move onto something lighter. "
37,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1115629-aaron,4,"Fascinating, funny and dazzlingly cunning contemporary science. Reveals how we mysteriously know how to organise verbs, the overwhelming prevalence of metaphor in our thinking, why neologisms fail, why names vary over time, why swearing is necessary, and crucially where our evolved view of the world falls short, leaving us vulnerable.There's a lot here, and a couple of the end chapters feel more speculative than the confident earlier ones, but this is a mine of insight for anyone interested in thought and language."
38,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,3,"I think that Steven Pinker is one of the best writers, best scientists, and best science writers currently living in America. I would recommend his books THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT, HOW THE MIND WORKS, and THE BLANK SLATE to anyone. But THE STUFF OF THOUGHT has the feel of a book made up of pieces left on the cutting room floor. It doesn't really advance a coherent thesis or break new ground for the author. Rather, it contains a series of essays--some quite fascinating--that didn't really fit in any of the other books."
39,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,3,"Fascinating book about how language and thinking are interlated. This covers both ways: language affecting thought and thinking affecting language. Pinker's ""psycho-linguistics"" has intricate grammatical underpinnings and my eyes always start to glaze over at the finer points of the ""past participle"", so there is a lot of that to slog through and I think the introductory example of the cardinality of 9/11 events rings rather hollow, but over all this is an enlightening book about how we talking animals think and well worth reading."
40,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963654-tamizhmarai,5,"Steven Pinker has the gift of explaining even the most complex philosophical and linguistic puzzles in a manner most easy to understand . His writing style is lucid and elegant, rich with metaphors that make you read his sentences again and again out of sheer pleasure. Given the heavy nature of the subject, one might have allowed for a certain amount of tedium but such is the eloquence and wit of the author that he keeps even the lay reader thoroughly engaged. The initial chapter on verbs and the last chapter on swearing were absolutely fascinating."

HOWEVER, and it's a big however, there's no actual thesis or argument in the whole book. Pinker basically says ""Oh, look! Here are a whole bunch of really cool things about language! You're welcome."" And you know what? That's pretty awesome. But the book only gets 3 stars in my book (har har) because I want my non-fiction to be an argument supported by evidence, not evidence running willy-nilly through the streets like a little child looking for a tree to climb.

42,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368864-mary,5,"I really enjoyed this book. I kept annoying my family and friends with new factoids. I learned useful things about how language illustrates limits in our thought processes, but also how it can overcome those limits. I hope I can put this to use in avoiding bad arguments, arguing against poorly thought out pseudo-science, and explaining difficult concepts to non-scientists. But even if I can't, it was still fascinating. "

My only reservation is I'm not sure how sound the science is. I'd love to see counterarguments. But all in all a worthwhile read.(Should note that the book isn't for those with sensitive ears. He devotes a good portion of the book to obscenities, which of course, requires repeating the obscenity, and talking about it. Definitely one of the more interesting parts of the book, though.)"

I don't even know why (probably because they're all the same: blah blah blah, 9/11, ""my life and everything I knew changed dramatically,"" etc.). Maybe it's too soon?

52,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18681755-constantino-casasbuenas,4,"The Stuff of ThoughtSteven PinkerPenguin Books, 2008I bought this book several years ago. In reality I don’t remember when was that. I do remember I bought it because of my follow up to Heiddeger’s “Qué Significa Pensar” (“What is called Thinking“), which I have read several times. I forgot that I had Pinker’s book in my library, until recently, when we gave as a present to my brother Javier: “The better angels of our nature”, written by Pinkert as well. Both, my brother and Constanza loved it, and I was surprised when defining my Reading plans for 2019, I realised I had “The Stuff of Thought”. I read it and here you have my notes, before reading the one about our angels.The book was written for people interested in language and mind. The use of language defines how we perceive the world. Semantics define the relation from words to: •	Thoughts: Different parts of our life have different semantic features. Political life defines who is controlling its semantics. “language is saturated with implicit metaphors like “EVENTS ARE OBJECT and TIME IS SPACE. 6•	Reality: “Speaker’s commitment about the truth”.9•	Community: “every word in a language must have minted at some point by a single speaker. The rest of the community gradually agrees to use it”. 15 •	Emotions: “No curious person can fail to be puzzled by the illogic and hypocrisy of linguistic taboos”. 20 •	Social relations: see use of internet and what happens with language and its use by specific communities. Down the Rabbit HoleThe second and other chapters are VERY difficult. Not that much because of the content, but because the many relations existing about words and semantics, used in the English language, which are different to other languages. ”This is the rabbit hole that I invite you to explore / one that leads to the world of human ideas and the dramas they engage in”33 . “Designating a sentence as “ungrammatical” simply means that native speakers tend to avoid the sentence, cringe when they hear it, and judge it as sounding odd”.33 A child building his/her language is a process linking deep structures in mind with words and sentences. “The ubiquity of metaphor in every language” is an important point (see Heidegger and how he links thinking with the poetry process and the use of metaphors). It is important to see which is the right framework of events which happen for a word to exist. The gestalt is an important element to see the many factors coming together simultaneously: space, time, causing, possession, goals for language of thought. Many other elements come as well: theory of free will, think about the listener, changes taking place in language, grammar. Fifty Thousand Innate Concepts (and other radical theories of language and thought)Fodor and his concept that we are born with fifty thousand innate concepts. “Then there are the other half million or so lexical items that the Oxford English Dictionary lists”.94 Radical pragmatics is contrary as possible to Extreme Nativism: “Language is a lever with which we can convey surprising facts, weird new ideas, unwelcome news, and other thoughts that a listener may be unprepared for”. 123 This work is about “language and thought”. So, we have conceptual semantics (formulas in an abstract language of thought), and also language determinism (thought). “Once again we find that it is the culture and environment, not the language, that leads to differences in how readily one or another mental ability is put to use”. 148 Perhaps the deepest reason that the effect of language on thought must be limited is that language itself is so badly suited as a medium of reasoning”. 150				Words are fools				Who follow blindly, once they get a lead.				But thoughts are kingfishers that haunt the pools				Of quiet; seldom-seen…								Sigfried Sassoon Cleaving the air“Space, time, causality. We can’ t think without them, yet we can’t make sense of them.”157 “But since we grasp the world only through the structures of our minds, we can’t, wrote Kant, truly know the world in itself.”158 “Similarly, we can focus our spotlight of attention on a region in space, even an empty one, as when a basketball player, staring into his opponent’s eyes cocks an internal spotlight to an empty place on the floor where he expects a teammate to apear.”161 Our eccentric conceptions of substance, space, time and causality “define the daily course of our lives – our commerce, our politics, our legal disputes, even our humour”. 163“How do we determine what is true or false in a make-believe world”.211 “Kant was surely right that our minds <> with concepts of substance, space, time, and causality. They are the substrate of our conscious experience. They are the semantic contents of the major elements of syntax: noun, preposition, tense, verb”. 233The Metaphor MetaphorIt was very surprising to find that in this chapter, Pinker considers the importance of the relation between metaphor and words that we use to express our ideas. I went to the list of references and… I could not find any reference to Heidegger, which was one of the reasons I wanted to read Pinker. I will go into this point at the end of my reference. “A linguistically informed literary criticism is the key to resolving conflict and frustrations, from psychotherapy and law to philosophy and politics. Call this the messianic theory. It is based on the idea that TO THINK IS TO GRASP A METAPHOR – the metaphor metaphor.”238 “When reasoning about a relationship, it’s fine to mull over the metaphorical counterpart to a common destination, the rate at which one reaches it, and the bumps along the way”. 250 “Conceptual metaphors can be learned and used only if they are analyzed into more abstract elements like “cause”, “goal” and “change”.”259 “Still I think that metaphore really is a key to explaining thought and language”.276 WHAT’S IN A NAME?“…one aspect from the humble act of naming has recently been found to overturn our understanding of logic, meaning, and the relation of knowledge to reality”. 281 Talking about stars, water, persons who do not yet exist, etc…”these entities spray no energy in our way, and our bodies have no sense organs for them, yet somehow a diaphanous strand of semantics connects them to us. As the philosopher Colin McGinn put it, meaning seems to <THE SEVEN WORDS YOU CAN’T SAY ON TELEVISION“These expressions raise many puzzles for anyone interested in language as a window into human nature”. 325 “To the libertines, what’s self-evident is that linguistic taboos are absurd. A true moralist, they say, should hold that it’s violence and inequality, that are “obscene”, not sex and excretion.”326 The mammalian brain contains, among other things, the limbic system, an ancient network that regulates motivation and emotion, and the neocortex, the crinkled surface of the brain, which ballooned in human evolution and which is the seat of perception, knowledge, reason and planning.”331”Allan and Burridge estimate that English has accumulated more tan eight hundred expressions for copulation, a thousand for a penis, twelve hundred for a vagina.”350 “I suspect that our sense of offense comes from the nature of speech recognition and from what it means to understand the connotation of a Word”. 369GAMES PEOPLE PLAYFor me, this is perhaps the best chapter of the whole book. “Our words are as much a part of our social selves as our appearance and demeanour, and so a mistaken-identity plot can lay bare some of the ways we cloak our intentions in language”. 373 See how truth or lies (or “neutral” language) ar included in sharing, ranking, trading. Though we live globalisation, the cultural context for our words is fundamental: the paradox of rational ignorance. ESCAPING THE CAVE“When you combine these two aptitudes – metaphore and compositionality – the language of thought can be pressed into service to conceive and express a ceaseless geyser of ideas”. 437“None of these, of course, come easily to us. It underscores the place of education in a scientifically literate democracy, and even suggest a statement of purpose for it (a surprisingly elusive principle in higher education today”. 439“The view from language shows us the cave we inhabit, and also the best way out of it”. 439Though it was very difficult t to read it, it’s a very good text. I found only two difficulties which I mentioned before:1) Do we have something similar in Spanish? Though Pinker’s book has many global elements, it is very closely attached to the English language. Do we have this kind of analysis for Spanish, and for a context like the one we live in Colombia? This is an important aspect to research about. 2) While ignoring Heidegger (Philosophy), Pinker (Science) uses some of the key categories used by the first: I am talking about the use of metaphors and poetry. Is it necessary to validate this dissonance? I think that it is not. As an example of the dissonance, I want to end this review with the poem (about words!) written by Sigfried Sassoon:If you could crowd them into forty lines! Yes; you can do it, once you get a start; All that you want is waiting in your head, For long-ago you’ve learnt it off by heart. . . . . Begin: your mind’s the room where you have slept,(Don’t pause for rhymes), till twilight woke you early. The window stands wide-open, as it stood When tree-tops loomed enchanted for a child Hearing the dawn’s first thrushes through the wood Warbling (you know the words) serene and wild.You’ve said it all before: you dreamed of Death, A dim Apollo in the bird-voiced breeze That drifts across the morning veiled with showers, While golden weather shines among dark trees. You’ve got your limitations; let them sing, And all your life will waken with a cry: Why should you halt when rapture’s on the wing And you’ve no limit but the cloud-flocked sky?... But some chap shouts, ‘Here, stop it; that’s been done!’— As God might holloa to the rising sun, And then relent, because the glorying rays Remind Him of green-glinting Eden days, And Adam’s trustful eyes as he looks up From carving eagles on his beechwood cup. Young Adam knew his job; he could condense Life to an eagle from the unknown immense.... Go on, whoever you are; your lines can be A whisper in the music from the weirs Of song that plunge and tumble toward the sea That is the uncharted mercy of our tears. . . . . I told you it was easy! ... Words are fools Who follow blindly, once they get a lead. But thoughts are kingfishers that haunt the pools Of quiet; seldom-seen: and all you need Is just that flash of joy above your dream. So, when those forty platitudes are done, You’ll hear a bird-note calling from the stream That wandered through your childhood; and the sun Will strike the old flaming wonder from the waters.... And there’ll be forty lines not yet begun. "
53,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431670-sarah-gibson,4,"I didn't think it was as interesting as The Language Instinct or The Blank Slate, but it still had some interesting bits.It's basically about how looking at language--how we talk about certain things, the words we choose, how we construct phrases--can give us insight into human nature, how we think.One example is: we can say ""load hay into the wagon"" or ""load the wagon with hay"". We can say ""pour water into the glass"" but NOT ""pour the glass with water"". We can say ""fill the glass with water"" but NOT ""fill water into the glass"". This is because certain verbs indicate changing the state of something (like ""fill""), while others indicate a manner of motion (like ""pour""), while still others indicate both at the same time (like ""load""). Similarly, certain verbs imply causing vs. letting, causing to go vs. causing to have, just happened vs. caused to happen...it gets complicated. The lesson is that looking at different grammatical constructions sheds light on how speakers categorize verbs, which uncovers our innate concepts of substance, space, time, and force.The chapter ""Cleaving the Air"" also taught me some interesting concepts, many from philosophy. The chapter is about substance, space, time, and causality. Regarding substance, he gives examples of how different types of nouns reflect how we perceive substances (e.g. count nouns like ""apple"" and ""pebble"" for bounded hunks of matter and mass nouns like ""applesauce"" and ""gravel"" for substances without boundaries). Regarding time, he compares bounded accomplishments (""draw a circle"") with unbounded activities (""jog"") and durative verbs (""slide"") with iterative verbs (""pound""). The section on causality was the most interesting to me. It reviews the theories of ""what is causality"": the constant-conjunction theory (which is basically just correlation), the counterfactual theory (""A caused B"" means ""B would not have happened if not for A""), and very interesting logical inconsistencies with both theories. The conclusion is that neither of these theories succeed in describing our innate sense of causality, which is more of a ""force-dynamic"" model, an ""intuitive physics"" similar to the medieval notion of impetus, that is revealed by looking at our language (especially verbs).Another chapter of interest was about how we think in ""conceptual"" or ""generative"" metaphors. Some examples: BIG IS IMPORTANT; MORALITY IS CLEANLINESS; GOALS ARE DESTINATIONS; KNOWING IS SEEING; TIME IS A MOVING OBJECT. We are largely unaware that we think in these metaphors, but they pervade our everyday language. For example, ""your claims are indefensible, he attacked every weak point in my argument, his criticisms were right on target, I won the argument"" are all expressions revealing the innate metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR. Similarly, ""our relationship has hit a dead-end street. it's stalled. look how far we've come. it's been a long and bumpy road. we can't turn back now. we're at a crossroads. we may have to go our separate ways. this relationship isn't going anywhere. our marriage is on the rocks"" are all expressions for the metaphor LOVE IS A JOURNEY. Interestingly, different people can use different metaphors to frame the same topic/event, which can lead to disagreements. For example, ""invading Iraq vs. liberating Iraq"", ""ending a pregnancy vs. killing an unborn child"", ""redistributing wealth"" vs. ""confiscating earnings."" Interesting quote from this chapter: ""If all abstract thought is metaphorical, and all metaphors are assembled out of biologically basic concepts, then we would have an explanation for the evolution of human intelligence. Human intelligence would be a product of metaphor and combinatorics. Metaphor allows the mind to use a few basic ideas--substance, location, force, goal--to understand more abstract domains. Combinatorics allows a finite set of simple ideas to give rise to an infinite set of complex ones.""He also dedicates a chapter to swearing. Most swear words are related to things which humans are or once were in awe of (deities & their parts/possessions), afraid of (disease, death), or disgusted by (bodily secretions). There is a certain place in the right hemisphere, a more primitive area, that responds to swear words. And speech perception is automatic. So when someone says a swear word, we are immediately forced to think about said nasty concepts against our will. People inflict these thoughts on others for various reasons, e.g. to intimidate or denigrate them or to get their attention. He gives the example of a deaf sufferer of Tourette's syndrome who actually produced ""f***"" and ""sh**"" in sign language! Also: ""Some cognitive neuroscientists have revived Darwin's suggestion that verbalized outbursts were the evolutionary missing link between primate calls and human languages. If so, swearing would have played a more important role in the human career than most people would acknowledge.""A chapter on indirect speech: ""Language is not just a window into human nature but a fistula: an open wound through which our innards are exposed to an infectious world. It's not surprising that we expect people to sheathe their words in politeness and innuendo and other forms of doublespeak.""Interesting random tidbits:""The word 'will' itself is ambiguous between future tense and an expression of determination....It's as if the language is affirming the ethos that people have the power to make their own futures."" p. 196""Here is a rule of thumb in anthropology: whenever a society (including ours) has a cultural practice that seems bizarre, its members may be manipulating their intuitive biology to enhance feelings of communality."" p. 403""In the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967, the UN Security Council passed its famous Resolution 242, which, among other things, called for 'withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict.' The phrase territories occupied in the recent conflict, a noun phrase lacking an overt quantifier, is ambiguous between 'some of the territories' and 'all of the territories.' The resolution was palatable to Israel and its allies under the former interpretation, and to the concerned Arab states and their allies under the latter.

We can visualize unicorns and centaurs, people who are faster than a speeding bullet, and a brotherhood of man sharing all the world.

The advertisers know that the plural is more likely to be typed by people who are planning to buy a digital camera, though they don't know why. The reason is that a bare noun like 'digital camera' is generic, and is likely to be typed by someone who wants to know how they work. A plural like 'digital cameras' is more likely to be referential, and typed by someone who wants to know about the kinds that are out there and how to get one."" p. 165""The two most vivid forms of working memory are mental images, also called a visuospatial sketchpad, and snatches of inner speech, also called a phonological loop. People often use their phonological loop to keep a phone number in mind, to do mental arithmetic, and to keep track of left and right when following directions or remembering locations. The fact that language has a physical side--sound and pronunciation--makes it useful as a medium of working memory, because it allows information to be temporarily offloaded into the auditory and motor parts of the brain, freeing up capacity in the central systems that traffic in more abstract information."" p. 129The construction ""Sam cut Brian's arm"" construes a person ""as a kind of immaterial soul who possesses his body parts, whereas the construct ""Sam cut Brian on the arm"" construes him ""as an incarnate hunk that *is* his body parts.

I got the flavor, but not the notes so to speak. Despite it being a bit more academic than my poor, boggled brain could completely wrap itself around, I found it very interesting and informative. One of the points Pinker put into words is a feeling I've always had and only lamely voiced as, ""everything is a matter of perception.""Pinker writes, “Semantics is about the relation of words to thoughts, but it also about the relation of words to other human concerns. Semantics is about the relation of words to reality—the way that speakers commit themselves to a shared understanding of the truth, and the way their thoughts are anchored to things and situations in the world.”Pinker also goes on to explain how humans have transcended (evolved?) by use of metaphor, how certain words (just a collection of letters and vocal utterances) have been deemed taboo (my thirteen-year-old's heart delighted at Pinker's modulated, academic voice reciting the Seven Words You Can't Say on Television), how names flow in and out of favor, but especially how slippery, piercing, dangerous, and beautiful language is.There was so much to this book and I know parts of it were lost as I walked the dogs and let my mind wander off after them. I listened to this while on vacation and it is, by no stretch of the imagination, a 'beach read'. I may have to put it aside and listen to it again at a later date. “We are verbivores, a species that lives on words, and the meaning and use of language are bound to be among the major things we ponder, share, and dispute.” “For none of us can ever give the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows, and language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.” (-Flaubert)"
55,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Amazon review:Is there a difference between the meanings of these two sentences? (1) Hal loaded hay into the wagon, and, (2) Hal loaded the wagon with hay. Well, Steven Pinker claims there is a difference and it's a difference that reveals something about the way the mind conceptualizes experience. That is ""the stuff of thought"" with which Pinker's latest book is concerned, and this ""stuff,"" as he convincingly demonstrates, can be made accessible through a careful analysis of ""the stuff of language,"" i.e., word categories and their syntactic habitats. In the case of the two sentences above, we can see the human capacity to frame events in alternate ways through the dual function of verbs like ""load."" This verb draws attention to the hay and its movement in the first sentence, but to the transformation (a kind of metaphorical ""movement"") of the wagon in the second. That children can learn the dual use of ""load"" and the dual conceptualizations that it entails, and distinguish this verb from others (like, say, toss) that don't work in both sentences (E.g., we don't say ""Hal tossed the wagon with hay"" even though we can say ""Hal tossed the hay into the wagon"") is evidence that distinct ways of thinking underlie our ability to master language. There are, after all, many thousands of verbs that fall into scores of different categories based on their applicability to different contexts like those involving Hal's hay in the cases above. Pinker believes that our ability to learn the subtle distinctions that control these and other word usages is evidence of their role as reflectors and enablers of the basic elements of human thought, elements like causality, animation, possession, time-as-space, and so on. Pinker faces quite a challenge in bringing to life profound truths about human nature through a systematic, fine-grained analysis of mundane words like ""drip"" and ""pour,"" but he succeeds admirably. This is a book that will amply reward a careful reading. Of course some words are inherently more interesting than others, and for my money the chapter on ""The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television"" is by itself worth the price of the book. A number of features that help condemn a word to the realm of taboo are revealed here. For example, there are clear syntactic distinctions between the usually unprintable words for sex (which Pinker, I'm happy to report, audaciously prints) and their more presentable cousins, such as have sex, make love, sleep together, copulate, etc. I had never before noticed that the taboo and vulgar forms, which tend to specify physical motion, differ from the non-taboo terms in that they usually occur in a subject-verb-direct object construction (e.g., Austin shagged Vanessa). The more respectable terms lack a direct object and do not specify ""a particular manner of motion or effect."" Furthermore, they are semantically symmetrical, so that if Austin had sex with Vanessa, Vanessa also had sex with Austin. More fundamentally Pinker ties the cathartic effect of some swearing with ""the Rage circuit, which [is]... connected with negative emotion."" The Rage circuit, as part of the limbic system, is found in other animals and is associated with ""a reflex in which a suddenly wounded or confined animal would erupt in a furious struggle to startle, injure and escape from a predator, often accompanied by a bloodcurdling yowl."" This is rich stuff, the drawing of a neat connection between a specific category of words and an emotional pattern linked to specific parts of the brain. This chapter also helps make sense of Tourette's syndrome and otherwise identifies swearing as ""a coherent neurobiological phenomenon."" Other chapters are similarly rewarding. Pinker's analysis of metaphors both expands on, and, to an extent, revises the classic works in this field by George Lakoff, Mark Johnson and others. I have some quibbles with parts of Pinker's overall model, but this is to be expected with a work so ambitious and wide-ranging. I am surprised, for example, that Pinker doesn't mention the extensive work on cognitive prototypes by such authors as Brent Berlin and Eleanor Rosch since their research seems to overlap with his. Another point: His arguments against connectionist models of language and thought I found to be not quite convincing. Here Pinker is arguing for a genetically-based set of neural patterns to explain the complexities of language, where connectionism points to a more flexible, post-natal learning system. Pinker demonstrates that connectionism is probably not adequate to explain language learning if one assumes (as he apparently does) that learning after puberty is just as permanent as that which is learned in childhood. But such an assumption is unwarranted, and if childhood learning does have a special durability, his criticism of connectionism loses its punch. Also, in discussing social change (part of his analysis of changing tastes in the naming of children), he cites data indicating that most disappearances such as the end of hat-wearing among men in the 1960s, were the natural outcome of a long and steadily declining trajectory for this fashion. However, there are so many distinctly abrupt social changes that can be identified in this era (including such linguistic ones as the disappearance of the basic slang term ""swell"" and its replacement by ""cool"") that this argument for gradual social change leaves me skeptical. Naturally these are the kinds of disputable points that a book like this is bound to stir up, and that's, of course, all to the good. All in all, Pinker has succeeded, once again, in writing a book which, while effectively tackling a very knotty set of issues, manages to be both accessible and engaging. "

I almost NEVER put a book down no matter what the case but this book was just too informative for me, i didnt know it had so many pages lol overall, i got through about 1\3 of the book and learned about how we communicate and i loved it. Wish i had the guts to finish the whole thing. Overall, insightful and informative."
57,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"Two-thirds into the book, starting with the metaphor chapter and reaching peak intensity in the chapter about neologisms, I was suddenly totally hooked. Finding a method to the madness of new words, reaching into deep structures like phonesthesia, struck me as genius. Suddenly I was loving the depth and width of examples, the lovely pithy witticisms from all walks of life that rounded out complicated concepts with memorable nuggets. This left me in an awkward position. Either the first two-thirds of the book was boring, but given my creeping suspicion that the theme of the book hadn’t changed even slightly, I was left feeling that I had just wasted the first two-thirds with a sub-literate experience. If this were not true, and the first 2/3rd was objectively less good, then it’s quite a deviously ingenious way of organizing material. There are very few non-fiction books that are 100% mindblowing. Most start with the good stuff and end weakly, and us readers are not fooled. Some, like this one (if true), end amazingly and my instinctive reaction is that I’ve not properly understood or appreciated the initial bits. Well played.Why do popular non-fiction books contain so many names of scientists? In an academic paper, every citation is detailed. In a book read primarily by filthy casuals like me? I will remember exactly two of these. Sapir and Whorf. There’s surely value in mentioning the names of famous scientists whose concepts have entered the textbooks, but to name in full detail all five research assistants who worked on a paper that the author found interesting on a slow Thursday afternoon scanning Reddit for Rick and Morty fan theories? The density of names mentioned in connection with a study or hypothesis never lets up, and there is no level of juniority that does not deserve a mention, like the student he talked into going through thousands of baby-dialogues trying to pick out metaphors. The surface level interpretation is that he’s too polite not to name these people, despite the value of such name-dropping dropping to zero like the people thanked in an Oscar speech. An interesting possibility is whether, as annoyingly social beings, our brains pay more attention and are more emotionally involved/invested when a name is mentioned, as opposed to just rattling off research findings and concepts. Can we take this one step farther, and have a book where every research is introduced not just by the people responsible, but also with a short biography that sets up their motivations and emotional investments?Saving character count for the notesBertrand Russell’s famous example, I’m firm, you are obstinate, he is pig-headed, and other variants like I’m exploring my sexuality, you are promiscuous, she is a slut, not just revealing hypocrisy but the flexibility of the mind to actually perceive similar events as very different, and the language’s flexibility to communicate this.It is so much more interesting (than just writing off as a quirk) to analyze anomalous verbs/words to identify deeper truths. The examples given are of content-locative vs container-locative verbs that in some cases can be alternated and in others not, for instance, he loaded hay into the truck, or he loaded the truck with hay, is alternatable, but he poured water into the glass is not changeable with he poured the glass with water. Beautiful differences emerge when you collect enough of these and categorize them, for instance showing that non-changeable verbs often do not act directly on the object but instead mediate through another force (gravity). It’s also amazing to consider the subtle differences in the mind-image when considering loaded hay into the truck (loaded some hay) or loaded truck with hay (filled entire truck with hay) though they are syntactically the same. But before we think language is cool enough to allow such subtleties of our mind manifest, shouldn’t we wonder just how much more of our subtle thinking our language doesn’t support and therefore we potentially are not even aware of?Throw the ball to him is interchangeable with Throw him the ball (double-object). But push the ball to him is not with push him the ball. Kids automatically learn both the rule as well as the exception, having to do with a one-time force vs continuous force (called ‘aspect’, how spread out in time). First sentence is change of state, second is implying possession by object. Examples show how we consider knowledge to be something we possess, and how communication is like a conduit where the possession transfers from subject to object.The double object sentence: Nay, but me no buts (Sir Walter Scott’s Antiquary). Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds (Romeo&Juliet).Metonyms are derogatory, reduce complexity to insulting simplified versions, like calling women piece of ass or mechanics are wrenches. Hypernyms are flattering, as if elevating to abstract realm of forms, like a camera is a photographic device, or a toothbrush is a dental hygiene instrument.Language (words) might code for more complex objects to be retrieved from short term memory like RAM.Analyzing tenses sheds new light on our conception of time and events. Aspect is the ‘shape’ of an event: whether it is telic (goal-oriented, like swatting a fly) or atelic (jogging), or periodic (hammering a nail), easier to imagine on a number line, as a point, a series of points, or a shaded line ending in a point or just continuing. Another aspect of aspect is whether it is perfective (god-like view of the entire event) or imperfective (zoom-in, see it as it happens, don’t know past or future). Different from ‘perfect’ tense, which is etymologically similar (perfect means ‘complete’, as in perfectly stupid), but carries an implication like ‘i have eaten, so don’t want any more’ as opposed to ‘i ate’.Hume’s view of causation as an illusion, that all just follows other events, and are correlated but causation is meaningless at a deeper level of analysis. A more nuanced view of A caused B is the counter-factual, i.e If it were not for A, B would not occur. There are many issues with this, like A and B shoot C at the same time, by counterfactual they are both innocent.A more nuanced form of counterfactual is the Bayesian method, i.e If A, then X% probability of B, and reverse, if B has occurred, X% probability that A occurred first.We evolved to be partial to the concept of causality and it shows in our language, how we attribute things to an antagonist, how things are causal only if someone intended the result.Even Newtonian physics is counter-intuitive, we don’t think of stationary bodies as actually continuous motion with velocity zero. Similarly, we can’t imagine constant motion, feeling instead that there is an ‘oomph’ that we are endowed with during motion that slowly dissipates and slows down to come to a rest.3 things that elevated humans: Language (abstraction), Tool-making (Engineering outside world to fit our needs), and Cooperation (institutionalized as the legal system).We use metaphors to learn new concepts by building on similar concepts we’ve already learned. But where does the buck stop?The good metaphors are those that identify underlying relationships between things (ad infinitum, relationships between the relationships), rather than just between things. From bad metaphors you can see how the analog stops at the things themselves.Strong dose of radiation destroys tumor+surrounding cells. Weak destroys neither. Now tell them analogy of fortress with radial roads but with mines if army is too big, so solution is to break up army and attack from all sides, no 1 side big enough to trigger the mines. Even with this ‘answer’, only 35% solve the radiation puzzle. Uncharitable explanation is that we’re very stupid. But then people asked to come up with metaphors do very well. So is it that we’re bad at receiving metaphorical connections made in your mind, given your unique neuron connection? Is it harder to understand metaphors than it is to come up with them?How do new words get made? 1. Onomatopoeia; 2. Sound symbolisms: respondents usually match ‘takata’ with a spikey shape and ‘malooma’ with a soft-cloud shape, we instinctively associated certain sounds with real world properties; 3. Phonesthesia: classes of words with similar sounds and meanings, like ‘sn’ words all having to do with nose, snot snooty, snicker, or ‘gl’ words having to do with light, glimmer gleam glint glimpse glance. Children often invent words using this heuristic.Sniglets are words that should exist but don’t. Why don’t they? They often have to do with specific experiences, and the word to describe them is used as a commentary about the experience rather than a definition. Loss of richness if we had a word for it? Is that why we use foreign words like Schadenfreude, which encapsulates idea while still keeping the air of commentary/description rather than just simple language-definition.Panel in charge of selecting new words most likely to become popular have very little predictive success.Leibniz explanation for 2 synchronized clocks: external force like synchronizing wire, or man, or internally so close that they are synchronized. Name trends similarly we think are externally defined but actually we are all part of the trend. 50s Marilyn was popular, people think Monroe, but it was popular hence she changed from Norma Jean Baker to Marilyn. Then it dipped, so people think she made it unpopular and taboo, but it had been dipping since peaking in 30s.Veblen and Quentin Bell’s Class-dynamics of fashion. Rich want to distinguish themselves. Next tier want to emulate rich. Next tier similarly, moves in a wave of absorption, until rich distinguish again. But this is a pendulum, because once skirts get too short they start getting long again.Blowing a raspberry or razzie, is from cockney prosody, where you rhyme using a well known phrase and then drop the rhyming word, leave it to the imagination - so raspberry tart rhymes with fart, and tart gets dropped.5 exceptions in US supreme court to freedom of speech, including things that reduce other people’s liberty, so defensible exceptions like libel, fraud, inciting mob behavior like shouting ‘fire’. But what about obscenity? The lines aren’t even well defined, why do sex and excrement related words qualify as exceptions to freedom of speech.Curse words light up emotional center of brain, amygdala. People with Aphasia can still curse, because these words are stored memory (not rule-based words in linguistic left hemisphere) in right hemisphere. These are stored in basal ganglia, much older neuron clusters. Some have inhibitory, some have excitational. When this gets messed up, we get Tourette’s, Parkinsons, Huntingtons.Linguists define words by good-bad, strong-weak, active-passive; so heroes are good, strong, active; cowards are bad, weak, passive etc. Curse-words are at the perfect storm of bad, strong, and active? Are the greatest orators then those who are able to deliver cutting truths, logically tight discourse, interesting topics, but beautifully worded in a paeanic meter, and imparted with the visceral emotional quality that comes from cursing?That’s why past-version of expletives were ‘cursing’ (invoke negativity on you), or ‘swearing’ (take me seriously, I risk invoking negativity on myself otherwise). ‘Hackneyed imprecations drained of imagery’, why today’s swearing is quite lame and devoid of imagination. Puritanism by Mencken - the fear that someone somewhere might be having fun. Sex is objectively chaotic. Jealousy, insecurity, exploitation, disease, abuse, rape, incest. No wonder it is most popular category of cursing. (Excrement, vermin, disease)Men want more casual sex, related to why they do more casual swearing? 2nd wave of feminism had linguistic equivalent of campaign against porn. Swearing is violent towards women so shouldn’t be allowed. So much press for Eskimo having 100 words for snow. We have 1000 for penis and 2000 for slut.Euphemistic, we make the word politer to get at it obliquely, dysphemistic we make it even ruder. Euphemism for sex are intransitive, needing prepositions (make love to, sleep with). Dysphemistics are transitive, fuck (old norse for beat), shag, bang, screw, hump. People instinctively choose subject as man, gay on top, lesbian with dildo, doing sex to the object. Object part of the activity has become metaphor for things are terrible: got screwed, shafted, fubar.Funny that clean airwaves act saw use of fuck and banned it in all parts of speech, except the adverb, which is exactly what ‘fucking great’ isCursing is frowned upon because you’re forcing disagreeable thoughts on to me. Cursing uses both left and right parts of brain. Combines power of syntax, evocation of metaphor, alliteration meter and rhyme, emotional charge of attitude. all language was speech. all speech is speech act. language is instrumental not a code of symbols. Language has a rationality of its own, it's a different kind of logic, through cooperative principle. - quality, quantity, manner and relevance gives us resulting implied nonliteral speech like irony/sarcasm (lying), backhanded compliment (relevance), coyness (quantity, manner).Why bother? Sarcasm is seen as less negative, more controlled than literal criticism.You know, like, sort of, not as fillers but politeness. UptalkYou actually being the more respectful pronoun. Thou singular, ye respectful plural. Took ye as the single respectful and therefore actually stripped it of respectability? Is the post french revolution philosophy better, where they banned the respectful pronoun for egalite?Arc of formality with names.

58,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,3,"I've owned this book for probably 8 years, and was never able to get very far in it. I finally doubled down by listening to an abridged audiobook and then mapping the bookmarks that I took while listening to the physical pages of the copy I own. This has allowed me to instead read key passages of the book instead of slogging through every page. I had trouble engaging with the portions of this book that focus on the minutiae of grammar, and what it tells us about ourselves. This happens to be the majority of the book. I am not a strong/natural writer, and do not have a very good grasp of the details of grammar and usage. Pinker sometimes makes teaching grammar interesting (for example, the hilarious failure of legislating censorship of the word fuck, a blow-by-blow accounting of Clinton's incredible verbal gymnastics during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and a hilarious literal interpretation of the metaphors in the opening passage of the Declaration of Independence*), but I think a reader who has a good grasp of grammer will get more out of this book. One part I did enjoy was Pinker's debunking of Linguistic Determinism: the belief that one's thinking is limited by one's language. This idea was scientifically formulated in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but also discussed by Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger, among others. I had just read Camus take on something similar earlier this year. An interesting modern take is this idea's application to politics, popularized by George Lakoff in ""Don't think of an Elephant!"" a book I have on my shelf but have not yet read. Now, when I do, I'll approch Lakoff with more skepticism. Here's a nice summary of this rejection:...a true demonstration of Linguistic Determinism would have to show three thigns: that the speakers of a language find it impossibel, or at least extremely difficult, to think in the way that the speakers of another language can; that the difference affects actual reasoning to a conclusionrather than a subjective inclination in hazy circumstances; and that the difference in thought is caused by the difference in language, rather than merely bieng correlated with it for osme other reason sucha s the physical or cultural milieu. Despite its status as the current poster child for neo-Whorfianism in psycholinguistics, the demonstration fails all three tests.The most interesting failure that Pinker cites comes from the Munduruku in Brazil, who have counting words for up to five but can't really perform mathematics on numbers past two. The reason why is because the Munduruku don't have a counting routine, which is a basic algorithm needed to perform mathematics. So despite having the language to describe five-ness, they can't use that concept for much.Some bon mots:- ""Don't name your son William. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is called William."" - Sam Goldwyn- ""I've had a wonderful evening. This wasn't one of them"" - Groucho Marx- ""For none of us can ever give the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows, and language is a cracked kettle on which we beat our our tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity."" - Flaubert, Madame Bovary*""So if language is our guide, the lofty declaration of abstract principles is really a story with a strange and clunky plot. Some people are hanging beneath some other people, connected by cords. As stuff flows by, something forces the lower people to cut the cords and stand beside the upper people, which is what the rules require. They see some onlookers, and clear away the onlookers' view of what forced them to do the cutting."""
59,0670063274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39206373-carol-lynn-rivera,2,"I thought I would love this book. I wanted to love this book. I tried really hard to love this book. I love language, I love science, I love philosophy, I love psychology. I did not love this book.I honestly don't know what to say about it because I honestly didn't understand the point of most of it. Lots of verb lists, the occasional mention of an interesting study about babies doing baby things, stuff about metaphors, names, swearing... in and of themselves, they all contained some interesting tidbits but I truly have no idea how any of it gives us a window into human nature.Forget the subtitle for a minute, and even if you take this book at its surface - a bunch of cool stuff about language - it alternately reads like a science journal, college text book, and ""human interest"" magazine article. I guess I'm in the minority here but something about reading a half a page of verbs every few pages was not very enthralling. I found so much of this so boring that it was difficult to retain anything at all.That's not to say there weren't interesting ideas. Stephen Pinker is witty and can be engaging when he isn't lecturing. But there is a reason that people like Bill Bryson and Neil deGrasse Tyson and Levitt/Dubner and Dan Ariely (to name a few that I enjoy) are so popular - because they're intelligent AND can make the content of their intelligence engaging and accessible. Two things this book was not for me.I was also frustrated many times by references to studies or ideas that were never fully explained. I know the author's job is not to make sure I know everything about everything he is referencing, but he would often begin a story with ""... and in this study, such and such was tested in such and such a way..."" And then conclude with something not dissimilar to ""well, you know the rest."" Um, no, so now that you've set that up and explained everything BUT the punchline, how about telling me the point? In between the ponderousness were flashes of witty brilliance, compelling information about language past and present, fun geekery about how we communicate in often obtuse ways, and a few hanging threads that pointed me in what I hope are more interesting directions to learn more.Unfortunately, most of the experience reading this felt like work and the writing style was too dull to make it worth it."
