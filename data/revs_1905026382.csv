0,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1117991-monique,3,"Well... I had high hopes for this book, but I was left feeling somewhat disappointed. Those of you who know Derren Brown will know what to expect from this book: some information about a few tricks, some stuff about the power of the humand mind and some funny anecdotes, all presented in an interesting if at times somewhat bizarre writing style. That's what you would expect, right? Right. That's what I expected, anyway. And I got all of that, in about half of the book: some stuff about coin and card tricks, some mnemonic devices that seem useful enough, and a nice writing style. So far, so good. However, that's only in the first half of the book. The second half is devoted almost exclusively to Mr. Brown's opinion upon things such as NLP, mediums and alternative medicine. While I really do not begrudge him his opinion and while I do respect his strong sentiments on these matters, I really don't care to read this bloody much about them. While Brown is undoubtedly something of an expert on what the mind can do and about conning, I really don't need to read some 150 pages about how he thinks alternative medicine is useless and psychics are all cons. It's not that I'm offended by his opinion, it's just that I don't find it important enough to read about for *that* long. Some of his points are interesting, but when I as a reader buy a book by such a brilliant performer, I want to read about the kind of stuff he does in his shows. If I want to read someone's lengthy opinion on all sorts of things, I'll go and find a message board on the internet somewhere and post some controversial statements. This book could've been so much more interesting if Brown hadn't been so deeply in love with his own convictions. As it is now, you get one coin trick, one card trick, some info on messing with spectator's minds, a few nice mnemonic devices and then this huuuuuge one-sided rant against all things paranormal. Kind of like my rant about that rant here, but 100 times as long. ;) I read on because I hoped some more interesting stuff was coming, but alas... I should've skipped straight to the 'correspondence' section at the end, which *was* fun. ;) "
1,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"I have recently discovered Derren Brown on Youtube and found his conjuring act amazing. Seeing as his performances in England (he doesn't have much exposure in the states)I discovered him on youtube. He is fascinating so I wanted to pick up his book. He describes the basics of the main elements of his act. He does sections on conjuring tricks, feats of memory, Hypnosis, Reading people, and distinguishing science from pseudo-science (i.e. not being fooled or fooling ourselves). He describes his journey from being a Pentecostal Christian to becoming an atheist. He also fills the book with Pythonesque humor. This book was good but his act is even better. I recommend checking him out on youtube. Like reading tricks and biographical sketches from people like Derren Brown, James Randi or Penn Jillette on can learn the art of illusion and lose some of those troublesome illusions at the same time.Here is a taste of why he is good at what he does. It is too bad he isn't well known in the USA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_CUr..."

3,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2495511-shpow,5,"I was just about ready to buy anything this man would ever produce, and when it was announced that he had a book on the way, I was beside myself with excitement. Its everything I wanted it to be. Derren Brown is the definative man of mystery, who I hold above Houdini himself, owning to the fact Derren does not claim to be anything more than a psychologist who has studied magic for years. To add, he is a complete atheist. Watching his programmes, there is a sense of awe when it comes to his trickery. You believe, more than most magicians, what he does must be magic, and he'll tell you its not. Sometimes he'll reveal how he does it. Most times he doesn't. This book lets you into the mind of the man, and shows you exactly how he does it all. Well, not all, he's admitted to keeping some of the mystery. The book combines resolving the mystery behind just how he does it, tips to help improve your memory (and by God, it helps), how to start up becoming a professional magician, with anecdotes and funny stories along the way. Not only was I pleasently surprised at his skills as a writer, but he's bloody funny as well. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
4,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27110141-jade,1,"I bought this with the intention of learning some helpful memory tricks, and maybe getting an insight into how Derren Brown does some of the things he does... How silly of me.Apparently I missed the part of the blurb where Derren Brown lists his credentials as a historian and scholar of Christianity, and states his intention of disproving God. The first chapter just sees Mr Brown going off on a diatribe about Christianity and seemingly religion in general. I respect the fact that he is an atheist, but just as I don't appreciate religious clerics or followers shoving their beliefs in my face, the same is true for an atheist (which I see as more and more becoming a religion itself). We get it- you love Richard Dawkins. Now can we get to the reason we bought the book? You know, the stuff you're actually famous for?All in all I found the first 30 pages so repetitive and annoying in there continuing misinformed denunciations of religion that I left the book on the train, rather than submit some poor sod to buying it from a charity shop.There could have been some great stuff in the other chapters but he put a bad taste in my mouth so early on that I couldn't bare to venture on. "
5,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1840813-angela-randall,5,"I was really impressed with the memory section, thinking that this is exactly the sort of thing children should be taught early in order to make the best of their education. Conveniently wrapped up with a healthy dose of scepticism, challenges of religious beliefs, reminders to pay attention to how others perceive you, showmanship and magic. I think this is an important book for any person to read as early as they can handle it."
6,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48274431-jos-castro,5,"Took me 8 years to read this book.The two magic tricks in the beginning sparked so much curiosity that I had to put down the book for a while as I delved into the world of magic.I then side-tracked into dozens of magic books, took a year of lessons from one of the world’s greatest magicians (none other than Michael Vincent), travelled to a series of magic conventions, briefly met Derren Brown himself during the early stages of this adventure (and told him about the beginnings of this journey), spent a couple thousand hours practicing, reading and performing, and every now and then I got back to reading a bit more of this book.I finished it yesterday.My book shelves now contain over 100 books that wouldn’t be there if I hadn’t gotten my hands on this one.I am now capable of astonishing pretty much anyone.My wife’s first memory of me is watching me perform for - and astound - a group of 50 people at a dinner at the salsa club (never mind the fact that she had danced with me several times during the previous couple of months).Our first kid, who should be born any day now, will likely be known to his little friends as the son of the magician or, fingers crossed, as the magic kid himself.I never did turn to performing professionally, but I have done my gigs at restaurants, weddings, corporate events and whatnot. Successfully.Instead, I continued my professional career in Computer Science, now armed with a deck of cards and an aura of astonishment that has drawn people towards me and has opened doors everywhere I go.I made tons of friends in magic and many others outside of it thanks to magic, I inducted several people into the world of illusionism and I even relit the spark on many a folk who had long before put down their decks.Long story short: I became a magician, got married, am about to have a kid.Even my father has now done a few kids shows with great success.And I know that if I crossed paths with Derren again (which might easily happen, as we now have a few friends in common) and performed in his presence, I would not embarrass the craft.I think it's fair to say that this book changed my life.And life is good.(BTW, I especially enjoyed - and made use of - the chapter on memory)"
7,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/435391-alex-k-rup,5,"At first I found this book funny, but nonetheless weird and in lack of editing.... But read on now... :)Derren Brown didn't seem to have a specific goal with the book, but instead he pours his head (and heart?) out on a lot of subjects from memory and card tricks, self help psychology and rampages about religion, fake psychics and practitioners of alternative medicine.The book is easily read. And humorous too. But why mix his insights in hypnosis and psychology with religion and fake psychics. What's the connection to the way we let ourselves be conned again and again by the same stupid coin-trick? Well, obviously because these are the things that occupy his strange mind, but also because, as you will see if you read the book, they are connected through the way our brain plays tricks on us constantly. And that's why I decided to give the book 5 dazzling stars. It all adds up in the end. This is truly a book about ""The Tricks of the Mind"", and Derren Brown speaks right out of the bag.After finishing the book I looked at it and thought: ""That was weird! But definitely in the good way."". I mean, what should I expect from a true illusionist and con? ... ! I jumped in my seat, and quickly checked my pockets, and wouldn't have been surprised if something had been missing... "
8,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"Amusing and humble, the famous illusionist opens here some doors to his universe, revealing in part what makes a good mental trick. Such glimpse at human psychology, body language, NLP and other interesting fields forms a quick but interesting read. True to himself, Derren Brown also sizes here an occasion to debunk some bullshit, from the paranormal industry to, being himself a former Christian, the fallacies lurking behind any irrational thinking. Sadly, the whole is poorly structured - we go from one topic to the next quite randomly, it can be repetitive and, as it embraces many fields, some chapters will obviously be more interesting than others (depending on what the reader is looking for) which makes for an unequal read. Typical from Derren Brown, it remains however both entertaining and instructive. Not a must-have, but still a nice pick. "
9,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77901-kim,0,"So far, it is scary how much this man knows about the human brain! I have certain beliefs which (until now) I would have argued blind to defend. Now I am not so sure, afterall, as Derren put it himself - What is a belief, where do they come from and aren't we just subjective to what we really want to believe?I challenge you to read it!"
10,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005399-sam-fleming,3,"Before I review it, I’d better ‘fess up about my ambivalent feelings towards Mr Brown.I am not fond of hypnosis used for the purposes of entertainment. This is an understatement so vast you could use it as an air-craft carrier. It takes an effort of persuasion or morbid curiosity regarding a particular stunt for me to watch any such performance on the television. The only Derren Brown show I have ever enjoyed was the one in which he went around debunking charlatans who were profiting from the gullibility of others (the school teaching blind people to see energy, in an effort to give them the kind of preternatural sight afforded by melange overdose to Paul Atreides, was an excellent case in point). I found his Zombie show repellent, believing, as I do, very strongly in the notion of informed consent.My problem with Mr Brown comes down to that one critical idea: informed consent. As his show is one of magic and illusion, by its very nature he cannot explain how he does it. He is not the masked magician giving away Magic’s Greatest Secrets (not that I’m convinced by that, either). It is necessary for him to refrain from explaining himself and I appreciate that. It means, however, that the people he involves in his illusions and “experiments” cannot know precisely what he is going to do to them. It wouldn’t be so entertaining for the audience, otherwise. He needs them to be, as he describes the subject of Zombie in his book, of “naïve status”. Notwithstanding his insistence that“It is very important to me that they enjoy themselves immensely and finish with a very positive experience of the process.”I take issue with putting someone through any form of experience that, let’s be blunt, messes with his head, without prior full disclosure.We all know that what is written on the back of the book may not necessarily reflect what the author thinks the book is about. Mr Brown does this in the preface, explaining, by way of what is presented as an amuse boucheOn this front I have no disagreement. Mr Brown does indeed discuss the techniques he employs in his performances. He discusses mnemonics and hypnotism, sleight-of-hand and illusion, the power of persuasion, cold-reading, statistics, the way people are swayed by emotion, and the commonalities of the human experience that can be relied upon to make an individual treat a generic, stock answer as being a treatise on the dark corners of her soul. What it does not do is tell you exactly how he performs any one of his particular tricks. Indeed, he specifically says that he deliberately obfuscates so that what might look like a memory trick is actually manipulation and misdirection and vice versa.Do not buy this book expecting to find out precisely how he pulled off Russian Roulette, or how he made a table levitate for Dr Robert Smith of UCL (although there is a good picture of the latter in the glossy middle pages). Do buy this book —or borrow it from a library— if you would like to read about Brown’s fascination with mnemonics and what he got up to as a student. Get it for the discussions of how what seems self-evident doesn’t hold up when analysed mathematically (always change your mind when presented with the last two boxes in the Monty Hall problem). If you liked the depiction of Hannibal Lecter’s Memory Palace you may well enjoy the exercises that start you on the road to creating your own.He has a bee in his bonnet about pseudo-science, which is fair enough. He is only slightly less harsh about homeopaths and alternative medicine practitioners than Ben Goldacre, although makes no mention of TAPL. He does, however, lump a big section of the environmental lobby (including, by textual proximity, Greenpeace) in with the anti-MMR brigade, and misrepresents the Precautionary Principle used in environmental protection to a degree that makes it seem like environmentalists are as risk-averse as the mythical PC Health & Safety brigade (the one that insists that a banana must be straight just in case someone wishes to use it for a purpose other than consumption and runs the risk of injury as a result of excessive curvature).He discusses, for instance, the banning of DDT and Carson’s Silent Spring, stating that he read in a book by Dick Taverne that “no tests have ever been replicated to show that DDT damages the health of human beings”, thereby missing the point of Carson’s work. Equally, GMO crops and the questions about growing them don’t have as much to do with their effect on the people eventually eating them as on the ecosystem as a whole. In slamming the green lobby for preferring “ideology over evidence” he shows a very human-centric view, and makes himself seem quantitatively, if not qualitatively, to be as much of an idealogue as those he is criticising; one that sees the odd scientific fact and juicy rational tidbit and pounces on it, much as he describes those who believe in spiritualism and horoscopes as doing. I suppose that this only goes to show that we all do it, whether we like it or not, and a little amount of knowledge can be a dangerous thing.I wouldn’t presume to offer an educated view on magic, memory and illusion. I appreciate Mr Brown’s desire to debunk charlatans and pseudo-scientists, but I do think he should be a bit more circumspect in how he chooses his examples.That aside, the book is far more entertaining than his television shows. I still will not be persuaded that the more extreme examples of what he does are not a form of assault that is television-friendly.At the end of the day, the book is also a performance. I doubt, despite his assurances, that the reader will learn much of the real Derren Brown. He swings from being deliberately self-deprecating to being self-aggrandising in a way that we are no doubt supposed to take tongue in cheek. On the other hand, as he says, who you are in an objective sense isn’t so much who you believe you are as how you present yourself. It’s not about what you think, feel or intend but about what you do. If what Derren Brown does is hypnotise people without asking into believing they are fighting zombies, or take potshots at the environmental movement because people who worry about the effect of bioaccumulative pesticides on apex predators are “eco-fundamentalists”, then I am content to carry on avoiding his shows and let him make his money from people who enjoy that sort of thing."
11,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10360599-alex-daniel,3,"Derren Brown’s Tricks of the Mind was released in 2007. Obligatory disclaimer: This book will not fully explain the tricks and illusions you see on television. Instead, this book covers basic cognitive principles that allow these illusions to happen.Derren Brown’s Tricks of the Mind is a good book; it covers a good bit of information on memory, suggestibility, and body language. It’s good, but it’s hard to recommend to others. The book begins with the idea that you know who Derren Brown is and that you are at least a little familiar with his television specials. What you will learn in this book is filtered through Derren Brown’s prose, which is scattered, tangential, and often humorous. Too often though, it felt as if passages that went on too long were placed just to increase the word count. Additionally, the material covered in this book is so scattered that it often feels disjointed. With exception of the chapter on memory, most of the material is covered at a level that is too shallow to gain much practical use of; instead, a good portion of this book serves as a primer for other subjects (like skepticism, suggestibility, or unconscious communication).That’s the bad stuff. The good news is that Tricks of the Mind is quite fun. Many of the anecdotes are humorous (again, you are required to know who Derren Brown to find these at all interesting) even if they aren’t directly related to the content on hand. The tone of the book varies from self-aggrandizing to self-deprecating, but it always tries to engage and humor the reader. The most useful chapter is probably Memory, as it includes many things you can put into practice in your daily life. Now, these techniques are not novel, but they are written in a very accessible way. I would almost recommend this book based on the chapter alone. Familiar psychological methods are brought up (linking, method of loci, peg system), but this book treats them as fun exercises rather than tedious phenomenon. Another thing I really appreciated was Brown’s skepticism to his own anecdotes — while he is a hypnotist, he doesn’t make any ridiculous claims that aren’t confirmed by scientists. The latter half of the book serves as a polemic against pseudoscience, mysticism, psychics, and other forms hogwash. The end of the book provides a great list of books that are worth reading; it’s just nice that they are all listed in one convenient location for people who may be interested in pursuing more skeptic literature.I think a lot of the material covered here is of interest to many, but I think the way it is written and the way that subjects are handled makes the barrier to entry a little higher than it ought to be."
12,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816075-redfox5,3," I had the wrong idea about Derren Brown. I'd never seen him on tv, just thought he was some silly magician who brought in to all that medium/hypnotist rubbish. My sister informed me this was not correct and gave me a copy of the book.  This is the kind of book that appeals to me, I don't believe in any of that rubbish and Brown does a wonderful job of informing us how the ""experts"" make people believe. It's all in the mind, something which I often tell people who swear blindly they've seen ghosts. I used to think I saw ghosts, I grew up and realised it was my imagination. As a book reader having a vivid and over active imagination comes easy to me. I can create a world inside my head instantly and clearly. Which is why I know that my mind will see things that are not there. It's bloody powerful. But maybe some people who are not used to this kind of imagination, you know, those people who think books are boring and they would just rather wait for the film to do all the work for them, find the thought of such an imagination unnatural and would rather see ""ghosts"". Someone one should look into that, see if there is any connection?  I really hate mediums, you can't talk to the dead. There is no one to talk to because they are dead. And the dead can't talk. They prey upon the grief stricken and the weak and it winds me up. My mum saw a medium, the medium said one of your children is surrounded by photos, so many photos. My mum assumed they were talking about me as I take lots of them, just like millions of other Facebook users. What a guess..... I'm sounding a little outraged today and it's nothing to do with the book. It's Russell Brand who's wound me up today saying that a vote for Labour was a vote for democracy, conveniently forgetting that if Labour get in they don't want the people to be allowed their say on the EU...urrm is that not how democracy works? And while I was trying to read my mind kept drifting back to this and all the sheep who are following him. Argg! Okay rant over back to the book.  I found the first half to be dull. I have no interest in learning any mind control tricks, and there are several times you are urged to put the book down and have a go. I wasn't really interested in having a go and skipped some parts. As noted above, the cynic in me was loving the discrediting parts and Brown is genuinely funny.  If you hold all these methods in high esteem then you are going to be just as outraged by this book as I am about Brand. I'm sure it will make for some pretty entertaining reviews. :) "
13,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,4,"I thought the book was ok overall and actually very funny in places if you can understand his sarcasm! The book is about mind tricks and hypnotism among other mind related stage activities Derren takes you through. There are some funny stories to keep you amused through the book although at the end it gets into the psychosis side of things which I found personally a bit boring. There were a few really good memory tricks which I have started applying already. Other chapters covered coin tricks, suggestion techniques, memory tricks, hypnosis, language, NLP, personal change, curing phobias, playing with pictures, spotting lies, unconscious communications, thinking traps and psychics. I have to admit that I always got him and paul mckenna mixed up."
14,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20728427-tom-oldale,4,"An excellently written and genuinely funny insight into magic, memory, hypnosis and scepticism. I really enjoyed this book and read it within a week as it is brilliantly organised into bite sized sections all as fascinating as the last. Some of you like me will get very little from sections like magic (as I have no interest in being a magician) but those sections are still interesting and within this book I’m sure is something of interest to everyone especially if you have even a minor interest in psychology. The techniques, experiments and science explained in this book is truly intriguing and with Brown’s writing style becomes perfectly accessible. Derren Brown obviously has a comprehensive understanding of the human mind and how to best manipulate it within his shows and this book gives you a fairly although not completely in-depth look into the techniques used. The only issue I had with it is if you are already a fan of Derren Brown and/or have an interest in psychology as I do, you will find yourself very often already knowing a lot of what is explained here. The book is I dare to say it, preaching to the converted in the last quarter in terms of pseudo-science and psychics etc. Still, the content and writing style makes this book a great read for any fan of Derren Brown and I think even more importantly it is a great read for someone who hates Derren Brown but maybe likes healing crystals and psychics, you could learn a lot from this if you allow your mind to be opened just a little to the facts. "
15,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75634790-jeremy,4,"Derren Brown has a real talent for engaging his audience, be it with his stage performance or, as I have just discovered reading this book, in his writing. The author gives very some very interesting explanation on the general principle of ""how it is all done"". That made me go back to watching his shows with increased pleasure. He does keep the details of his performance secret though, which is probably for the best.Highly recommended. "
16,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2002725-terry-clague,2,"Derren Brown's first UK television series, Mind Control, aired before the turn of the millennium and was head-bendingly good telly which led Charlie Brooker to comment that the man was ""either a balls-out con artist or the scariest man in Britain."" A quote which adorns the front cover of my copy of this book, and why not?The author seems to be very likeable* and charming but, alas, the book itself is over-written to within an inch of its breadth. Almost to the extent that you are reminded of how he talks, which one always assumed was puposefully verbose to disguise the aforementioned mind control. This is a shame, since there's a better book buried in the pages which could connect his experience of showmanship, salesmanship and pseudo-science with the modern frustrations, such as political rhetoric - ""a politician knows that if he fires a set of confusing statistics at listeners, followed by a 'summing up', they are more likely to believe that concluding statement.""* evidenced by an amusing, over-written, and self-mocking, story he recounts from the period where he was preparing to film his astonishing Russian Roulette show, during the course of which he stayed with a fried in Bristol... ""The flat was on the top floor, and there were many flights of stairs to descend to reach the front door of the house. One morning I was being picked up to be taken off for some typically glamorous filming, and I quickly jogged down the stairs with the natural pace of one who has four floors to work his way down and no desire to spend more time than necessary doing it. I had no idea at the time that my flies were undone. Worse, I was around the time experimenting with the uncanny freedom provided by the manly boxer short, and Fortune;s hand had that morning blearily fumbled in the smalls drawer of Providence and decided that such swaddling would serve as the day's netherwear of choice.So I was hurriedly bouncing down the many stairs with not only trouser boldly undone, but also private shorts jostling ajar. As I alighted from the bottom stair a key sounded in the lock of the front door, and I passed a couple coming in as I left. I wished them a bright and cheerful 'Good Morning!' as I was aware that they might possibly recognise me. I was being more careful than usual to be charming. It was only when I stepped outside into the bracing September air and felt almost immediately an algid breeze in a most surprising area that I realised that I had left the house with my cock hanging out. A moment's reflection told me that I had passed the couple at the door in the same state. I have no idea if they noticed, and with time I have learned to cling to the possibility that they might have brushed past me and not seen, but again the fear: 'Derren Brown? Yes, we met him once. His cock hangs out.' Putting a gun to my head came quite naturally after that."""
17,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27821653-rljulie,5,"I save five stars for books I re-read or refer to later or pass on to friends. This is an old one, but so full of such necessary human information that I find myself passing it along quite frequently. To me, this book is best not for entertainment value, but for a simplified way of understanding how we think, and many of the ways that our brains can work against us in everyday life. Knowledge is power, and this book is an entertaining way to make your life more ""illusion-proof"".The things that stand out about this book, as I recall it:1)It's where I learned about ""Barnum statements"". It astounds me how long these have been working, and how effective they are on normally intelligent people, and how resistant people are to being told their astrologist/fortune teller/minister/therapist is just giving them basic cold readings. Brown demonstrates how our need to believe we're ""special"" and ""unique"" actually makes us, in fact, just like everybody else.2) It demonstrated the importance of looking at techniques of emotional manipulation, indoctrination, hypnosis, and brainwashing. When one knows what's going on, one is less easily fooled by these techniques.3) It teaches practical memory exercises. Brown outlines a few of these that, in the years since I first read this, I have practiced and used to great effect in my everyday life. I wish I could take it to the ""genius"" level, but in the meantime, it's helpful to have an easy way to remember what I meant to do today, or my grocery list. This is practical and helpful information you don't often find.In short, I often find people in the world making outrageous claims of various sorts, and I wish I had a copy of this book to hand them, and say ""Yeah, it's not that complicated. It's just due to the basic way our brains work. Here, read this: it's fun, funny, and will teach you a thing or two besides."""
18,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35105125-samuel-tyler,2,"I have come to realise that I don’t like being taught. At school I would find it hard to concentrate on work that did not interest me, whilst things that excited me I would have an almost photographic memory of. For this reason I am a fiction lover and not non-fiction. I would much rather learn from a story and hope that the author has done their research, rather than be preached to by a textbook. I was hoping that ‘Tricks of the Mind’ by Derren Brown would buck this trend as he is a very personable TV personality and I believed that if anyone could make learning a bit more interesting, it would be him.In part I was right. ‘Tricks’ is essentially a 101 guide to many of the tricks of his trade from basic magic, hypnotism and using words to distract a person. All these elements could be fun to learn, but you need to study to get good at them. At times this book does feel like a textbook that drones on in detail about technique. For someone genuinely thinking about taking on the role of a mesmeriser it will hold many juicy titbits, but for someone just looking to be entertained, it can be very dry.This dryness is made even more apparent by the fun sections that pepper the educational section. Every now and again Brown tells a small vignette of his life. This autobiographical sections are far more interesting and you end up gleaning the book for them. Perhaps I came to this book with the wrong frame of mind, but I still think an educational book on magical techniques could have been a little more fun. If someone was truly planning to become a magician they could pick up some other dull volumes, Brown could have said a little less about practical magic and talked more about himself."
19,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5200063-andrew,5,"Really interesting book - I got stuck in to the section on memory, and decided to memorize the periodic table as a small exercise. It was surprisingly easy - admittedly I had to fine-tune some of the techniques once I had learned them, but the results were incredible really! It would be diffcult to learn the periodic table just by repetition ( I did the majority of the work in under two hours ), and far too time consuming! However, if you learn a few simple techniques, you could surprise yourself like I did. Of course, there are other good books on memory also, and there is much more to this book than the one subject I have outlined above ( Although that subject was the one I got involved in quite heavily ), so this gets a five star review.

20,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14728255-elisabeth,5,"Absolutely brilliant. So enthralling I had to finish it even though my eyes were already closing due to late hour. Not to mention his great tricks and exercises that the reader can benefit from, his witty manner of writing numerous funny stories make it such an enthralling but critical piece of writing. Just brilliant!"
21,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21845605-david,5,"Wonderful, clever, exciting - and rather scientific too. I enjoyed his gentle charm and perspicacious views. This put me back into that enjoyment of magic I had lost years ago."
22,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31098228-joey-vissers,5,One of the best books I have ever read. It is fun to read and Derren gives you a wide range of information of how he does his tricks.I can only say I hope he keeps making these kind of books.
23,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,4,"In this book, Derren Brown, famous British ""illusionist, mentalist, trickster, hypnotist, painter, writer, and sceptic"", sets out to reveal the secrets of his work and actually tell people ""I have no real powers, and I hope this settles it!"". We get to see all of the above sides of his: amazing breakdowns of his work and shows and spectacular analyses of what parts of human psychology and neurology he manipulates and why. Most of all, however, we see his sceptical side. Derren Brown dedicates the majority of his book and prose on an excellent and thorough debunking of things like parapsychology, homeopathy and alternate medicine. He goes through them with an aura of ""I would like these things to exist but they cannot, and here's why"". The idea is that they're all a mix of delusions, confirmation bias, psychological tricks and many other ""flaws"" of the human psyche he actually explains are the reason he can trick people.Now, my personal opinion still is that the scientific method is far from perfect and that a lot of what we see that works in these fields but shouldn't, based on what we can know and understand about the world, is not necessarily less real than what can be proven; conversely, the scientific dogma is trying to concvince us that if it can't be proven, it shouldn't work. However, anecdotal evidence from countless sources (which Mr. Brown rejects based on the fact that they cannot be integrated into a greater theory, but how could they ever be?) tells us a different story.Repeatabiliy, correlations between cause and effect and the need for evidence are concepts inseparable from the scientific method, but the scientific method is only one way of looking at things. You might say it is the one that works more reliably, but that doesn't mean that it always works or even that reliability should be our end-all-be-all criterion when creating our world theories. For example, how does reliability and repeatability fit in with the double slit experiment? Or how about the decline effect (excellent article by the New Yorker), which questions the whole idea that once something is proven, it should be able to be repeatedly proven anew? What if it fails to? Is it a problem of the experiment or an incompatibility of the nature of things with the idea that, given the same known and unknown conditions, A should always lead to B? Maybe Douglas Adams had it right all along:“There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”In short: if Derren Brown is an open-minded sceptic, I choose to be the unorthodox researcher, the explorer of the fringes, the one who looks for the truth that slips between the seams, what gets misunderstood by the scientists of its time, ridiculed, rejected by the dominant paradigm, including the rhetoric of this book of course. ""I have the rational intelligence to be a scientist, but it's not in my personality to fill in cracks in established mental models. I seek anomalies that open cracks."" ~Ran Prieur (there's more from him coming up)I believe that the author's bias towards positivism is a resulf of him, as discussed in the book, being religious at a young age and at some point changing sides completely. Since then he seems to have kept insisting that the paranormal or parapsychology must have the same psychological root as religious belief. This is a bias which can also be seen in the studies he chooses to cite to prove his points, as well as the books he recommends at the end of the book for further reading; most of them are, predictably, reinforcing what he already talked about in the book - more scepticism in line with The God Delusion (which I'm curious to read). Is he making the same mistake of maintaining reverse cognitive and confirmation biases, the very same thing he set out to point out to us that everyone is doing?All that said, even if I disagree with his scope and can see the limitations of his argument (which could be a cognitive bias of my own, mind you), I did enjoy his argumentation and have to commend his style. He didn't insult people who fall into the cognitive mistakes he outlines and who believe in these irrational behaviours he has taken advantage of to become who he is now; he didn't try to hold the scepticist view just to prove a point or win the argument, as too many people to count are used to doing, themselves becoming the very zealots they swore to destroy; he was gentle and careful with his explanations and approached the topics with an genuinely, not just a supposedly, open mind; his whole style gave off the impression that he is actually interested in the truth, that he has the real spirit of a researcher and isn't just the pretention of one. If we disagree in scope and -naturally- look at things from different perspectives... So be it. All I know is that I gained something from his healthy scepticism and his book is now serving as a platform for further investigation of mine in all directions.An excellent example: from the 
books
 section of Ran Prieur's website:Charles Fort was the first paranormal investigator, and he's my favorite natural philosopher. He spent 27 years in libraries collecting notices of physical phenomena unexplainable by science, and put them together into four books in the 1920's. You don't have to be into weird stuff to appreciate his style of thinking: that all our attempts to make sense of the world only seem true by excluding stuff at the edges that doesn't fit, and we can keep updating and revolutionizing our models to fit new observations, but there is no end to this process. This should not make us feel troubled, but awe-struck and amused. The Book of the Damned is Fort's first and best book, and his one-volume Complete Books are still in print. Here's another source of Fort online.[...]I've been into paranormal and new age writing for most of my life. My advice is not to exclude it completely or your mind will become cramped and inflexible. It's safe to dip your toes into it, but if you go into it deeply, you have to commit to going all the way through. Because you'll reach a point where your mind cracks open and you'll think you suddenly Know the Truth, and you'll be tempted to stop and set up camp. You must not stop, but keep looking at different perspectives. Then you'll think, wait, now this is the Truth, and now this... Hold on here! It's looking like reality itself is so packed and multifaceted that it's easy to make any nutty system of thought seem like the Truth -- including the dominant paradigm itself. Now you're getting it!The smartest and most thorough book on the ""paranormal"" is The Trickster and the Paranormal by George P. Hansen. Even though his writing style is aggressively clear, it's still hard to read because the ideas are so difficult. He covers anthropology, literary theory, shamanism, stage magic, UFO hoaxes, psychic research, and more, and the general idea is that it's the very nature of these phenomena to only exist on the fringes. How can this work? The answer is simple but sounds so crazy that even Hansen only hints at it. Another big idea is that real unexplained phenomena and hoaxes are not opposites, but blend together.I love the books of Fortean paranormal researcher John Keel. They're all great, but my two favories are The Mothman Prophecies and The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings. Like Keel, I think UFO's are an occult phenomenon (which means something very hard to explain), and an even smarter author who thinks like this is Jacques Vallee, whose most important book is Passport to Magonia.A great source for all kinds of fringe books is Adventures Unlimited.Some books that try to merge woo-woo stuff with hard science: The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot, The Field by Lynne McTaggart, and The Self-Aware Universe by Amit Goswami. And for a critique of the untested assumptions that underlie science as we know it, check out The End of Materialism by Charles Tart or The Science Delusion by Rupert Sheldrake.[...]So when Wilhelm Reich developed physical tools to work with the esoteric energy he called ""orgone"", or when Royal Rife cured serious diseases with precise frequency generators, or when Louis Kervran found biological creatures transmuting chemical elements (his book is Biological Transmutations), or for that matter, when ordinary people experience UFO abductions or miraculous healings, these are not hoaxes or delusions. They are honest and accurate observations that fail to be integrated into consensus reality... so far!*deep breath* Okay. I've written this much already and I haven't even mentioned any of the more practical things covered. Mr. Brown included tricks for improving one's memory and memorising things (like the incredible Method of Loci), techniques for spotting lies and deception, and others shared with the foundation of NLP for disconnecting with bad memories and reinforcing positive visualisations. You can even find the fundamentals of hypnosis in there, but it's a topic which, to be honest, he muddled through, unable to tell us precisely or convincingly what it is but very keen on telling us what it isn't. Now all I'm left with is ""what's hypnosis finally?""Yes. This review is too long. If you skipped to the end, let me tell you that this book is worth it. It will make you think and it will make you look into real techniques that are both impressive and useful, if only you can just sit down and practice them (which it's doubtful I will, not because of lack of interest but because of lack of dedication - for now). To think I haven't even watched his shows..."
24,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,4,"I love the way this guy writes (or maybe it's his writing partner). Hilarious. I was just disappointed that so much of the book was about stuff I'd already read about a number of times: memory tricks, pseudo-science, and spiritualism.My favorite part was the preface; here's part of that: Some time last spring I thought I would visit Her Majesty's Fish in the aquarium, which sits beneath the gently disappointing London Eye not far from our production offices. At the time I had just had a fish-tank installed at home and was looking for sea-monsters with which to fill it. Tentacled, multi-limbed, slithering creatures which are entirely at home only when attacking submarines or James Mason were what I was after, and the thought of visiting a place where such things as giant octopodes (I notice that Microsoft is not only unhappy with the correct plural, but also allows octopi, which those of you who delight in annoying others will know is in fact wrong) might glare at me through toughened and confusingly-focused glass struck me as far too exciting for words. As it turned out, Zone Twelve of the Aquarium was irksomely short on invertebrates of any sort, and the highlight of the afternoon proved to be looking at an enormous American lady squashed against the glass from the opposite window of the shark tank. I was, throughout my tour of largely similar fish, doing my best to read the little plaques next to each tank, which told me and other curious visitors the name, feeding habits and musical tastes of whatever was diving, swimming or floating upside-down inside. About halfway through this fabricated subterranean labyrinth, my conscious mind suddenly latched onto an oddity. I realized that underneath the descriptions of the various natant ichthyoids there was a translation of what I presumed to be the same information in Braille. For a while this seemed quite natural, and then I caught myself wondering:on average, how many blind people a year visit the London Aquarium? Now I don't wish to sound insensitive, but I imagine the number must be negligible. I would welcome any answers from blind people to a couple of questions that have been bugging me since. Firstly, how do you know where the Braille sign is located? This must be relatively straightforward in such things as lifts, but what about in an alien environment? If alone in a train toilet, how does one find Braille instructions for the use of obscured or unusual soap dispensers or toilet flushes? That sounds like an unpleasant and even unhygienic search to be undertaking while bumping around somewhere near Didcot Parkway. My second concern, clearly, is if a blind visitor found the Braille sign in the Aquarium, of what earthly use would it be? Aside from possible fleeting strokes of a passing stingray in the 'touching pool', the London Aquarium seems to be an experience ill suited to visitors with severe visual challenges. It occurred to me that the Braille signs, if located, would at best provide the blind visitor with no more to take with him from his afternoon than a list of fish. A list of fish.... So, taking on board the wide range of people who might watch my shows, I have tried to pitch this book to the intelligent reader with a layman's interest in things mind-related. Some of those things I feel passionately about and others are drier subjects:I just offer my thoughts at the level at which they occur in my enormous round bearded head. The subjects covered the diverse, and some are a little more academic in tone than others. Equally, I have rejected the option of writing an anemically 'light' introduction to exciting mind-feats, which would make for easy reading and quick writing but would undoubtedly be misleading,and instead incorporated a level of skepticism where I feel it is important. This comes from a desire to make the contents of the book as worthwhile and unpatronizing as possible('patronizing,' of course, means 'to talk down to people'). I do hope that you are inspired to delve further into one or more of the areas to which this book will introduce you;if not, it should make an excellent and inexpensive bath-toy for your least favorite child. I would love to feel that this book can give you information you can apply practically, or use as a springboard for further useful discovery. That would be my aim. I would hate you to leave with just a list of fish.Misc. other quotes:We should all go together to a magic convention. They are extraordinary events, at once both unintentionally hysterical and staggeringly depressing. One year I was attending such a convention inLlandudno and was walking back to my hotel in the early hours of the morning. I had quite long hair at the time, as well as the Emperor Ming goatee, and was wearing a velvet jacket, waistcoat and fob watch; in those days I thought I had an old-world dapper charm, when in fact I looked like a gay time-traveller. Signs of TruthfulnessSometimes it is easier to identify signs that a story is true rather than look for elusive lying tells. German psychologists have developed the popular Statement Validity Assessment to be used in cases of alleged sexual offenses to children, to determine the credibility of the child’s testimony. At the heart of the SVA isa nineteen-point list which forms the criteria-based content analysis phase of the assessment. Here we see a number of signs which point to a credible testimony which are of use to us here. If someone is telling you a story which you believe may not be true, it is worth being aware of some of these points. Aldert Vrij discusses the system in his book Detecting Lies and Deceit, which is where I first came across it. Since then I have found myself using it as a checklist when listening to people’s stories. The list also represents a lovely insight into the sorts of patterns we all fall into when relating events. Here are the most valuable criteria from the system:1.Unstructured productionTruthful stories, unless they have been told many times, tend to involve all sorts of jumping forwards and backwards across the timeline of the narrative. A person will ge tso far into a story and commonly have to backtrack to give background information on something which he realizes is about to come up. While we tend to feel we’ve ruined a story by doing this, it is in fact an extremely common pattern. Equally, a person may well tell the story not from the start but rather by explaining the essential point they want to communicate first before then filling in the background and providing the narrative. The chronology will most likely be all over the place,especially if the story is emotive and relatively fresh.2.Quantity of detailsThe richer the details, the more likely the story is to be true. As we have already discussed, a typical liar will not elaborate on details when questioned about the specifics of an event. He’ll just tend to repeat himself. An openness to providing additional information is a good sign of truthfulness.3.Contextual embeddingThis occurs when the person places events within the context of his daily life rather than as isolated events which sound like they could have occurred in a vacuum. For example, ‘I was just sitting outside in the garden to relax a bit after cleaning the kitchen – the sun had just come out and I didn’t fancy watching Countdown which I normally would, so I thought I’d sit on the patio for a bit.’ These contextual references tend not to appear when the story is a fake.4.Descriptions of interactionsTruthful stories are more likely to involve details about how the person interacted with other key characters. For example, ‘I asked him what he was doing there, and he laughed weirdly – so I felt a bit threatened and backed off a bit.’5.Reproduction of speechFew liars will reproduce parts of a dialogue in their stories, preferring instead to report what was said rather than say it in the story. For example, ‘I said, “Don’t do that you’ll mess it up,”’ is more likely to point to a true story than ‘I told him not to do it or he’d mess it up.’6.Unexpected complications during the incident If the story contains neither interruptions nor unexpected events that interfere with its flow, it’s less likely to be true.7.Unusual detailsThese are details offered along the way that stand out. For example, the fact that a person in the story had a gold tooth. Details may be superfluous to the main flow of the story.8.Accurately reported details misunderstoodClassically, this would involve a child too young to understand sexual activity talking about a perpetrator’s sexual actions in naïve terms. But it can happen in other contexts; an event might be referred to where its meaning was lost on the person relating the story, but is understood by the interviewer.9.Accounts of subjective mental stateHere we would expect the person to refer to how she was feeling at different times in the story, or what thoughts were going through her head.10.Attribution of the perpetrator’s mental stateHere, the person describes how another character in the story seemed to be feeling. For example, ‘He was clearly annoyed because he took his glasses off and raised his voice.’11.Spontaneous correctionsLittle corrections or dropped-in additions make a story more convincing. Here are both: ‘He was using his laptop to write – he had one of those little Sony Vaios – and sat there for hours and only ever ordered a coffee. Well, no, he did get a muffin at one point,but he was there for ages.’12.Admitting lack of memoryA truth-teller has no need to worry about spontaneously admitting lapses of memory or details he cannot remember whilst telling the story. It would be quite normal for him to say something like, ‘Can’t remember why we were there but we were all staying at this hotel.’However, this criterion is not fulfilled by giving an answer such as ‘I don’t know’ to a direct question. 13.Raising doubts about one’s own testimonyThe truthful person might admit that certain parts of the story might be wrong or misremembered.14.Self-deprecationHere the person refers to details which might incriminate himself or make himself look foolish. E.g., ‘That was my own fault, I knew I shouldn’t have left him alone.’Sometimes this may extend to pardoning the guilty party in the story altogether.Its importance was discovered around the end of the Second World War by an American anesthetist,Henry Beecher. He found that he could administer a saline solution instead of morphine to terribly wounded soldiers before an operation and not only would they experience greatly reduced pain, they also wouldn’t suffer from the cardiovascular shock that is expected during operations or amputations without a painkiller."
25,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,3,"Picked this book up because of Happy. Reads like a mish-mash of different books, including Harry Lorrayne’s Memory Book, Ben Goldarce’s Bad Science, and Tversky and Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow. Still a decent and amusing introduction to some Tricks of the mind. __ Uninformed strong opinions – and I particularly include religious ones, which for some reason get special treatment – are of course mere clusters of prejudices and no more appropriate than mine, yours, or anyone else’s are on topics we don’t understand. The more experienced performer knows the value of relaxing across a reliable off-beat to render his moves invisible. For this reason, often the more attentive a spectator is, the easier he is to fool. Notes, electronic or otherwise, are only there when you choose to look at them, and there is no particular incentive to check them or carry out the tasks they contain.The way we represent an image to ourselves (in terms of things like colour, size and placement) makes a huge difference in how we emotionally respond to it, and somehow the naturally amusing and rich images of the loci system make those tasks more immediate and appealing. What you mean to be is not what you are. What you mean to communicate about yourself is not the point: it is actually what you communicate that is the important fact. People never think it’s ‘really them’. The word bitch, for example, refers to how you communicate and deal with people, not some truth about your soul. Left on your own on a desert island, you can’t be a bitch; it takes communication with other people for that word to mean anything. I don’t think that ‘confidence’ exists any more than ‘motivation’ really exists. If you feel you’re under-motivated, consider this: the word is used only by people who say they don’t have it. People who are ‘motivated’ rarely use such a term to describe themselves. They just get on with the task at hand. In the case of confidence, there is no difference between someone who is ‘really’ confident and someone who is just behaving so. In social life we are defined by our actions, not by our motive; our thoughts or intentions mean very little unless they lead to action. It’s how we behave, or even sometimes how much we make the effort to be nice, that makes all the difference. The use of disorientating techniques to amplify a person’s responsiveness to suggestion is a classic ploy of talented persuaders. In effect, we are offered relief from the confusion and we happily do what we’re told (by politicians, salespeople or teachers). Forer effect: People will happily find a stock reading such as the above powerfully accurate and personal, even though the statements are applicable to a vast number of people, particularly of a certain age group. The comfort that can be taken from this exercise is that we all share the same sorts of insecurities. In particular, bright people in their twenties tend to be quite self-involved, wondering what their ‘real’ self consists of, prone to introspection, and very aware of conflicting aspects of their personalities. If statements made by the medium don’t hit, they can be turned into predictions for the future, or which might have happened outside the person’s knowledge. By far the most reliable gauge of an audience’s interest is the extent to which they cough. A cough is a clear sign that a person has detached a little from the show and is getting fidgety.  I have heard that putting on a show is ‘the art of stopping people coughing’. And if people are losing interest and starting to cough, you must become quieter. By doing so the audience has to quieten to hear you, and an unconscious cue goes out into the auditorium that something of interest is occurring."
26,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58530751-james,4,"The title is a bit of a cop out, as essentially this is a mixture of techniques that will help you understand the mind, and random thoughts that are at best peripheral to the topic at hand. However, I find Derren interesting and engaging, and I'm in agreement with much of what he says. Unfortunately, his pompous attitude is unavoidable and detracts from what could have been a less irritating final product.The guide part of this was interesting, and I will definitely try his peg system for numbers having been convinced by his method to remember a list in order (and surprised to learn this technique was suppressed centuries ago because it encouraged impure imagination). But he also discussed how to perform 'magic tricks' and look out for body language cues - I have read about lying before but here there was more discussion on actions, rather than just the words. There was also a lot of interesting discussion relating the theory to real life examples, and Brown is good at making these relevant and interesting (which is also true of his later book Happy). Unfortunately, I'm guessing in a bid to add some personality, he also uses unnecessarily and intentionally unusual vocabulary regularly, which really detracts from the good points he generally makes.The other aspect of the book, though linked to some of the mind techniques, is a discussion of his act and the associated world of psychics and mediums, and to an extent religion. In many repsects this is preaching to the converted in my case, but the discussion of morality is interesting, as well as decisions of what he did or didn't include in his television shows. He stops shorts of condemning all psychics to my surprise, just the more unpleasant aspects. I was also surprised that he was fairly favourable towards NLP and where we look when speaking giving clues as to what we are really thinking - it wasn't made clear why he seemed to think this had merit despite little in the way of scientific proof.If a book is really meant to challenge your beliefs, this also made me think about how I act. The quote below is one that I want to commit to memory because it makes a really good point, and while it brings to mind various people at work, the sentiment could probably apply to the times when I'm feeling less sociable:""The woman who sent the nasty emails was being a horrendous bitch because she expressed herself like one. End of story, regardless of whether or not she thinks that's 'really her'. People never think it's 'really them'."""
27,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32327144-steve-higgins,4,"Derren Brown is an enigmatic TV fella whose shows are a sort of combination of magic, psychology, hypnotism and some just general weird spooky stuff. I’m not sure what I was expecting from his book, I suppose I guessed it was a sort of autobiography of sorts but in fact it’s really about the things that interest the author, pretty much in the realms of magic, psychology and hypnotism and have contributed towards his performances both on the stage and on TV.He starts off with a little background to magic and how it works, things like sleight of hand and then how the magician uses various techniques to divert attention away from something that he doesn’t want you to see to something he wants you to see.Another interesting technique, vital to a magician is memory. Imagine a magician, or anyone for that matter being able to memorise an entire shuffled deck of cards. Sounds impossible doesn’t it but no, it can be done by using various methods which the author describes which are also pretty good for remembering anything like passwords, telephone numbers or shopping lists for instance. The way to do it is by linking something –whatever it is you are trying to remember- to something you can remember like a really striking image. So when trying to remember the name of a new acquaintance called Mike for instance, we should create an image of someone with a really big nose, shaped like a mic –a microphone.There are more highly interesting sections on hypnotism, and body language and then the author moves on to discrediting things like mediums who try to contact the spirit world. Everything they do he claims can be done by ‘cold reading’ a way of interpreting not only body language but verbal language tricks too. Overall a fascinating book but one theme that Derren plays too much with is how he has rejected Christianity because science cannot prove that Jesus was who he says he is, the son of God and has been resurrected. Surely Derren especially should realise that everything is not as it seems."
28,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54269944-james-taylor,3,"The book is part autobiography and part psychology. Derren discusses his opinions about card tricks, hypnotism, psychic mediums, religion and psychology. It’s a bit all over the place, and Derren does acknowledge this in his closing notes.Derren loves throwing big words around, especially early on in the book, and in that sense it reminded me of the comedian David Mitchell. It’s well written, but he often took me by surprise by throwing in a random reference/example which seemed out of left-field. So will be discussing something serious then throw in a sexual reference. Those moments are strange but made me laugh.He has an extensive explanation of how he memorises words, by creating stories/codes/images and remembering that instead.I always wondered if there is any truth in hypnosis. I didn’t see how it was plausible and thought people seemed to be actors. When you see Derren’s TV shows, he says there are no actors, unless stated otherwise. Derren’s explanation of it seems to be of surprise that it “works” because he knows it is fake, and discusses some reasons why people may go along with it; such as not wanting to embarrass the performer, because other people were “hypnotised” and they don’t want to be the odd one out, and more. It still seems odd when you see clips of his show. I was watching a clip recently where someone sits in freezing water, but is hypnotised to think it is comfortable. When Derren dispels the suggestion, he suddenly jumps up as if it is too cold. However, he still took time to step out of the water, and didn’t appear to shiver.I don’t think the book gave too much away into Derren’s techniques but it does give you an insight into his interests and opinions."
29,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47069317-daniel-barenboim,2,"When you pick up this book and first start reading, you might suspect this is a book on magic. The book starts off with 2 magic tricks, these are the only things having to do with that subject. So forget about magic after these 2 extremely simple tricks. The book then digresses into a mixture of autobiography and rant about how the author doesn't like people who pretend to be something else (focused on performers in his relative industry). The second chapter dives into memory techniques including one of the most renowned in the world called ""The Memory Palace"". A brilliant technique but very briefly explained in this book. ""Moonwalking With Einstein"" covered this topic all around and without the added clutter. Chapter 3 attempts to tackle errors in human thinking. Susceptibility to believing in the paranormal, confirmation bias, placebo affect, etc. Thinking fast and slow is a much better book on this topic and most likely the original source for this information as many of the experiments performed and explained in that book have a link to the author himself. This book wasn't at all what I expected and perhaps my disappointment stems from me having read other books, better written, dedicated to each individual point. (Gave 3 stars because this book might actually lead people into exploring 2 very important ideas mentioned here. Self-deception and the memory palace technique.)"
30,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48288062-niall-o-conghaile,5,"I found my old copy of this while looking in a cupboard the other day, and I was reminded that I need to read it again because I loved reading it so much the first time! I'm a huge fan of Derren Brown the performer/magician, and I guess your enjoyment of his persona and stagecraft will have a big effect on whether or not you will enjoy his book. But if you are a fan and you haven't read it, you are in for a real treat! He writes superbly, and seamlessly blends memoir-esque annecdotes and stories (such as his awkward confrontation with fake-psychic Derek Acorah, or his narrow escape from a beating at the hands of a lovelorn, drunken Welshman) with insights into the mental tasks he has trained his mind to perform (eg complex schemes for memorising and recalling large ammounts of information, or methods for deflecting the attention of violent, lovelorn Wleshmen). Whether any of this is real or not I guess we will never truly know, but I personally don't think that matters as the journey Derren Brown takes us on is so much fun. "
31,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5767309-mex,5,"This really is a fascinating book, and one of the things that makes it so accurate are the reviews it's received here. The reviewers tend to fall into one of two groups 1) people who know what the book is about (there is a *VERY* big clue in its title) and are genuinely interested in the subject who tend to rate it very highly, and 2) People that are somehow surprised the well known outspoken sceptic Derren Brown is just as sceptical about the ridiculous nonsense they believe as the stuff they don't who tend to rate it much lower (presumably to teach that naughty doubting Mr. Brown a lesson). Despite the claims of some of the reviews here, there is actually very little about religion in the book, it is there, but it is largely just mentioned in passing when discussing other woolly thinking.If you are genuinely interested in how the human mind does (and does not) work, this book is well worth a read, hell there's even a couple of magic tricks thrown in for good measure."
32,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8776142-tim,3,"I saw Derren Brown perform at the Cort theater on Broadway and watched a couple of his online videos. He puts on an impressive performance and uses, or makes references to a number of skills that interest me so I picked up this book to know more. He covers specific techniques of magic, memory, hypnosis and suggestibility, unconscious communication (body and facial cues), and a grab-bag of ""bad thinking"" where he bashes religion, spiritualism, alternative medicine and the like. He raises some good points, but it would be more convincing if made a coherent case about what he believes is true, or at least unknown, instead of relying entirely on negative arguments.His writes in a breezy patter that is informative and entertaining, but is also strongly opinionated. There is not enough depth on any topic to offer more than an introduction, but there is a useful list of works for further reading (several of which I have reviewed)."
33,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29417693-phoebe,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the humorous was this was written. Considering this was written in the early 00s it's still very valid! In fact more people probably should have read this back then to bring them to where we are now faster. I loved his back story, for me it was very relatable as I was brought up in a Christian family and solidified my thoughts and ponderings as a child up until the adult I am today. The activities were also fun apart from the remebering of numbers but I was never going to manage that part.I've now found myself noticing certain elements of manipulation and suggestion on TV, film and politics of course. I would recommend anyone to read this book, especially those that are confident in their beliefs."
34,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4984338-mark,2,"This book felt very padded and often I skim read ends of pages as Derren had already come to a conclusion but waffled on.The book is about no particular thing but magic, phycology and mystism in general.Nothing is particularly profound and most points are fairly common sense.Derren's sarcastic, quipy tone does not work as well in print as it does in person and I found the cutting little comments he insets started to grate about a third in.There are some pictures in the middle of the book, most of which don't relate to the text as well as pages of further reading and correspondence from fans.It felt like it was a struggle to hit the minimum page count.For a short, big text book with lots of white-space this felt very long."
35,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/700527-kristen,4,"The thing that I enjoy most about Derren Brown is that he is really witty. The book is great as an introduction to nlp, hypnotism, spotting lies, and other mind tricks. The real beauty of reading it is all the crazy one liners that he sprinkles throughout the reading. My guess is that he puts those in there as a way to draw your mind back into the topic, with novelty. He actually has a line that reads, ""Allow me, my beautiful but well-informed bitches, to explain"", like wtf? Anyway, super fun.""Our level of personal conviction about a subject bears no relation to how true it is in the outside world."""
36,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"Derren is a really enjoyable writer and most of what he talked about I found very interesting. I was very familiar with the latter section of the book where he talked about mediums, alternative medicine, pseudoscience, etc. (a number of years ago I watched a LOT of Richard Dawkins videos) but I still found this section fairly engaging. I also really enjoyed most of the first half of the book where he talked about sleight of hand, tricks, mnemonics, etc. The only part that didn't really grip me was when he was giving an explanation of how to do hypnosis. I have no plans on hypnotising anyone, so this section was slightly tedious for me. Still, overall a very enjoyable read. "
37,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23726142-rhiannon,2,"Couldn't finish it. Derren is charming and interesting when he talks about his life, patronising when he tries to teach his methods, and insufferable when he talks about his beliefs.Nothing wrong with being an atheist, but the last 2/3 of this book dissolves into a reddit rant from circa 2011. Yeah we know you ""love ""science"""" (the inherent vagueness annoys me), but that's not a good premise for a book. Some people are wrong. Oh well. Say they're wrong, and move on.1 star for the bits where he loosens up somewhere in the middle, and the other for explaining the Monty Hall problem in a way even I could understand."
38,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83204830-luk-worknik,5,"Derren Brown is the master of mentalism and most recognized mentalist in the world. He wrote many mentalism books but this one is his best. Written in a comprehensible and humorous way that perfectly transmits the secrets of his mentalism.Derren will teach you how to properly use hypnosis, suggestion and how to read and use body language. The Mentalism presented in his book is easy to perform and memorize.I have used this book to create my website about Mentalism - http://mentalismlab.com/"
39,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16267693-pat-morris-jones,3,I initially loved this book. There are fabulous bits in it that are really interesting. However I ended up having a love/ hate relationship with the author. I’m sure he will be delighted as this is effect he wants. He is alternately funny and annoying. Opinionated and yet not endearing with it. I love Morrissey for his blatant terribleness but I couldn’t find the same love for Mr Brown. He is undoubtedly talented. He aims to be helpful. However I pretty much gave up. Read only to finish it and thus learned too little. 
40,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36289217-cassie,4,"A great insight into the mind of Derren Brown. I expected this book to be more of an autobiography, but I was presently surprised that it was actually a mixture of real life anecdotes, philosophical influences and critique. The writing style was very intelligent and witty and I have learnt a few skills that I have already demonstrated to friends. My only criticism is I would have loved a few more anecdotes, because his life seems to have been incredibly interesting."
41,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76310333-tim-godin,5,"This is a book that took four years to read, not because it's not engaging, but because I kept putting it down until I had time to really let the lessons sink in. Derren offers quick to read but difficult to master techniques and insights that can be used in everyday life. While I've finished the text, I still intend to go back and re-read and learn the techniques, they seem invaluable. He provides tonnes of supplemental material to dig into on every topic, as well. "
42,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60263771-dave-relph,4,"There are points at which this book doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, and a couple of sections that are rather uninteresting. That said, the majority of this is absolutely fascinating and every part that breaks down what's involved in Derren's work and explaining how various 'psychic' techniques work are fantastic. The memory exercises are fun to put into practice, with other practical tidbits dotted throughout the book to try, making it largely engaging."
43,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22210809-nick,5,"A delightful read. Contains some entertaining insights and secrets into Derren's mystifying trade. Also gets well into the sadly rarely taught areas of psychology such as critical thinking and cognitive biases. Lots of fun mind games that challenge our assumptions. Also investigates some of the most common areas of mysticism and charletonism that humans fall prey to, and how they work, or appear to."
44,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58166661-s-s,4,"I have been following Derren Brown's career for years now (in the non Annie Wilkes sense) so was very glad to finally be able to purchase this book recently. (I had been intending to buy it for quite a while.) I found it a fun, funny, interesting, informative read and it was nice to see some of his insights (re: memory tricks as well as card/coin tricks etc) as well as the techniques themselves. This is something I know that I will delve into again in the future."
45,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,4,"Brown's book is like Richard Dawkins meets Daniel Kahneman meets Dale Carnegie meets James Randi with a great chapter on tips to improve memory. And the writing is fairly funny. But if you've read the above authors/genres, and don't already like Derren Brown, this book probably won't do much new for you."
46,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6278392-darla-ebert,5,I learned a lot...mostly about how magic tricks are done and how fraudsters use our own minds and expectations to dupe us. Derren Brown is obviously intelligent and gifted and quite hilarious (I do enjoy his quirky writing style).I was sad for him that he renounced his faith...if in fact he ever actually had it.
47,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65827089-king-sroe,4,"Great book. Lots of cool stuff, this guy has a nice writing style or a cool way of saying things rather. The bit about pseudo science was rather boring and in fact I skipped a good portion of it and got to the cold reading."
48,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91546746-imogen-clowes,3,Really liked his way of thinking and rationale related to general society. I particularly liked the first half which was interactive and i hope to use his memory techniques which were interesting to try
49,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64151440-anthony-bunn,5,"This is and has been one of my favourite books for a long while.  Touching on a variety of different subjects from card tricks to human behaviour along with good humour right through, I love it! "
50,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44368116-anrich,5,Very well done! One of my favorites !
51,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57522180-wolfie,4,"Very insightful, a book to return to for reference"
52,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82559527-rachel,5,"Really fascinating, hilarious, and just a generally good read. Derren's voice and character comes through beautifully on each page, if you're familiar, I'm sure you'll find it delightful."
53,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15363980-daniela,3,"Enjoyed the contents of the book (four stars), but the translation (Finnish) was poor (minus one star. Too bad my library didn’t carry the original)."
54,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42067770-kate-hopkins,1,Quite astonishingly dull!
55,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61812078-guy-bracey,5,I have learnt so much from this book ! I think everyone should read this
56,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11626503-benjamin,3,"Much more dogmatic than some of his other books, and consequently much less pleasant to read."
57,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100966009-ben,3,A good insight into how Derren sees the world. There were some interesting revelations about psychology and hypnosis here that have stuck with me long after reading.
58,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88477431-vlado-kr-lik,0,a guide to the mental library of the society
59,1905026382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44302805-yan,4,4.5 Excellent and insightful read!
