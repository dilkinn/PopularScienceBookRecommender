Fundamental because it claims to be searching for the ultimate components of the universe. Peculiar because so much of what it has found about these components is counter-intuitive and frequently beyond imagination. As in science’s ancient matrix of theology, words fail, metaphors falter, and, for the layman at least, patience flags. The ‘layers’ of purported reality seem to multiply with every advance in thinking and technology. Whatever ‘fundamental’ means, it doesn’t carry that meaning for long. This seems to have become the essential ethos of experimental physics: If results aren’t surprising, they’re not valuable. Gone are the days (if they ever existed) when the aim of physics was to explain. Careers and reputations depend on confounding rather than confirming what we already know. One wonders whither the sociology of science as well as science itself?"

I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part... What is the pattern or the meaning or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent? - Richard Feynmanwe've heard the soundbites: the large hadron collider made possible the discovery of the higgs boson, the particle which gives mass to things. but, that doesn't help us too much. for one, we wonder, why does a particle need to give mass? why don't things simply just have mass? & why does the acquisition of knowledge nearly always seem to make things more complicated? it kinda does. no way around that. carroll explains that the higgs field fills space and interacts with the particles moving through it, giving some of them mass (well, giving mass to quarks, charged leptons, and the W&Z bosons… y'gonna have to read the book for the juicy details). the higgs boson is the particle we observe when we interact with a vibration in that field. carroll does a great job of explaining the difficult stuff (still haven't fully wrapped my head around all the symmetry crap) and doesn't get so pointy-headed that the beauty or - to use that favorite adjective of science types - 'elegance' of the whole mess is lost on the non-physicist. sitting on my balcony watching clouds roll by, a cluster of birds appearing from over the horizon, a receding storm (or, more likely, a few tranny hookers venturing up into the hills for a brief respite from cocksucking and cokesniffing) i imagine seeing all that can't be picked up by the naked eye: quantum fields everywhere, gravity pulling everything in the universe toward everything else, the tiny 'vibrations' in the higgs field of which carroll writes, trillions & trillions of particles batted about… and then you can do that power of ten thing and imagine stepping away from earth to solar system to galaxy to galaxy cluster, etc etc etc. ugh. such simple things as smallness and bigness really can put a serious existential damper on one's day… week… month… year… life… or, as per r. feynman, it can unlock within the physical world a child's toybox for grownups. your choice."
2,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Carroll tells us about the discovery of the Higgs boson and the importance of the underlying Higgs field to the Standard Model of particle physics. He describes the Large Hadron Collider, how it works, how it was used to find the Higgs boson and why this was so difficult. He imparts a bit of drama describing some of the key people involved and the excitement of the physics community at seeing an enormous amount of work come to fruition in 2012 at CERN. The Higgs had been theorized years earlier by its namesake Peter Higgs and others. Its discovery validated the Standard Model and bolstered physicists’ faith in this widely accepted picture of the laws of nature. In the Standard Model, the Higgs field imparts mass to particles (specifically charged fermions and W and Z bosons). The Higgs is not responsible for all mass, but if it were missing, electrons would lose mass and atoms could not form. Thus, if the Higgs field were to disappear, we and everything else would go poof. What really intrigued me about this book however, wasn’t the story of the discovery. It was Carroll’s lucid explanations of the Standard Model, the relationships between and properties of the particles, and particularly of quantum field theory. He explains how symmetry leads to force carrying bosons, how fields produce particles and how fields facilitate particles changing into and generating new particles. He does this without math, so it is a simplified version of this vision of reality, but one I could get my arms around. He starts with the basics, categorizing the particles and forces and steadily introduces more complicated concepts and ends throwing the most complicated topics in appendices such as an explanation of spin. I appreciated this graduated approach.Carroll explains wave particle duality straightforwardly. “According to quantum field theory absolutely everything is made of a field or combination of fields. What we call ‘particles’ are tiny vibrations in fields.” “The fields themselves aren’t ‘made of’ anything – fields are what the world is made of. We don’t know of any lower level of reality. Magnetism is carried by a field, as are gravity and the nuclear forces. Even what we call ‘matter’ – particles like electrons and protons – is really just a set of vibrating fields.” “Matter is really waves (quantum fields), but when we look at it carefully enough we see particles.” “How the world appears when we look at it is very different from how it really is.” Carroll proceeds throughout the book to describe interactions in terms of particles, yet he keeps us aware that underlying this image are vibrations in fields that induce vibrations in other fields. Visualizing this was more satisfying to me than trying to picture a particle just changing into a different one or ones. For example when a neutron decays becoming a proton after emitting an electron and antineutrino we might wonder where these new particles came from. Fermi in 1934 suggested the following way of thinking about it by applying field theory to fermions. Each of these particles come from their own fields, thus you can visualize the transfer of a vibration from the neutron field to the fields for the other particles even though you can’t see the vibrations, only the particles once the transfer is complete. This also explains virtual particles which appear to constantly be coming into and out of existence which are transient vibrations that can be a stepping stone from one particle to another. A Higgs boson can decay into two photons, but not directly, first it couples with a massive virtual particle (usually a top quark) producing the photons. Try thinking of this interaction in terms of vibrations in fields. This was a signature reaction the Higgs hunters were looking for and found at the LHC. The Higgs itself decays so quickly that it is never seen and is identified by its end products, in this case the two photons. The discussion above should give those interested the flavor of the book. I found Carroll’s descriptions of symmetry, symmetry breaking, and even spin helpful as were those of fields and virtual particles. Although there were, of course, many things I found difficult to understand if not incomprehensible. For example Carroll describes spin, “One of the consequences of quantum mechanics is that individual particles can also have ‘spin’ even though they are not really rotating around anything.” But for me the puzzles are part of the enjoyment of books like this. I’ve read two of Carroll’s other books: The Big Picture and From Eternity to Here . I loved them both. The Particle at the End of the Universe is more down to earth (if that is fair to say about science based on quantum mechanics) than the other two but every bit as enjoyable. "

Or more so.I have desperately wanted to put together a review that, in compartmentalized but orderly fashion, connects the various utterly absorbing stories which Carroll is telling in this highly-recommended book about the discovery of the elusive Higgs Boson on July 4th, 2012, at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland; a review wherein the politics, personalities, costs, designs, copious hard work, wonderful international unity and [mostly] comity in this laborious voyage of important particulate discovery was so juicily constructed that book stores would be nigh overwhelmed by the enthused rush of good readers hurtling through spacetime in an effort to get their mitts on a copy of this gem as quickly as proved feasible within a four-dimensional reality construct. Alas, I've blisters on my feet, a boil on my ass, a sebaceous cyst on my back, and internal blockage running near four days worth at the moment. That is, I can nae do that which I so desired—thus, as a lesser-of-two-evils option [the alternative being to shut the fuck up!] I'm going to transcribe the notes I took whilst devouring Carroll's word wizardry.

 Neutrons - 2 down/1 up charge, and Protons - 1 down/2 up charge. Hadrons, composed of the three quark colours, are always colourless.Fermion symmetries are broken by the Higgs Field, and the difference is 1 electrical unit.The Higgs Field permeates empty space and gives mass to the elementary particles. It is a blemish upon the otherwise beautiful symmetries of the Standard Model.Based on the electron volt scale, we can see that even the center of the sun is not hot enough to produce electrons, neutrons, or protons—it needs close to Big Bang temperatures to do that. It's why accelerators need more speed and power to see particles made invisible because of their heaviness.ABOUT THE CERN LARGE HADRON COLLIDERThe LEP (Large Electron Positron) Collider was so precise it could detect to within a percentile of an inch the moved effect of the moon's gravity upon the 17 mile long pipe. These instruments are very precise—and much more so than the Hadron Colliders. The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in Geneva is a spherical collider of clockwise and counterclockwise streamed protons—an enormous construct, its circumference runs to seventeen miles!The tube has superconductor magnets 100,000 times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, and are colder than space. The tubes are vacuum sealed and conduct proton fills up to 99.99996% the speed of light—and a pencil lead-sized beam of these protons has the kinetic energy of a moving train. The magnets are cooled by liquid helium; the protons are hydrogen atoms with the electrons stripped away by electric currents. The electric grid speeds the proton beam fills with every pass in separate clockwise and counterclockwise beam pipes. As of 2012, the LHC operates at 8 TeV (Terra electron volts); the goal is to reach 14 TeV, high enough to explore and detect further exotic particles of ultraheavy weight.ATLAS and CMS are the huge trap detectors for discovering particles emitted from the rapid decay of exotic particles like Higgs Bosons or Top Quarks. The particles emitted are 1 of the 6 quarks, leptons, or force-carrying bosons; and a collision of billions of particles might only result in 20 or 30 interactions! There is lots of empty space, even within proton beams.The vast majority of data collected by the LHC is instantly thrown away—it's too much data, and they have no choice: quantum mechanics orders that only a few events are not trivial, and so the LHC must produce huge numbers of them to get the new and the unexpected.The long red streaks below are muons detected in a particle collision with the LHC; the clumped middle streaks are electrons, hadrons, and photons. These muons may have been created from the decay of a Higgs bosonTHE HIGGS FIELD AND BOSONThe world is made out of fields—they are the lowest level of reality we know. Particles arise from field as vibrations, and symmetry gives rise to forces—the Higgs Field breaks symmetry to give us the variety of particles we have detected.High mass implies short wavelength—hence, the size of an atom is determined by the longer wavelength electron(s).Matter is really waves—quantum fields—but when we look at it carefully enough we see particles. While bosons can be stacked one on the other, Fermions cannot—each vibrational frequency of the latter's fields are either on or off. This means that each fermion particle has its own energy level, location, spin, etc, and no other fermion can be in exactly the same state. This is known as the Pauli Exclusion Principle.Matter is vibrations in a field, and we can thus think of the decay of a neutron into a proton, electron and anti-neutrino as a vibration altering from one form into that of three different ones—as long as it obeys the conservation laws of energy, electric charge, and quark/lepton count. The basic rule is that larger particles prefer to decay into smaller ones, as long as those conservation laws can be strictly obeyed.The Higgs Field is literally all around us, for it is non-zero in empty space. Its field permeates our reality, and its influence on our particles is what gives them their unique properties. It fills space, breaks symmetries, and gives mass and individuality to all other particles—without it, our universe would be wholly unrecognizable and unlivable.The Higgs Field can be perceived as an inverted pendulum whose rest mass—whether right or left—is of 245 GeV (Giga electron volts), and so it costs energy to be moved upright to zero [an analogy remarkably similar to the procedure of male erection, sans subjective and/or non-subjective friction]. An ordinary field is the mirror opposite, a hanging pendulum which rests at zero and requires energy to be moved to a horizontal position—whether right or left—hence, it seeks the zero point, whereas the Higgs Field desires to lay at rest in either direction all primed with non-zero energy.If the Higgs Field didn't exist, electrons would have little to no mass—and because, in Quantum Mechanics, the lower energy/mass a particle has, the longer the wavelength, atoms would be huge—at certain energy amounts, galactically so—and complex molecules could not form. There would also be no broken symmetries of the charged leptons—Tau/Muon/Electron—nor the three charged quarks—2/3 positive and 1/3 negative—that is, you could replace any one with the other, because they would all have the same mass and charge. Particle symmetries—valence for leptons, flavor for quarks—mean you can rotate one for another and see no difference. It is the Higgs Field that breaks these symmetries and allows for the variation among these particles.Physics particle symmetries are transitional invariance, rotational invariance, motional invariance—gauge, or local symmetries that allow bosons to form from the connexion fields that give vim to the Four Forces of Nature. All of the bosons are massless and move at the speed of light, except for those of the Weak Force: the W+- and Z bosons are given mass and charge by consuming three of the four Higgs Bosons that would exist if the Higgs Field didn't break symmetries in the Weak Force. Because the pendulum of the Higgs Field can rest at either right or left—and it requires massive, universe-sized energy to lift it to a zero-state of being upright—it breaks the left/right symmetries of quarks and lepton pairs—top/bottom, charm/strange, up/down and the three electron/muon/tau and neutrino pairs—so that only one of the two has symmetry, while the other doesn't; otherwise they would all be the same size and perfectly symmetrical. This accounts for the W+- and Z boson's strange number and mass, and that protons and neutrons have a near symmetry but not a perfect one. Gauge symmetries are broken and left/right distinctions made in the Weak Force through the existence of the Higgs Field.HOW THE HIGGS BOSON WAS DETECTEDHiggs bosons are difficult to detect because most of the time they decay into quark/antiquark pairs which, as Hadron sprays, are extremely difficult to isolate from general proton smashing results. What physicists look for are the rare cases when the Higgs Boson decays into one of the following:
i: W+ and W- bosons --> muons/electrons and neutrinos or antimuons/positrons and antineutrinos.ii: 2 Z bosons --> electron/muon or positron/antimuon.iii: 2 charged particles --> photons.Sigmas are numeric intervals indicating deviations from the statistical mean, usually as a bell curve of probability as based upon the null hypothesis [the expected results]. Sigma of 3+, and preferably of 5 sigma, are demanded for a discovery of the Higgs Boson from a very wide spread of data.HISTORY OF THE GLOBAL & GAUGE THEORIES THAT LED TO HIGGS FIELD/BOSONGauge symmetries—local ones that necessarily come with connexion fields that give rise to force, have strict rules of symmetry: massless bosons that move at light speed and, hence, whose fields spread over infinite distances. This seems obvious for gravity and electromagnetism, but the nuclear forces are different. The Strong Force has massless gluons hidden inside of hadrons, while the W+- and Z bosons of the Weak Force are given mass by spontaneous symmetry breaking. The latter bosons, together with the Higgs, were set on the trail of discovery when physicists probed the qualities of global symmetries—that is, transformations must be carried out uniformly everywhere at the same time—which produced mathematical impossibilities; but this process pointed to local symmetries—in which transformations can be carried out separately at every location—wherein the answer was to be found.BCS and Landau-Ginzberg theories of superconductivity postulated that the electric force moves unimpeded through such as the carrier pairs of electrons, which 1/2 spin combines to 1 and act as a massed photon. The presence of a bosonic field—unknown—allows a photon to have mass and move unimpeded past other atoms and electrons. This was determined to require a field of non-zero value which spontaneously broke the symmetry of the electromagnetic field and its requirement that all bosons be massless. Physicists developed this as a theory: global symmetries are broken by a field that otherwise would produce N number of scalar [non-spin] bosons. With the boson symmetry in place, all but 1 of this N number become massless, and the one remaining becomes massive.Yang-Mills gauge bosons and Nambu-Goldstone global bosons are posited massless particles—Anderson proposed that you start with the massless force-carrying particles and that those N number of bosons arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking combine into ONE massive boson—but this requires a field across all of non-zero space, which General Relativity tells us must have an enormous energy which would be detectable by our instruments in empty space.Higgs was one of three groups of physicists who tackled this problem; but he was first of them to explore the details of how we start with N number of equal mass scalar bosons and N1 massless gauge bosons before the local symmetry breaking—afterwards the scalar bosons are gobbled up by massive gauge bosons—the W+- and Z of the Weak Force found in the 1980s—and one massive scalar boson, which is the Higgs Boson, as well as another gauge boson which starts and remains massless as a photon.Higgs' work developed from Y-M, N-G, and Anderson, and was near simultaneously developed by Englert-Brout. The third group of physicists, Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble, approached the problem from a Quantum Mechanical point-of-view, manually setting the scalar boson to zero mass to achieve their results. All three had similar ideas and solutions to symmetry breaking at gauge levels.Carroll provides a really captivating history of the historic 20th century attempts to unite the Electromagnetic and Weak Forces via neutron decay into massless neutral gauge bosons—the photon—and various produced massive weak bosons—W+- and Z—which had not been detected yet; however, soon theorists would run into infinity problems, via the hand-tooling required to break the symmetries, particularly the Electromagnetic—together with purity problems, the favoring of left-handed particles over right-handed ones which the Electromagnetic force explicitly does not do.Higgs | Englert-Brout | Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: discovered the symmetry-breaking gauge process.Glashow-Weinberg-Salam: confirmed the Electroweak unification via the Higgs mechanism.Hooft: mathematically proved spontaneously-broken gauge symmetries are renormalizable.WHERE THE HIGGS DISCOVERY MAY TAKE USDark Matter density in vacuum space:Can the Higgs Boson detection prove helpful to other problems like that of Dark Matter—as the latter should only feel Gravity and the Weak Force, it may interact with the Higgs Field, decaying via Higgs Bosons into Standard Model particles, or even perhaps into the Higgs Boson itself. WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) quantity predictions align nicely to those for Dark Matter itself—and it may prove that the discovery of the Higgs Boson opens the long sought for link between our world and what mysteriously comprises the vast majority of matter in our universe.A pair of significant problem for physicists are that Higgs Field energy is much lower than estimates say it should be, while vacuum energy—better known as Dark Energy—is 10^120 times less than it should be across the measured universe—and this last is truly a stunning amount of disparity between theory and current detection. Will stronger colliders with higher energies allow us to detect the exotic particles whose decay properties will guide us towards solving these vast and disturbing discrepancies?Supersymmetrical Particle Chart:Supersymmetry: if supersymmetry exists, then the LHC will be looking for 5 Higgs Bosons, of which the one detected on July 4th, 2012, would have to be the smallest in size. Supersymmetry is wacky business, but it nicely accounts for the Hierarchy Problem and could potentially solve the Dark Matter energy incongruency, with neutralinos—no, not the popular children's cereal!—serving as the stable mass particle; if this proves to be the case, then physics will finally have effected a unification of Particle Physics with Cosmology; very heady business, that.WHY THIS BOOK GAVE ME SCIENTIFIC WOODA truly wonderful and enlightening book, wherein Carroll shows himself a science writer of the first rank: never overwhelming the reader with the complex mathematics and conceptualizations required to make sufficient sense of the physics being described, while also refusing to buckle to the pressure to limn everything by means of lame television analogies. He's also possessed of a wickedly dry sense of humour, something he wields as effective punctuation to release stored tension from stretches where things are getting slippery. Furthermore, there are three excellent appendixes at the back in which the reader who desires a more thorough and sound schooling in the scientific details of the processes previously brought to light are set forth. The discovery of the Higgs Boson was the end point of a remarkable amount and progression of international cooperation and scientific history—another example, and one of the best I've yet encountered, of the supremely impressive human capacity for puzzling through the veils of reality's multi-faceted puzzles to try and determine how this whole insanely-interrelated business of the cosmos came to be. It's a tale wholly uplifting in its themes, its results, the dreams being pursued, and the wonderful array of human beings involved in its coming to fruition. After recent immersion within the sordid details of human history via the fictive and historical word, it proved a genuine pleasure to lose myself in the pages of this kind of edifying and fortifying material. The highest recommendation for any and all."
4,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist, and he has written an engaging book about the history of the search for the Higgs boson. This is a fundamental particle that cannot be observed directly, but can only be surmised by indirect evidence in a high-energy accelerator. Its existence was proved by two experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN, on the border between Switzerland and France.Sean Carroll tells the story of the LHC wonderfully. He tells the story of the predecessors to LHC, the inception of the machine and the efforts of Lyn Evans in building it. Color illustrations give the reader a clue of the complexity and immensity of the largest machine ever built by man. Over six thousand scientists worked together on the two experiments, proving the existence of the Higgs boson. This is big science at its biggest. While there is still room in physics for small-scale experiments, high-energy particle physics demands enormous machines, and large-scale international efforts.The book also describes the context of the Higgs boson in particle physics. Several chapters go into considerable detail about the hierarchy of particles, their characteristics and interactions. It gets complicated--very complicated. To tell the truth, there are several places where I got lost. I re-read those sections, but I still didn't ""get it"". There are three appendices that explain the physics in more detail (with no equations at all). In the first appendix, I was understanding the descriptions of particle spin, degrees of freedom and symmetry-breaking. But the last step in which Carroll jumps to the characteristic of mass being imparted by the Higgs field simply left me behind. I think that something crucial is missing from Carroll's descriptions here.On the whole, Carroll's descriptions of the physics are excellent. He engages in lots of metaphors from everyday experiences to give some concreteness to the very abstract notions. For example, the inverted pendulum gives a good, intuitive approach to the level of energy of a Higgs boson. Carroll also uses some apt--and fun--metaphors. For example, he describes how Angelina Jolie walking across a party room full of people will be slowed down by fans wanting an autograph. She ""breaks the symmetry"" because if Carroll were to walk across the same room, he would not be approached and would cross the room unhindered. Carroll also writes about how dropping Mentos into bottles of Diet Coke will have the same result when you are sitting still, as when you are in a train going 100 miles per hour.This book was written before the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded in 2013. So, Carroll devotes a chapter to the stories of all of the contenders. One of the sections describes the landmark work by Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble. This section is particularly interesting to me, as Gerald Guralnik is the father of a colleague of mine. As a result, I have heard quite a lot about this topic, and while it turns out that Guralnik did not receive the Nobel Prize, he was a very strong contender.I enjoyed reading the historical aspects of the theory and experiments. But, the descriptions of the theory itself--the so-called ""Standard Model"" of quantum physics--go into such a level of detail that I got lost. Carroll himself points out at one point that without going through the equations, you just have to ""trust him"" on certain points. Therein lies a gap, and I couldn't quite make the leap. "

We have a conjured up standard model proves to be correct, and completes along with the finding of Higgs boson. It is an appreciable work from Carroll, that does well to instigate curiosity in particle physics. Details journey how CERN came got build and along the works done in Fermilab are good to know. Probably the Ligos' findings got late before the release of book, so now we know gravitational waves do exist too. Bringing particle physics to public would be toughest endeavor, but Sean does some good justice. Yet the quest is not done, elusive question of why everything is here takes another gear. Until CERN gets another upgrade for high energy particle collision we may to wait for while turn the next page. Journey is set for Gravitons, Dark matter , Dark Energy and so on.

There’s a few more physics books on my list to get to, too, though I might give them a bit of a rest right now. The problem with me reviewing all of these is, of course, that I wouldn’t know a Higgs boson if it came up and introduced itself. All I can say is how well I understand what the writers offer. In Sean Carroll’s case, I felt my understanding was pretty good: the chapters are relatively short and build slowly toward a sketch of the full picture, and he doesn’t use technical terms that’re too hard to understand or anything like that.And while I don’t think I could explain much of this to anyone (except maybe the basic ideas about symmetry breaking, and fields), at least I’ve retained some of the information, which has always been my problem when it comes to math and physics. (That and my tendency to go, “Yeah, I can parrot back to you what you want me to say, but why is it that way?” until my teachers resorted to “because I said so!”)Of course, this was published over a year ago now, so it’s probably out of date in new and exciting ways. I’m content to trail behind the leading edge, I think… One of my big hopes about my Open University course is that I’ll start to understand physics a bit more, but even then I think string theory and its ilk will be beyond me."

This one is less accessible-more nuts and bolts than Hawking's style, with less scientific philosophy and creative metaphor to help the lay reader to really understand. Also: the book deals with one of the most interesting machines built in human history, but wastes most of the photo sections on pictures of physicists no one will ever meet.

Whilst I learnt a lot from this book there was still much that I couldn't fully comprehend. Nevertheless, I doubt that any other author could explain the concept of the Higgs field and Higgs boson in a better way than Sean Carroll. He has a talent for putting across difficult ideas in a way that non-specialists can follow. Yet even he, at least as far as I was concerned, couldn't fully gets the Higgs concept across to the extent that I could fully understand it. But the despite the challenges presented by the book, I still very much enjoyed reading it and I'm undoubtedly better informed than I was before I started, especially on the concept of symmetry which is so important for an understanding of the Higgs theory."

There doesn't seem to be a quick easy way to describe what the Higgs boson is, what it does and why we should care. Carroll carefully and methodically takes the reader through each of these and I, a person with no physics background, am actually learning and understanding about particle physics (at a layperson level, obviously). I think I need to read it a second time to really solidify my understanding, but I've learned tons on just this first reading. Not finished yet, but even if the few remaining pages and appendices completely suck (which i can't imagine really) this book is still a must-read for anyone curious about the Higgs hoopla and what the heck the LHC does.

Our money wasn't wasted, and we will continue to learn from the data gathered at the LHC for a long time. The author takes a look at the pioneering work that went into the building of the accelerators and the scientific work of those leading up to this finding and what it will mean for us in the long term. I read this back to back with Lee Smolins work ""the trouble with physic"". I find this an interesting companion to this work and highly advise to read the two of them together, give it a go. Its an amazing human achievement and deserves a closer look at how we got here and what we plan on doing with the information we find in the future. The author does this fairly well, and the book was enjoyable. "
13,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,"Sean Carroll effectively communicates his knowledge and enthusiasm about the search and discovery of the Higgs boson. After reading this book a person can explain the significance of the discovery and share in the excitement of the collective accomplishment. In addition, the exposure to Carroll's scientific mind, equal parts skepticism and wonder, is time well spent. Carroll is willing to speak in declarative sentences, not a lot of hedging here. ""Matter is really waves (quantum fields and parentheses), but when we look at it carefully enough we see particles.""Those like me looking for an engaging and authoritative explanation of humanity's greatest scientific experiment, both in scope and dollars, they will not be disappointed in this book."

I keep reading science books in hopes of eventually understanding this stuff. It is absolutely fascinating! I do wish I had more of a brain for understanding science! It is really some of the most fascinating things in the world! In any case, on to this specific title.From comments in the book I am positive that the obvious allusion in the title is there on purpose. He didn't specifically comment on that part of the title, just noting that he is aware that Higgs Bosons are not at the edge of any world and admitting that the title isn't exactly modest! This was in reference to another title, the God Particle (the authors of that book noted in a subsequent edition that they chose ""God Particle"" because the publishers wouldn't let them call it the Goddamn Particle which they contend would have been much more accurate!) Carroll writes in a very entertaining style and clearly is fascinated by this field. This is not his specific field, he dabbles more in cosmology and gravitation, which probably explains some of what wandered into the text on gravitation and cosmology. For once, I feel I actually understood a lot of what was explained in this book. Usually I find physics to be completely bewildering but I really understood at least a few concepts this time so I'm thrilled. One of the things that Carroll is very emphatic about is that it isn't really the Higgs Boson that is of fascination, it is the Higgs FIELD that is fascinating. The Boson (a force carrying particle) is more or less a wrinkle in the Higgs Field. The Higgs Field is compared to molasses: it more or less grabs onto all the particles from other fields and slows them down, giving them mass in the process. So without the Higgs Field none of us or the world would exist. There would just be particles wandering around in straight lines. I did understand a lot of the history, particularly of the LHC, Large Hadron Collider, in Switzerland. Carroll also admitted point blank that the basic reason for such studies is that it is ""freaking awesome""! He admits cheerfully that he doesn't know if any tangible benefits will appear from this science, although he pointed out that the WWW came as a result of all these enormous number of physicists needing to be able to keep in touch with each other's work. He pretty much stated that if you can get any physicist to admit the truth, most would say that the awesomeness is why they got into the field to begin with and that they all live for that sense of awe and wonder of something new in the field. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn why the Higgs Boson has been in the news the last few years."

Key to understanding why mass exists and how atoms are possible, this elusive particle has finally been found after $9 billion, decades of effort, and the work of over six thousand researchers at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. In 2012, the history of a quest that began with the atomists of ancient Greece over 2,500 years ago reached a dramatic and historic turning point.Caltech physicist and acclaimed writer Sean Carroll takes readers behind the scenes of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, to meet the theorists, engineers, and experimentalists, illuminate this landmark event, and explain the science of the Higgs boson, infamously known as ""the God Particle.""What is so special about the Higgs boson? As Sean Carroll eloquently explains, without it we wouldn't understand how elementary particles could have mass at all. With it, we have found the final piece of the puzzle of ordinary matter: the atoms and forces underlying everything from DNA to global warming. Now a doorway is opening into the extraordinary: the mind-boggling world of dark matter and beyond. The Higgs discovery represents a triumph of the human passion for discovery, and the dawn of a new era in our exploration of the cosmos.The Particle at the End of the Universe not only explains the importance of the Higgs boson but also the Large Hadron Collider -- the largest machine ever built. Such a project could not have happened without a certain amount of conniving, dealing, and occasional skullduggery -- and Sean Carroll explores it all.

This book is especially good at introducing the experiments being run to find the Higgs (and other particles.) Also, this author had a lighter touch with the political side of funding Big Science than some others I've recently read, which ended up being more convincing to me. It's a nice complement to Lisa Randall's books and I was glad to find it did not repeat much of them. It might be a better place to start than some of the other popular treatments of this subject."
18,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,4,"I find cosmology a fascinating topic and got some exposure to particle physics during my cosmology-related prior reads. Articles caught my attention in 2012 about the breakthrough in the quest for the Higgs boson - also called in sensational newspapers the ‘God Particle’ but I did not get to the bottom of the story then. Now decided to pick up this book to gain a better understanding of this intriguing Higgs field / boson phenomenon. All themes in the book relate to particle physics in a way but the breadth and deepness of science vary from chapter to chapter. Carroll thoroughly writes about the gripping story of constructing the Large Hadron Collider in France and Switzerland, the awe-inspiring collaboration of physicists from each corner of the world and also about the delicate dynamics between science and politics. To balance out such lightness in tone some other chapters are massively loaded with challenging-to-follow physical theorems where a layman person like me had better advance slowly and cautiously. I have learnt a lot from the book but also realized in the process that reading much about the Higgs boson makes me feel as if I got a pretty good buzz on... So, what’s the special trick of the Higgs field?Elementary particles come in two types. Fermions, e.g. quarks and electrons, do take up place and serve as the basic building blocks for solid objects such as the human body, TV sets or planets. On the other hand, bosons do not take up any place but do carry forces creating fields. Particle physicists ordered all these elementary particles into a beautifully organized Standard Model. We well know four kinds of forces: 1) gravity, with the associated boson called graviton, 2) electromagnetism, with the corresponding boson called photon, 3) the strong nuclear force responsible for holding together the quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons within the nucleus, thanks to the force-carrying boson called gluon, and 4) the weak nuclear force with its own bosons creatively named as Z+, Z- and W. And here comes into the picture a fifth, mysterious and unique force which is the Higgs force with its own boson unsurprisingly called the Higgs boson. The Higgs field is all around us and, unlike any other field, it has a nonzero value in completely empty space too. The Higgs field influences on all other elementary particles and gives them their mass. The more the Higgs field interacts with a certain particle, the more mass it has. Massless particles such as photons within the sunlight are massless because they do not interact with the Higgs field at all. Physicists have been theorizing about the existence of the Higgs field since the 1960s but a theory remains a theory until its validity gets tested and proved through experiments. The Higgs boson turned out to be a stubbornly elusive particle. It’s rather heavy so it speedily decays into other particles. That created a huge technological and scientific challenge for the physicist on the hunt for it. They had to wait for the construction of the 9-billion-dollar Large Hadron Collider to be able to get hold of the Higgs boson for good in 2012. Are there any immediately applicable technological applications out of having discovered the Higgs boson? No, nothing at all. However, as Carroll plausibly explains that’s not the point and such an outcome is not surprising either. When Faraday was asked about the usefulness of the new-fangled electricity or Hertz about his radio-wave-detecting device both of them gave a hesitant ‘I don’t know’ response. When Hertz was prodded further to suggest some practical application, he added, “Nothing, I guess.”. Discoveries reached through basic research do build into practical applications at a later stage. Or they don’t but they greatly help humanity gain a deeper understanding of the nature and the universe we are living in. Expectations from particle physicists are the very same with regards to the Higgs field. It may open new inroads into a more thorough understanding of dark matter, supersymmetry, extra dimensions. In case you still don't believe that particle physics (not to mention the physicists) can be entertaining, please do yourself a favor and watch the ‘Large Hadron Rap’ on YouTube. Enjoy!"

Sean does a fantastic job of explaining the higgs, but you can't understand the higgs without first understanding quantum field theory and that's where this book shines. the last chapter he muses on the human experience with my all time favorite question, ""we are matter contemplating itself, how did that happen?"" Over all an excellent quantum mechanics book with the higgs as a bonus. Sean carroll is one of a kind."

21,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,4,"(Reviewers Note: 3 stars for me personally because it felt more like a recap of things I've already learned, but when I think about it as a recommendation for a different type of audience, the less scientifically initiated, the rating goes up significantly to 4-5 stars. If the world of particle physics is completely new to you, this is a 5-star book and the place you should FIRST read about the Higgs. If you've got some physics training and are a blog-junky, read for the history of the project, which is excellent, and the where do we go from here parts.)Instinct told me it was too early for a book on the discovery of the Higgs and its implications for the future of physics, but i threw caution to the wind because said book was written by my favorite living physicist. (From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time is pretty much my absolute favorite popular physics book of all time. If you're interested in fundamental questions and cosmology you can hardly do better.) The fact of the matter is we don't even know if what we've found at the LHC is THE Higgs that completes the Standard Model or if it's a sign of something new and different. Sure, it meshes well with a powerful theory that has so far worked remarkably well when we've tested other more easily accessible aspects, but more experimentation has to be done to be sure-sure. To be absolutely fair to Dr. Carroll, he is completely forthright about the extent of our knowledge at this point and his approach is one of measured scientific reserve and optimism. He also makes an extremely good point about how difficult it is to convey how important the discovery is: the level of physics involved in discussing the implications of the discovery of the Higgs boson is such that it makes popular treatment incredibly challenging. Its certainly not impossible, and Carroll makes a noble effort, but there are certain chapters (like the on spontaneous symmetry breaking) that i imagine would be pure slogging for the uninitiated. The author even gives his blessing for the faint of heart to skip ahead on the more technical chapters to the more readily accessible parts of what it all means. In general the structure and layout of the book is logical, if sometimes a bit repetitive (but then again some points definitely bear repeating). If the intended audience is primarily those who are complete laymen when it comes to the scientific and experimental process and modern physics, which I assume to be the case since most there are an awful lot of ""mortals"" wondering what this is all about since it's been plastered all over the news for the past 6 months, then it succeeds quite remarkably. Carroll is a great science communicator, on par in my opinion with Sagan and deGrasse Tyson. As I mentioned earlier, he has his work cut out for him. Explicating even the general principles of quantum field theory requires a paradigm shift from the perspective of an audience whose everyday experience teaches them that stuff is tangible, real and discreet rather than the view that matter and energy are composed of fields whose vibrations we merely perceive to be so. Nevertheless, here's what to expect:1. What's the point of particle physics and why we care about the Higgs so much?2. How do we go about finding particles like the Higgs? (How do accelerators work?)3. A history of the LHC and accelerator discoveries.4. A history and introduction to quantum field theory.5. The discovery.6. What comes next?Of these topics, my scientifically inclined mind was most eager for #6, which was disappointingly short. Once again, this is no fault of Carroll's. We don't know really where this is going to lead. Can we use the Higgs to access the other 96% of our universe's ""missing"" mass? Can we use it to validate supersymmetry? Hopefully. We don't know....""only more experiments will tell us...."" Which is pretty much what any reasonable person would expect as an answer at this short a juncture from the discovery itself. I think the concluding remarks that seemed to indicate that the discovery of the Higgs is this generation's equivalent of the moon landing in terms of its impact on and ability to inspire children to pursue careers in science is highly optimistic. Sure, a key component of the survival of big science is the inspiration and wonder it generates, but you have to wonder if we've reached such an esoteric level that most people (whose tax dollars fund these projects) can simply no longer connect with the discovery. Sure there was a lot of media attention, but it also died off rather quickly and was (probably by necessity) more than a little superficial. In fact, it probably generated more confusion and misperceptions than conveying the true gravity of the discovery and was then just as easily forgotten. You have to wonder if the next generation of particle physicists, the five to seven year olds who still love science connected with the news at all. It's definitely not the same as gathering your family around the television to watch a man bounce around on the surface of another celestial body. The visual imagery is more visceral, the technical achievement more readily apparent to anybody who goes outside and looks up and for kids at least, it just seems a heck of a lot cooler. Not to say that the LHC is not cool - it most definitely is. Pictures of it are also really impressive, but explaining what it does and how it does it to a child is a much more difficult task than taking them outside on a clear night and pointing at the sky and saying ""We're going to build rockets that go there.""And don't get me wrong, it needs to be made inspiring! We need to convey just how important these types of experiments are and Carroll has made a heroic effort in that direction as a first step. His accounting is honest, realistic and also imbued with that sense of awesomeness that we science geeks tend to feel when thinking about the universe - and it comes through in remarkably straightforward terms. One would hope his exhortation to his colleagues to be better communicators is taken with all due seriousness. We are in an age of ""big science."" The problems we face more and more often require huge investments of time and money, which is more and more difficult to sell when the gains are in the realm of pure reason to an audience that primarily wants ""stuff"" for their investments. Carroll puts it nicely when he says the low lying fruit has been picked clean in physics. This needs to be communicated to people with the same gravity as the excitement we typically try to convey when first selling projects for the next generation of physics. Again, this book does that extremely well.Again, if you haven't been keeping up and have no idea what a boson is or think that dark matter and antimatter are purely the realm of science fiction, this is a great starting point for you. In fact, its probably the best game in town. (Be warned there's some heavy science necessary if you want to understand it more fully, but to see why it's important, you won't.) If you're a science blog junkie, then a lot of this stuff is old hat to you and the more forward looking sections may leave you hanging a bit. Also, if you get the chance to attend any of Carroll's talks, do yourself a favor and get a ticket. The man is hilarious, knowledgeable and able to answer even complicated questions in ways that everyone can understand. Oh, and if you're reading Dr. Carroll, maybe I'm crazy, but I think your artist forget his right hand rule when constructing the image on page 57. 8)"
22,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16624009-mengsen-zhang,4,"I have quite mixed feelings about this book. I would give 5 five stars for science communication, and 3 stars for too little physics to my taste. Re: science communication, one can feel that tremendous efforts were made to introduce complicated physical concepts to a general audience in intuitive ways. Most admirably, the author managed to convey, more accurately than a lot of scientists, what it means scientifically to ""discover"" Higgs Boson (or anything for that matter) -- what kind of theoretical labor and accuracy is required to predict an empirically verifiable distribution of particular events, how enormous an project it is to experimentally test such theoretical predictions, how important are the human factors. I especially appreciate that figures comparing theoretical predictions and empirical measurements of two photon events are provided. It gives the readers the liberty to judge on their own of the certainty of the scientific conclusions implied. Re: physics, a lot of analogies were used explain the working of Higgs and the Standard Model, which works very well locally but lacks coherence globally in explaining the relevant physical theories. Occasionally, difficult concepts were dished out without in-depth explanation as if it was very straight forward. For example, it was said that local symmetry gave rise to connection fields which in turn gave rise to forces of nature. But why? I cannot imagine how I would feel about this had I not taken any intro class on relevant math. Symmetries were invoked repeatedly through out the book, not accompanied with exposition of which symmetry and how. Maybe I'm just asking too much... I would still recommend it as a very nice science book. "
23,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"The possible discovery of the Higgs boson has prompted a flurry of books – in part because it’s significant (and because the Large Hadron Collider is a sexy bit of kit) and in part because the whole business of the Higgs field and its importance for the mass of particles is one of the most obscure and unlikely bits of physics in the current canon.I have really mixed feelings about this entry in the genre from physicist Sean Carroll. It’s not because his book is too difficult to understand – it’s almost because it’s too easy. Generally speaking, there are three levels of good popular science. There’s TV news popular science, which cuts a lot of corners to make things totally simplistic, but manages to get the message across quickly. There’s the kind of book a good popular science writer will produce – highly approachable and readable, giving a lot more depth than the TV news and the best way to actually get an understanding of what’s going on for most of us, but still cutting some scientific corners. And there’s the kind of book a good scientist will write, which will probably go over your head the first time you read it, but if you persevere will give you the best illusion of knowing what the real science is about and getting some feel for the world of the scientist.In his previous book From Eternity to Here, like Cox & Forshaw’s Why Does E=mc2, Carroll didn’t pull the punches. Much of the text was readable, but it may well have taken several attempts to get it to sink in. It was the perfect popular science book by an academic. Parts of this one, unfortunately verge on TV science. Some of it is so fluffy and approachable that it almost disappears into meaninglessness.Luckily, this isn’t true of all the book. The early parts are worse. Oddly, he gets significantly better when talking about the building of the Large Hadron Collider than he does in his first attempts on the physics. And it is worth persevering as Carroll improves with his approach further in (best of all are a few appendices where he goes into more detail and we see the old, mind-bending Carroll emerging).Some specific issues I had: it was really irritating that Carroll uses units like degrees Fahrenheit and miles rather than scientific (or European) units throughout. This is real poor TV science stuff. A lot of his science is what I’d call ‘plonking’ he states it as if it is absolute truth, not the current best theory. So, for instance, he speaks of dark matter as if it were certain fact (nary a mention of the rival MOND theory). And he says at one point ‘The world is really made out of fields. Sometimes the stuff of the universe looks like particles… but deep down it’s really fields.’I have two problems with this. One is that one of my absolute heroes was Richard Feynman and he said of light ‘I want to emphasize that light does come in this form – particles.’ If particles are good enough for Feynman, they’re good enough for me. Secondly I think that what Carroll should be saying is ‘fields are the model that work best to describe what’s out there.’ In the end it’s a human devised model of something we can only inspect extremely indirectly. It is almost bound to be wrong – it’s just better than anything else we have at doing the job. (Yet.)Perhaps the worst problem is the way he oversimplifies. Oddly this is a classic problem when a scientist is writing popular science (and why a good science writer is usually better) because he doesn’t know what the lay reader finds puzzling, so doesn’t bother to explain. His explanation of the application of symmetry to physics simply doesn’t fill in enough of the gaps. He says, for instance, that a mentos and diet coke experiment is symmetrical in all sorts of ways – you can point it in any direction, or translate it to any position and it works the same. Clearly this isn’t true. It wouldn’t work the same if the bottle was upside down, pointing straight at the ground, nor would it be the same if you translated it under the sea or into space. It’s a classic case of handwaving generalisation, missing out all the provisos and so making the explanation fail.It’s certainly not a bad book – but I did prefer its rivals on a couple of counts. For a better heavy duty attempt at the physics, Frank Close’s The Infinity Puzzle wins (though that definitely is a ‘several reads to get it’ book). And for the best overall description of the search for the Higgs, combined with the most approachable but informative information on the Higgs field and the whole standard model of particle physics I’d recommend Higgs by Jim Baggott. But Sean Carroll’s book still did have a lot going for it and is still well worth considering.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
24,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"I love physics and general science. My problem is that I suck at math (English major) and even general science books dealing with quantum physics and particle physics can get super ... number-y.This book was written not long after the Large Hadron Collider in Bern, Switzerland, announced that they had finally seen the evidence of the Higgs Boson particle that had been predicted 50 years earlier. It is the most plain-English explanation of the so-called ""God particle"" I've read to date. Sean Carroll has a teacher's touch, using easy-to-understand metaphors and analogies to explain just what's happening at what, so far, are the smallest things we can conceive of. Carroll starts out with a basic description of the Large Hadron Collider, mostly funded by nations within the European Union with a $2-billion contribution from the US when Congress failed to fund a similar program here. He talks about the challenges in constructing what is mostly a donut-shaped tube with immense magnets cooled to a temperature lower than what you'd find in deep space. That tube is used to speed particles to just a few hundredths of a percentage point short of the speed of light, allowing them to collide and break into smaller particles. The challenge is then to capture the image of little particles that can disappear in less than a trillionth of a second, and then to do a statistical analysis of thousands of these collisions to determine with certainty what they're seeing. (I'm trying to distill this to the bare minimum of what a whole book describes in brilliant detail.)The author also gives a basic history of the physics discoveries leading to finding this particle, which is evidence of a field that exists throughout the universe. He discusses the reason it ended up being called ""God particle"", which made an easy hook for journalists to build interest in stories on the project. Best of all, perhaps, is he talks about how science develops an idea, tests it, and either dismisses it or begins to develop better and better evidence. Lastly he is clear that this is not the end of physics. There are still things we don't understand, other particles to discover (a new one was announced just a week before this is being written), and further challenges for science.So along with being a very readable book on a complicated subject it is also an explanation and celebration of science and scientific curiosity in general. Were I richer, and convinced they could read, I'd send a copy to every member of Congress. While the scientific community is better at overlooking political map boundaries than most of us it still seems embarrassing that we're ceding a competitive scientific spirit to the rest of the world. "
25,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,3,"Sean Carroll writes an incredibly engaging book primarily on the Higgs Boson which was indirectly discovered in 2012 a very short time before this book first came out. While I preferred his work on cosmology (From Eternity to Here), I do believe he has made this work on particle physics as interesting to the man on the street as possible. He does a great job seasoning his work with practical analogies that make abstract ideas more concrete. I also like his ability to humanize many of his colleagues by sharing personal notes or highlights from their lives. For me, this book fails on two points. First, I felt like he was saying a bit too often ""just trust me on this"". I do understand why he does it. We are talking about incredibly abstract concepts that are very difficult to explain without giving a fuller explanation that most cause most people's eyes to glaze over. I get it. What I would rather have seen would be a more detailed appendix and instead of saying ""trust me"" he could say ""for those interested, you can see the reasoning behind this in Appendix A (or B or C or...)The second point where I felt this book fails was his defense of things like the LHC. Multiple billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on the creation of things like the Large Hadron Collider and Carroll's defense of this seems to boil down to 1) Science is good, and 2) Even though there is no practical application to most of what we are learning in this field now, maybe someday... ""just trust me""Yes, science is good. I strongly believe we should be spending much more on both scientific research and education. But there are other fields right now that have a much better cost to application ratio which should receive a larger piece of the pie at this point in time. At least that is my humble opinion. So to sum up, this is a great book on the Higgs Boson in particular and particle physics in general. This is not nearly so good of a defense for the exorbitant cost (which seems to grow exponentially with each new step of discovery)."
26,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21788173-daniel-shawen,5,"An excellent read. It has details about the LHC and the discovery of the Higgs boson that cannot be found anywhere else.Sean is the one whom, after the discovery quipped: ""We can't call it the god particle anymore because it actually exists.""Indeed it does. The Higgs is the first scalar particle ever discovered and 'completes' the so-called Standard Model. The Standard Model is a mathematical construct that purports through various techniques to relate the strong nuclear force and the electroweak, although EM is also in there somewhere.A few of the things the book doesn't tell you about the Higgs field/mechanism/boson, which it probably should:Each time a Higgs interacts with a particle, imparting inertial mass, it changes the handedness of that particle. These particles include quarks, antiquarks, electrons, and neutrinos. In the case of the neutrino, a specialized mechanism is called the ""SeeSaw"", which is under hot scrutiny right now as the best thing to investigate in order to extend and refine the Standard Model. Electrons interact VERY strongly with the Higgs boson; even more strongly, it seems, than it interacts with photons, and that's saying quite a lot.Although it doesn't have the right spin (2) all by itself, many theoreticians are actively engaged in determining whether an interaction of the Higgs field with another one might be a candidate for explaining things like gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. This book is a solid introduction of what is certain to be the most important scientific discovery of the 21st, and perhaps any other century. Explanations of the nature of time itself, the dilation of it near intense gravitational fields, the reason that General Relativity is a success and even the reason why the speed of light is the maximum speed of any matter that interacts with the Higgs field are all possible now, and that's just for starters."
27,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509211-jim,5,"My first thought after reading this book is if any person that is, has, or will be is interested in life they must read this. Then of course I rethought it and realized this is a book that is for those who are interested in the very essence of life and not just existing. I am sure we have all heard of the massive collider built is Switzerland that scientists believe will open some thoughts or visions on the big bang theory. You can accompany the author at the discovery of the Higgs Boson, this practically unmeasureable sub atomic particle that is the basis of the atom of which all things are created. The author explains all so clearly that even if a person has limited exposure to cosmology or psychics they will grasp a understanding. He creates some parallels of measurement that are impessive. I am sure we have all looked up at a midnight panaroma of our Milky Way galaxy but to realize it is composed of billions of star's like ours, some much bigger, some smaller, and they have their systems such as our solar system. Then we have exposed to us that all we see and much we do not see is all part of our Milky Way Galaxy, and beyond this at amazing distances are other galaxies. The reverse thought then comes with the discovery of the Boson that there are comparative places so much smaller and these are called atoms and it takes billions and billions to create anything be it gas, liquid, light, or solid. This is all so amazing and the author clearly explains it all to the reader. The most wonderful part is when we come to understand this is our universe and we are atom creations that exist within it. Please read it, you'll love it and I am sure if you haven't studied any of these fields you will get into it. This exposure is us, our past, present, and future."
28,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3539137-pammie,2,"I'd give this book more than 2 stars if there was a ""HUH???"" category. The writing was interesting and engaging, he told a lot of fascinating anecdotes, but it just doesn't counter the fact that I still don't understand what is going on with the Higgs boson. If I read this book two or three more times along some sort of Particle Physics for Dummies I might have a better handle on this stuff. Right now I still couldn't really answer the question of what the Higgs boson is, but that is not Carroll's fault. I did understand the part about the fields, so that's something. Loved the story about Robert Wilson of Fermilab wanting to sculpt a 32-ft tall metal obelisk for the reflecting pool, was told that all metalwork had to be done by union metalworkers, so he joined the union, went through the manditory apprenticeship and built the thing during his lunch hours and coffee breaks! I have a photo of myself in front of that sculpture---I may replace my profile picture with that one, except that I so love Frida as Maud'Dib...too bad you can't post 2 pics! Ha! Now I will move on to Mandarin Chinese...wonder if I will understand it better than I did this book. Nahhh....."
29,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"This is one of the popular scientific books I own on theoretical physics. Being a chemist myself, I am looking for understanding beyond the common understanding (Higss boson gives mass), but not going into the mathematical difficulties of quantum dynamics and the like (let us normalize the mathematical framework). So I am looking for books matching this requirement. The Particle at the End of the Universe provided just that. It is an intriguing read on the history of particle physics, in particular the marriage of the theories of electromagnetic and weak nuclear force resulting in the theoretical framework of the electroweak force with quantum field theory. As this predicts the existance of the Higgs field and the associated Higgs boson, the discovery of exactly this boson in 2012 at CERN was a major milestone for this theory. Sean Carroll brings a story with just the right of technicalities and the breakthrough ideas against an historical background in the 20th century for me. I will need to re-read this to really boost my understanding a bit, but this book helps me with my own questions. 4 stars"

He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand. That is these five words: ""not observed waves, observed particles"". In the background of the universe is the Higgs field and it is the vibration of this field that gives particles their mass. The author explains this and relates it to possible solutions to dark matter and dark energy. "

It's probably not the best first book to read on the subject, but it was my first, and I managed to comprehend several concepts. I was especially curious to learn that most physicists detest the so-called search for the ""God particle."" They are not all necessarily engaged in an atheistic cosmological quest. The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

39,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"I learned a lot about particle physics which I had only the slightest idea about.Story of a physicist (name? Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."
40,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"Sean Carroll relates the finding of the Higgs boson in a witty and engaging manner through the events and people as well as by introducing the science and methodology. His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story.

47,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29610639-hugh-mannfield,4,"The Particle at the End of the Universe by Sean M. Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

49,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,4,"This is an even-handed view of the big science of particle physics, focusing on the hubbub surrounding the 125 GeV Higgs Boson recently detected at CERN. The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
51,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
52,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
54,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

56,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”.

58,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Explaining the Higgs is a challenge at best. Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
59,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "

He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand.

The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story. The book is enhanced with two sections of photos, a prologue, an epilogue pointing to the future, three appendices (worth reading), a section on further reading, a reference section (by chapter), a section of acknowledgements, and an index."

77,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29610639-hugh-mannfield,4,"The Particle at the End of the Universe by Sean M. Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

79,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,4,"This is an even-handed view of the big science of particle physics, focusing on the hubbub surrounding the 125 GeV Higgs Boson recently detected at CERN. The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

80,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
81,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
82,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
84,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

85,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11017591-sam-knowles,5,"this book is amazing XD Shean Carrol does a great job chronicling the history and development of particle physics; from the steady international 'particle accelerator frenzy' giving away vast amounts of national (and university) investments into SSC's, LHC's and hoards of media publications spread all over the world on the subject. you even find out how and who invented the internet! but of course you also find the results of the actual LHC accelerator in action, more so for the infamous 'highs boson' particle. the primary interest of this little 125 Gev particle is not only for the supposed mas-giving properties (although only a fraction of it's total mass) but because of it's specialized decay patterns, and it's astounding ability to 'break' symmetries. nobody knows yet for sure if the higgs is really what the world makes it out to be, but they all know that it plays a fundamental role in the very kinematics and dynamics of massive bodies. without it most things would be moving at light speed, so most massive bodies would succumb to relativistic mechanics and would make Newtonian physics irrelevant. aside from that Shean here does give us a good insight on everything in the standard model, not just a higgs. you learn everything, from the simple fermions to the bosons and even it's antiparticle twins, such as the positron, the anti neutrino and even 'sqarks' a very weird name for a particle; this can all be learned with basic knowledge of science and a little background in quantum theory. you pretty much get educated on everything particle physics here, not to mention a little bit on quantum field theory and relativity. this a great read if you want a formal education on particle physics and learn about what's buzzing in the scientific community right now--this is a good start."
86,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”. Sean Carroll puts snippets of his own thoughts into this novel to supply you with a better understanding of the particular topic. I think readers that enjoy physics, are curious about physics, or just want to read would enjoy this book because it’s informative, and teaches you a lot about particle physics.

88,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Explaining the Higgs is a challenge at best. Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
89,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "
90,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"This was not an easy book to understand and the particle zoo plays a large role in the discussion and often I would lose my way only because the material is sometimes hard to follow, but the book covers everything you always wanted to know about the Higgs Boson and its field, but were afraid to ask.I absolutely loved the author's previous book, ""From Eternity to Here"", and couldn't wait for this book. He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand. That is these five words: ""not observed waves, observed particles"". In the background of the universe is the Higgs field and it is the vibration of this field that gives particles their mass. The author explains this and relates it to possible solutions to dark matter and dark energy. "

It's probably not the best first book to read on the subject, but it was my first, and I managed to comprehend several concepts. I was especially curious to learn that most physicists detest the so-called search for the ""God particle."" They are not all necessarily engaged in an atheistic cosmological quest. The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

99,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"I learned a lot about particle physics which I had only the slightest idea about.Story of a physicist (name? Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."
100,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"Sean Carroll relates the finding of the Higgs boson in a witty and engaging manner through the events and people as well as by introducing the science and methodology. His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story. The book is enhanced with two sections of photos, a prologue, an epilogue pointing to the future, three appendices (worth reading), a section on further reading, a reference section (by chapter), a section of acknowledgements, and an index."

Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

109,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,4,"This is an even-handed view of the big science of particle physics, focusing on the hubbub surrounding the 125 GeV Higgs Boson recently detected at CERN. The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

110,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
111,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
112,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
114,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

116,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”.

Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs.

He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "

General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."
130,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"Sean Carroll relates the finding of the Higgs boson in a witty and engaging manner through the events and people as well as by introducing the science and methodology. His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story. The book is enhanced with two sections of photos, a prologue, an epilogue pointing to the future, three appendices (worth reading), a section on further reading, a reference section (by chapter), a section of acknowledgements, and an index."

137,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29610639-hugh-mannfield,4,"The Particle at the End of the Universe by Sean M. Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

139,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,4,"This is an even-handed view of the big science of particle physics, focusing on the hubbub surrounding the 125 GeV Higgs Boson recently detected at CERN. The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

140,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
141,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
142,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."
143,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg,4,"“People underestimate the impact of a new reality.” – Joe Incandela, Spokesperson for the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron ColliderThis quote begins Sean Carroll’s description of the quest for the Higgs Boson. This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
144,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

145,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11017591-sam-knowles,5,"this book is amazing XD Shean Carrol does a great job chronicling the history and development of particle physics; from the steady international 'particle accelerator frenzy' giving away vast amounts of national (and university) investments into SSC's, LHC's and hoards of media publications spread all over the world on the subject. you even find out how and who invented the internet! but of course you also find the results of the actual LHC accelerator in action, more so for the infamous 'highs boson' particle. the primary interest of this little 125 Gev particle is not only for the supposed mas-giving properties (although only a fraction of it's total mass) but because of it's specialized decay patterns, and it's astounding ability to 'break' symmetries. nobody knows yet for sure if the higgs is really what the world makes it out to be, but they all know that it plays a fundamental role in the very kinematics and dynamics of massive bodies. without it most things would be moving at light speed, so most massive bodies would succumb to relativistic mechanics and would make Newtonian physics irrelevant. aside from that Shean here does give us a good insight on everything in the standard model, not just a higgs. you learn everything, from the simple fermions to the bosons and even it's antiparticle twins, such as the positron, the anti neutrino and even 'sqarks' a very weird name for a particle; this can all be learned with basic knowledge of science and a little background in quantum theory. you pretty much get educated on everything particle physics here, not to mention a little bit on quantum field theory and relativity. this a great read if you want a formal education on particle physics and learn about what's buzzing in the scientific community right now--this is a good start."
146,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”. Sean Carroll puts snippets of his own thoughts into this novel to supply you with a better understanding of the particular topic. I think readers that enjoy physics, are curious about physics, or just want to read would enjoy this book because it’s informative, and teaches you a lot about particle physics.

148,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Explaining the Higgs is a challenge at best. Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
149,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "
150,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"This was not an easy book to understand and the particle zoo plays a large role in the discussion and often I would lose my way only because the material is sometimes hard to follow, but the book covers everything you always wanted to know about the Higgs Boson and its field, but were afraid to ask.I absolutely loved the author's previous book, ""From Eternity to Here"", and couldn't wait for this book. He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand. That is these five words: ""not observed waves, observed particles"". In the background of the universe is the Higgs field and it is the vibration of this field that gives particles their mass.

It's probably not the best first book to read on the subject, but it was my first, and I managed to comprehend several concepts. I was especially curious to learn that most physicists detest the so-called search for the ""God particle."" They are not all necessarily engaged in an atheistic cosmological quest. The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this.

Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

170,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
171,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
172,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
174,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

176,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”.

Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs.

He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can.

Carroll tells the story of the particle in very easy way, so that everyone can understand that. "

189,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"I learned a lot about particle physics which I had only the slightest idea about.Story of a physicist (name? Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story. The book is enhanced with two sections of photos, a prologue, an epilogue pointing to the future, three appendices (worth reading), a section on further reading, a reference section (by chapter), a section of acknowledgements, and an index."

Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

200,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
201,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
202,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
204,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

205,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11017591-sam-knowles,5,"this book is amazing XD Shean Carrol does a great job chronicling the history and development of particle physics; from the steady international 'particle accelerator frenzy' giving away vast amounts of national (and university) investments into SSC's, LHC's and hoards of media publications spread all over the world on the subject. you even find out how and who invented the internet! but of course you also find the results of the actual LHC accelerator in action, more so for the infamous 'highs boson' particle. the primary interest of this little 125 Gev particle is not only for the supposed mas-giving properties (although only a fraction of it's total mass) but because of it's specialized decay patterns, and it's astounding ability to 'break' symmetries. nobody knows yet for sure if the higgs is really what the world makes it out to be, but they all know that it plays a fundamental role in the very kinematics and dynamics of massive bodies. without it most things would be moving at light speed, so most massive bodies would succumb to relativistic mechanics and would make Newtonian physics irrelevant. aside from that Shean here does give us a good insight on everything in the standard model, not just a higgs. you learn everything, from the simple fermions to the bosons and even it's antiparticle twins, such as the positron, the anti neutrino and even 'sqarks' a very weird name for a particle; this can all be learned with basic knowledge of science and a little background in quantum theory. you pretty much get educated on everything particle physics here, not to mention a little bit on quantum field theory and relativity. this a great read if you want a formal education on particle physics and learn about what's buzzing in the scientific community right now--this is a good start."
206,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”. Sean Carroll puts snippets of his own thoughts into this novel to supply you with a better understanding of the particular topic.

208,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Explaining the Higgs is a challenge at best. Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
209,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "

He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand. That is these five words: ""not observed waves, observed particles"". In the background of the universe is the Higgs field and it is the vibration of this field that gives particles their mass.

The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged.

He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect.

Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

230,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
231,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
232,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
234,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

236,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”.

Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs.

239,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "

He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand. That is these five words: ""not observed waves, observed particles"". In the background of the universe is the Higgs field and it is the vibration of this field that gives particles their mass. The author explains this and relates it to possible solutions to dark matter and dark energy. "

It's probably not the best first book to read on the subject, but it was my first, and I managed to comprehend several concepts. I was especially curious to learn that most physicists detest the so-called search for the ""God particle."" They are not all necessarily engaged in an atheistic cosmological quest. The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

260,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
261,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
262,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
264,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

265,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11017591-sam-knowles,5,"this book is amazing XD Shean Carrol does a great job chronicling the history and development of particle physics; from the steady international 'particle accelerator frenzy' giving away vast amounts of national (and university) investments into SSC's, LHC's and hoards of media publications spread all over the world on the subject. you even find out how and who invented the internet! but of course you also find the results of the actual LHC accelerator in action, more so for the infamous 'highs boson' particle. the primary interest of this little 125 Gev particle is not only for the supposed mas-giving properties (although only a fraction of it's total mass) but because of it's specialized decay patterns, and it's astounding ability to 'break' symmetries. nobody knows yet for sure if the higgs is really what the world makes it out to be, but they all know that it plays a fundamental role in the very kinematics and dynamics of massive bodies. without it most things would be moving at light speed, so most massive bodies would succumb to relativistic mechanics and would make Newtonian physics irrelevant. aside from that Shean here does give us a good insight on everything in the standard model, not just a higgs. you learn everything, from the simple fermions to the bosons and even it's antiparticle twins, such as the positron, the anti neutrino and even 'sqarks' a very weird name for a particle; this can all be learned with basic knowledge of science and a little background in quantum theory. you pretty much get educated on everything particle physics here, not to mention a little bit on quantum field theory and relativity. this a great read if you want a formal education on particle physics and learn about what's buzzing in the scientific community right now--this is a good start."
266,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Overall, engaging reading with fun personal stories and physics.I didn't understand everything in this book, but I understand a lot more about particle physics, quantum mechanics, and even the Higgs boson than before reading it. The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”.

268,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Explaining the Higgs is a challenge at best. Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
269,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "

He's such a good writer and explains better than almost anyone. There are enough good parts in this book to make the particle zoo part worth listening to.There's one important theme that runs through the book that will make the book easier to understand.

The term ""God particle"" owes its popularity to journalists attempting to market their headlines.It is a curious thing to note however, that it takes the genius of thousands of physicists using the largest and most costly machine ever built to only begin to understand the way subatomic particles behave, and yet many still assume the universe has a simple materialistic basis.

Juan Hewitt), who has been waiting for LHC for 25 years (SSC in USA was cancelled by Congress).Moment of discovery of the Higgs boson, 4 July 2012.3 types of fundamental particles: bosons, fermios and the Higgs. The Higgs particles arises from the Higgs field, which pervades space. Higgs field is always there. Without it particles would be massless and there would be no atoms.This is of course not 100% discovery, but it's a particle which behaves exactly like we expect the Higgs boson to.Chapter 1Why dedicate life time and money on this. The last experimental discovery in particle physics before the Higgs goes back to the 1970s. All of them confirm our theories (the standard model), which is not necessarily good news. Author thinks it's better to tear down the old theories and discover more about the universe. He hopes for surprises from LHC. Higgs boson was the last piece in the standard model.The ancient question for the fundemental parts of reality. The Greek idea of the 5 fundamental elements: air, earth, fire, water and quintessence. Democritus and the Atomists. This name is not accurate with the atom, since atoms are divisible.What they meant with atoms we call elementary particles such as electrons, up quarcks and down quarcks. In total they are 12: 6 quarcks and 6 leptons. In addition to 4 force carrying particles. The Higgs boson too. There is also Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are not in the Standard Model.Higgs boson is a force carrying particle, but different from the others. It's an ugly addition and a mess to the otherwise tidy standard model. It's still early to say we have found the Higgs.Why do we care? Innate curiosity. Historically scientific research for its own sake has led to massive tangible benefits. Lists examples 1831 Michael Faraday you'll be able to tax it. Quantum mechanics which nothing but an anbstract idea led to transistors, super conductors, nuclear power and weapons and lasers. General Relativity led to GPS.However the real purpose of science is not its technological applications, but its ability to solve puzzles and answer our deep question.The LHC history. Law suits that it might create black holes!Higgs particle could be the link to Dark Matter. With no surprises and new findimgs it's going to be difficult to convince governments to finance such huge projects. Politics play a major role.Chapter 2: Next to GodlynessHiggs has nothing to do with God. Letterman, a nobel lauriet called it the God Particle (he authored a book with that title). Scientists hate this name, while journalists love it. The Goddamn Particle.The story of scientists and using the word God. Einstein I want to know the thoughts of Gid and Gid doesn't play dice. Stephen Hawkings and The Mind of God. Others too.In the past scientists used to be religious. Newton and George Lamètre. Nowadays physicists are more likely to be atheists than the general population. They see the universe as working by itself without super natural agents.So what do they mean with the word God? The universe. To anthropomorphise the laws of nature and universe. The other reason is public relations of course. A marketing genius. It gets huge attention from people when you call it the God Particle.Laws of nature and the unreasonable success of mathematics in physics (by Eugene Wegner).Discusses even the title of this book LOL. There is no end for the universe; it's a metaphor.The Standard Model is missing Gravity, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.Scientists knew the Hoggs existen even before detecting it because without it the electrons will have 0 mass and move at the speed of light. Many things in reality would've been different if it didn't exist.Fermions can't occupy the same space as each other, while bosons can . Fermions have mass. The smaller the mass of the particle the more space it takes. So electrons are what give matter it's solidity (their mass is 1/2000 of a proton). The atom has 3 elementary particles only, up quarck, down quarck and the electron.Bosons are the force carrying particles and can combines and stack on each other to make a force field. 2 bosons or 2 trillion boson can sit in the same space right on top if each other.Force, interaction and coupling can be used interchangeably. Forces can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of particles or vibrations in fields.Forces are carried by the bosons, which include the yet to be seen individually graviton. Describes the four forces. Quarcks are always combined together with the gluons to form hadrons.The weak force converts protons to neutrons. It has 3 bosons, Z boson and 2 W bosons, one positive (+) and the other negative (-). These 3 bosons are heavy, unlike the rest which are massless. This contributes to the weakness of the weak nuclear power.The weak force is strange. A down quarck can spit a W- and change to up quarck. They change the particles they interact with.The Higgs field is way more interesting than the particle. All particles arise from fields (quantum field theory). Fundemental fields have value at all places in space. Everything is made of a field or a complications of a field. Particles are tiny vibrating waves in those fields (every kind of boson and feemion have its own field - a gluon field, an electron field, an up quarck field etc).QM can be summarized as ""Don't look waves, look particles"".More mass means more energy means shorter waves means smaller size (and vice versa).Empty space = zero energy = zero value for fields. Quantum fluctuations. Higgs field is different, it always has a constant value, and it provides a medium for other particles to move.""The world is made of fields, substances spread all through space that we notice through their vibrations which appear to us as particles.""العالم مكون من مجالات، وهي مواد منتشرة في كل أنحاء الفضاء، نحس بها عن طريق اهتزازاتها التي تظهر لنا على شكل جزيئات.The weak nuclear force gives all particles mass. Breaking of symmetries. The Higgs field breaks the symmetry of the weak force and therefore it can give mass to particles.Chapter 3: Atoms and ParticlesTakes on homeopathy [a strange move for a physics book].Will take a tour on all particles. In 1897 the the first [regular shiny] matter particle: the elecron was discovered and in 2000 the last matter particle: the Tao neutrino was found.The typical cartoon of the atom known as the Bohr model is misleading and goes to the old days of quantum theory. Electrons don't orbit the nucleus, they are clouds of probabilities known as wave functions.Electrons don't feel the strong force as protons and neutrons. As the nucleus gets bigger it becomes less stable and the EM force becomes larger than strong force.Antimatter. Paul Dirac. Why matter dominates antimatter. Carl Anderson experiment to prove existence of positrons. By this stage neutrons, protons, electrons and their antimatter counter parts were all the known particles.Neutrinos. Wolfgang Pauli and anreko Fermi. Now we had 2 large particles proton and neutron which were dupped hadrons, one of them charged and the other neutral. And two small particles dupped the leptons, electron and neutrino, one charged and one neutral. They thought they had it all until..In 1931 the Muon is discovered by Carl Anderson and Seth Myer. Negatively charged, but heavier than electron. ""Who ordered that?"" Now scientists hope for a similar moment. Muon neutrino. In 1970s the Tau particle is discovered. Negatice but even heavier. All interact with EM and weak force. Tau neutrino discovered in 2000. Three generations of particles, any more?A boom in hadron particles. 1964 Marry Gell-Man suggests that quarcks the elementary particles which made all the others. 6 different types. Up quarcks (up, charm and top) have a charge of +2/3 while the down quarcks (down, strange and bottom) have a charge of -1/3.Each type represents a triplet of quarcks and not just one, labelled red, green and blue. Each proton and neutron has 3 quarck each of different color. Antiquarcks come on color and anticolor types. The total of the 3 colors is white. The colors are only metaphorical.Higgs role is a breaker of symmetry.Gauge bosons, except the Graviton have a spin of 1. Graviton has a spin of 2. Higgs is a scalar boson with 0 spin. Higgs boson interacts with all of the particles (maybe except neutrinos). The more strongly a particle couples with the higgs (and therefore interact with its field) the more massive it is. The Higgs boson is massive itself, 200 times more massive than the proton.Chapter 4: The accelerator storyElectron volt as a unit (eV). Mega giga and tera. All particle masses is measured by eV as well. An electron is about 0.5 MeV, and proton 1 GeV. Higgs boson is 125 GeV. LHC is 8 TeV to be upgraded to 12. History of accelerators. The Bavetron. Smashing particles to form new ones and not to break them apart. High energy leads to higher speeds but as your approach he speed of light you require more and more energy. Particles are accelerated with electricity and controlled with magnetism.The different accelators. IRS. LEP (electron-positron) at CERN. LHC at CERN. Moom gravity affected the CERN tunnel by 1 milimeter a day. Even trains did so. LEP dismantled in 2000. It reached up to 200GeV at the last of its runs, almost seeing the Huggs boson. They found some evidence for the Higgs, but it was not statistically significant due to background noice. LEP retired before making it to the Higgs.USA accelators.Tavetron accelerator at Fermi lab in Chicago 115 GeV.SLAC linear accelerator (ring later added). Had big role in discovering the quarcks (confirming their existence) Brockhaven. Fermi lab. This lab had Tavetron accelerator colliding protons and antiprotons at 2 TeV. Found the top quarck. The stronest accelerator after the LCH. Came close to finding the Higgs boson. Closed at 2011.Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Approved by Regan in 1987. Energy would have been up to 40 TeV. Budget costs led to scrambling it (International Space Station costed about $100 billion and SSC $12 billion.) Congress voted to cancel it. Other physics specialists were not supoortive either. Their research was also cut by the same congress.Chapter 5: The Largest Machine Even BuiltLHC lunch on 10 September 2008. First run ok, but exploded after 9 days later. To maintain the superconductivity the temperature of the magnets and wires must be maintained at 3.4 Kelvin by liquid hydrogen. The fault happened in this area and 50/~1000 magnets at LHC had to replaced. The explosion happen while it was not working, but no one was harmed.Minor problem caused by a pigeon. Afterwards it worked smoothly and the Higgs was found. It is the largest and most complicated machine built by humans (from 70 countries -Palestinians and Israelis, Iranians and Americans) and it works!LHC collides protons against protons. The plans and steps to build it. The role of Len Avens in overcoming the obstacles.How the LHC soeeds up protons and maintain them within the course. 2 circulating beams, each containing protons going in opposite directions. 500 trillion protons each with the energy of 7 TeV (resting energy is 1 GeV) reaching speeds of ~99.9999996% of speed of light. Such high energy is equivalent to 125 thousand pounds of TNT. They are dumped into graphite (which doesn't melt at high temperatures) sealed in steel and concrete shielding.The LCH is not a circle, but a curved octagon (8 sections) Dipole magnets are the most expensive conponent of it (their price is the same as the finest chocolate, 17 miles of it). In total is costed 9 billion dollars.The ultimate goal for LHC is to get to 14 TeV.Chapter 6: Wisdom through smashingCompares paleontology to theoretical physics.How to detect particles when they only last for fractions of a second. They decay into other particles. Analyzing the data. Detect mass, charge and interaction of the particles.Hadrons are 2 types: Baryons which contain 3 quarcks and mesons which contain a quarck and an anti-quarcks. Many of these hadrons are smashed into each other to study different things e.g. the inner composition of the proton and the early universe.Experiments: ATLAS, CMS (total are 7).A proton is not really just 3 quarcks. It has tons of virtual particles (quarcks and antiquarcks) and gluons. What we have is two up quarcks more than anti-up quarcks and 1 down quarck more than the anti-down quarcks. The 3 quarcks are known as the valent quarcks. The whole collection of is known as patrons.When protons collide, only 1 patron from each interact with one another so it is hard to estimate the energies involved. Analyses and calculations are somewhat hard.W bosons, Z bosons, Higgs bosons and Tau leptons are heavy and decay into other particles faster than we can detect, so we only know of their existence indirectly (Tau leptons may be detected directly in the right conditions).Electrons and photons are very easy to detect.Neutrinos and Gravitons both don't interact with (or ""feel"") the strong force or the EM force. So colliders can't detect them. Neutrinos interact with the weak force (they are produced by the colliders, but cannot be felt by it).Muons. 200 times heavier than electrons. Negatively charged. Detectable.Luis Alvares and testing the pyramids with muons. Negative results.Muons are produced by weak force or something else?Too much data (100 million collisions a second) leading to data storage problems. That's 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) a second. Therefore most data are not actually saved at all. After several filters only 100s of the 100 million collisions are saved per second.Data transmission system. Led to the internet?Chapter 7: particles in the wavesInsane clown pussy band song about how magnets work. The question is actually good. Action at a distance? No, the space is filled with magnetic field. The field is always there in every point in space.Particle physics is truly field physics.""Quantum fields are the ultimate building block of reality as we currently understand it.""The fuelds are not made of anything, the world is made out of the fields. No underlying reality below them, except maybe strings, but that is hypothetical. All reality is vibrations in fields.Newton and gravity. He couldn't explain it ""action at a distance"". Laplase envisages it as a field.EM fields. Electricity and magnesium know long ago. Hans Christian Arsted saw the connection between them and before him even Benjamin Franklin. Michael Faraday and Maxwell unified it.EM waves are light.Gravitation waves. Netwon > Laplas > Einstein. Metric tensors. 1993 indirect confirmation of gravitation waves by looking at binary neutron stars. [In 2015, it was directly detected by LIGO].Light wave or particle. Quantum theory unified both. ""Everything is made of fields, but when we look closely you see particles.""Very distant objects don't disappear, they flicker and what we see is a photon. He mentions The Fabric of Reality book which I'm also currently reading (almost finished it - page 340s).Story of quanta with Max Plank. Shorter wave length = higher energy. This applies to everything. Higher mass = higher energy = shorter wave lengths. This is why electrons occupy more space than protons and neutrons, they have less mass therefore less energy therefore longer wave lengths therefore they take the largest space.Einstein photo-electric effect. Intensity vs energy (wave length).The name photon was coined by Gilber Luis in 1920s and popularized by Arthur Compton.Quantum mechanics one of 2 largest revolutions in physics. The first is the Newtonian classical mechanics.Virtual particles. Uncertainty.""Matter is really waves - quantum fields, but when we look at it carefully enough, we see particles.""If we look gravitation waves enough we should see the massless gravitons.Bosons and fermions are waves. Pauli exclusion principle applies to fermions only.This helped in explaining the fact that particles can be created or destroyed. Neutrons decay into protons and release an electron and anti-neutrino. Where did these come from? Anreko Fermi was the first to apply quantum field theory to fermions. The vibrations in neutron field are transmitted to the proton, electron and anti-neutrino fields.Higgs boson decays into 2 photons. Why? Virtual particles should be thought of as virtual fields. Higgs turns into virtually charged massive particles which turn into photons.Conservation laws. Of energy, of quarcks of leptons and of electric charge. Neutrons have 3 quarcks, 0 charge and 0 leptons. Their decay results in the same. The proton contains 3 quarcks. The charge of the proton and electron cancel each other. The anti neutrino is a negative lepton and cancels out the positive lepton of the electron i.e. 1+ (-1) = 0.The more massive a particle is the less stable. Higgs is really massive and so unstable. Neutrons when alone are unstable, but when put next to the stable protons they become stable.Chapter 8: through a broken mirrorWhat's so big deal about the Higgs?""The Higgs is a field that permeates space giving heft to particles like electrons allowing them to form atoms, which bind into molecules. Without the Higgs there wouldn't be atoms, there would just be a bunch particles zooming separately across the universe.""The Higgs field is all around us just like water for fish and air for us. It has a positive value even in empty space. Without it life would be impossible. No atoms.The analogy of you and a famous person going through a room while its empty at first and reaching the end at the same time (symmetry), and the second time there are a lot of people and they hold up the famous person and therefore you reach first and they move slowly (break of symmetry). The people are like the Higgs field.The resting energy state of the Higgs field (i.e. at empty space) is not zero; it's 246 GeV. We don't know why.Energy and mass. Gravity affects even massless particles such as photon (as seen in gravitational lensing).Particles that interact with the Higgs field strongly get higher mass and vice versa. Neutrinos have small mass, but it is not well understood from where it comes. Since the Highs is always in the background, the massive particles always have mass proportional to their interaction strength with he Higgs. Why some particles interact strongly than others? We don't know yet.It is misleading to simply say that the Higgs is responsible for the mass. This ignores the strong interactions and virtual particles effects.What woud happen if the Higgs field energy was lowered? Not much for most massive particles except the electron, for its size and therefore the size of the atom will increase. This will disrupt chemical reactions and make life impossible. Atoms may even get as big as the solar system.With zero Higgs field, the electron will escape the atom (the popcorn bag will explode). Also all the up quarcks (up charm top) will be the same. All down quarcks will be the same. All charged leptons will be the same. Since the only real difference between those is their mass, and with 0 Higgs field it's all gone. This is what we mean by breaking the symmetry; making them different.Symmetry. Circles have perfect symmetry from all angles. Symmetrical reactions are called translation in variance. Rotational symmetry. Local vs global symmetry. Importance of symmetry and its relation to forces of nature. Gauge symmetry and Gauge bosons."

His presentation of the physics is basic -- so do not be put off by this. In fact, his explanation of the ideas and methodology make the book more interesting than just repeating a who did what story. More importantly, the scope of the work precludes a who did what story.

287,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29610639-hugh-mannfield,4,"The Particle at the End of the Universe by Sean M. Carroll.The Higgs Boson?In this book, Sean Carroll tells the story of the building and operation of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) in the search for the Higgs boson. He also explains the standard model and attempts to explain what the Higgs boson is and why it was worth 9 billion dollars to find it. I say attempts because after reading the entire book, including all appendixes, I can’t say I fully understand it. This is not because Sean has failed as an author. He has written the most understandable book on General Relativity out there, (Spacetime and Geometry) bringing GR within the grasp of more humans than ever before. Sean knows how to explain things. The problem is that short of an getting an advanced degree in particle physics, you won’t be able to understand it (and maybe not even then.)In the first few chapters Sean attackes the problem from several different directions and I became a little frustrated as a reader as he retraced and reiterated the logic. What came across is that a lot of smart people got together and convinced governments around the world to spend billions building a giant machine to look for something that they couldn’t really explain and weren’t really sure they could find or would even be able to recognize it if they did. I tip my hat to them for pulling it off. Without regard to the Higgs boson, that part of the story is worth reading.9 billion dollars can buy a lot. It always annoyed me when NASA critics said, “We should spend that money fixing things here on Earth, feeding the hungry, or curing disease.” Still tons of other research could have been done with this money. Was it worth it? There is no use debating that now, the job is done, the Higgs is found. Maybe. Anyway, that money stimulated many economies around the world and lots of new technology was developed to build the LHC. Even so, the Higgs boson never fed a hungry child (except perhaps the children of physicists.) This may be the last large project of its kind we will see. I think bureaucrats are going to be a lot more difficult to convince next time around.So where is my freak’n hover board?! Did we learn anything useful? Will the Higgs boson be helping us build warp drive starships anytime soon? Sean tackles these questions late in the book as he tries to bring home the significance of the discovery. Still he admits that you won’t be seeing Higgs powered computer cores, pogo sticks, or anything else for that matter. The Higgs boson just does not lend itself to commercial application. The bulk of the second half of the book is spent explaining the successes and failures of the standard model.	Reading this book made me feel a bit sorry for particle physicists. I don’t believe they are really that much smarter than the rest of us. They spend their lives groping around in the darkness of the infinitesimal, trying to understand the foundation of reality. My best analogy for their plight is this; imagine it is your job to predict the behavior of clouds while not being allowed to use the properties of air. They are also wedded to the standard model, but she is a big, warty, bride with a perplexing dark side who is no fun at parties. She gets the job done, but they can’t wait to dump her as soon as a sexy young theory with the right stuff comes along. (My hopes are on Fluid Space Theory).I recommend this book for the scientifically inclined, some parts would interest general readers but it is not in any way an action thriller and certainly will take more than one sitting to get through. It is a well crafted book and the only errors I noticed were a few mislabeled particles in two of the figures.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield."

289,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801050-mike-dangerous,4,"This is an even-handed view of the big science of particle physics, focusing on the hubbub surrounding the 125 GeV Higgs Boson recently detected at CERN. The author, Sean Carroll, is a real physicist (not a fake one). His lectures and books are precise and clear. The book does a pretty good job of not insulting scientists or the general public. The author is a proponent of fundamental research, including expensive research, yet manages to avoid the stereotypical arrogance of scientists when considering the huddled masses.Toward the end of the book, the author recites one of my favorite improvised, think-on-your-feet, quotations of all time. Here it is, along with the context.Robert Wilson, the physicist who was in charge of building Fermilab, was dragged before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1969 to help senators and representatives understand the motivation behind the multimillion-dollar project. It was a turning point in the history of particle physics in the United States; the Manhattan Project had given physicists easy access to influence and funding, but it was unclear how the search for new elementary particles was going to lead to anything as immediately valuable as a new kind of weapon. Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island asked Wilson directly: ""Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of the country?"" Wilson answered with equal directness: ""No, sir, I don’t believe so."" We can imagine that Pastore was a bit taken aback by this answer; presumably he expected to hear a song and dance about how Fermilab played a crucial role in keeping up with the Soviets, the kind of argument that was trotted out for all kinds of purposes in that era. He asked if there was really nothing at all, to which Wilson simply replied, ""Nothing at all."" But you don’t get to be senator without being at least a little stubborn, so Pastore tried a third time, just to ensure he had heard correctly: ""It has no value in that respect?"" Wilson was no dummy; he realized he was expected to provide a little bit more if he wanted Congress to fund his ambitious but esoteric endeavor, but he refused to back off from his original point. His answer is one of the most-remembered quotes in the long history of scientists trying to explain why they do what they do:It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of man, our love of culture. It has to do with: Are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean all the things we really venerate in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.Carroll, Sean (2012-11-13).

290,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,4,"While I have been aware (in a layperson's way) of the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs particle for quite a while, this book fills in the details very well and from multiple perspectives. To choose just a few: 1) I always appreciate science books that reach beyond the genius scientists themselves and take note of the complimentary contribution of others in supporting roles. Here, the author provides a narrative of the design, construction, testing, start-up, - disaster! -, review, recovery, and ultimate successful operation of the LHC, noting the contribution of many engineers, materials scientists, and others to the proper functioning of a machine whose construction alone pushed the technological envelope. In addition, there is a detailed explanation of the design and operation of the detectors themselves and the mind-boggling computing power harnessed to find the collision outcomes that are most likely to yield useful data; 2) Although the majority of the popular press coverage focuses on the particle itself, the author gracefully pivots from the Higgs particle to the associated Higgs Field and the significance of a field with a nonzero value that pervades all of space. Before digging into the details, a very effective primer on fields is provided using easy to follow analogies. I found this early treatment helpful as a lead-in to more complicated topics presented later in the book; 3) One of the strengths of the book is that it addresses the ""now what?"" question quite thoroughly. OK, we found the God Particle that completes the Standard Model, what else can we get from the $9 billion invested in the LHC? Thankfully, there are many good answers to that question (as far as I can tell) including potential applications to string theory, M-theory and super symmetry. Among the intriguing questions remaining open is whether we found ""the"" Higgs particle or ""a"" Higgs particle.I did refer to the appendices for a deeper dive into some of the physics. If I had any criticism, it is that, although I understand the issue, I don't really need to resolve the question of which physicists are more or less deserving of the credit for the various discoveries associated with the Higgs particle and field. Certainly a full (and lengthy) chapter is overkill. Similarly, I do not need what seems to be an obligatory final chapter in may of these books justifying continued funding of basic scientific research (although I always enjoy the story of Robert Wilson's encounter with Sen. Pastore during hearings on the funding of Fermilab). These minor criticisms are not the takeaway. In all, this is an excellent treatment of a complicated topic that anyone with a basic science education can read and enjoy."
291,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"There are many good popular books where larger than life theoretical scientists are the focus but few where experimental science/scientists are given the centre stage. This book is clearly in the latter category and is a result refreshing and also tremendously difficult. The book is possibly a great reminder of the post 1970-era where it is less and less about individual scientists and their grand theories and more about statistical evidences, giant machines built by multiple governments and equations that even fastest computers take days/years to process just partially.Both quantum physics and modern cosmology have taken science to a point where observations of new particles and new correlations are as fascinating as Columbus sighting America. This makes the observation/discovery science bewildering, almost meaningless, statistically speculative, apparently irrational as we define rationality and detail-oriented. The classical understanding - of the kind we learn in school/college science classes that provide a structure to what is going on - is just not feasible. This book starts where the conventional understanding ends - ie, post relativistic/early quantum mechanics days of theoretical science. It directly dives into the exotic era of completely new particles, energy, fields, interactions and their discoveries. It takes it for granted that the readers here are familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauli etc. As a result, the book is often difficult to fathom. However, the author's repetitive explanations and simple analogies do provide at least some method to the madness. The most important topic, the unidentified boson, its discovery and the discoverer CERN, are all adequately covered. Some of the parts are likely to disappoint almost any reader as the author skips between funding politics, short discussions on competitions between scientists, statistics behind the discovery and various diverse topics all the time while still maintaining the thread on sub-atomic particles. This is a book about where the sciences are now as against the dozens of books that love to talk about the fairy-tale like pre-WW 2 leaps in theoretical sciences. Difficult but different. Makes the world much less meaningful while shattering the child-like fantasies of some GUT that could be understood by anyone while providing an end to science/religion/philosophy in some distant future but such is life!"
292,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23504255-graemeg,3,"A very specific and intriguing recount of the story of the HiggsFrom visualization to experimental success, Sean Carroll walks the reader through the process of discovering and proving the so-called Higgs Boson in this non-fiction introduction to its properties. Written in very understandable language, but still covering somewhat complex topics that reader is assumed to be familiar with, it is a book that is certainly geared for a moderately-educated audience in terms of knowledge on particle dynamics.The book is divided into sections, beginning with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of physics, then jumping into the experimentation and discovery for a large portion of the book, before finally covering the implications of the Higgs’ discovery. The first and last sections are exceptionally gripping and mind-boggling. What surprised me the most was his ability to provide multiple analogies for each concept that was difficult to grasp. Where the book really lost its potenial for a 5 star rating is in the middle section.Thick with acronyms and historical facts on the development of the machines used in particle collisions, the middle section is very slow and at times is almost painful to read. One can only see an acronym used about 15 times before they just get aggravating.Relative to other physics books I’ve read, including many of the works of Stephen Hawking, The Particle at the End of the Universe is a much more technical and specific story of only a small aspect of the physical universe, whereas the others are much more broad and cover more topics. I found sections of this book interesting enough to read them over and over, and others so drab that they needed to be skimmed as fast as possible.Overall, I would only recommend this book to those interested in this fantastic discovery, but would suggest some previous reading into particle physics (the best introduction would be “A Brief History of Time” by Stephen Hawking). If you don’t mind a slow section on history and are willing to read the book cover to cover, it will definitely be one of your most enlightening reads yet."

This book was written before most of the huge discoveries were announced, but it is a wonderful read regardless. Carroll describes for the curious reader what the LHC is all about, and what it is looking for. There are funny notes interspersed throughout, such as the following quote: “Way back in 1831, Michael Faraday, one of the founders of our modern understanding of electromagnetism, was asked by an inquiring politician about the usefulness of this newfangled ""electricity"" stuff. His apocryphal reply: ""I know not, but I wager that one day your government will tax it"".” The theories themselves can be mindbending, particular quantum and string theories. “The electric field and the gravitational field might seem familiar, but according to quantum field theory even particles like electrons and quarks are really vibrations in certain kinds of fields.” What might be obvious to a theoretical physicist is miindblowing to me.At times, it is easy to be awed by the precision instrumentation and the scale of the engineering. “Each day, the moon’s gravitational field tugs at the earth as it rotates underneath. At CERN, this tiny stress caused the total length of the LEP tunnel to stretch and contract by about a millimeter (one-twenty-fifth of an inch) every day. Not such a big deal in a seventeen-mile-long beam pipe, but enough to cause a tiny fluctuation in the energy of the electrons and positrons—one that was easily detectable by the high-precision instruments. After some initial puzzlement at the daily energy variations, the CERN physicists quickly figured out what was going on.” The world being studied here is the world of small, but hugely impactful, natural forces. “Historically, nature has been very good at surprising us.” I couldn’t have said it better. Great book.See my other reviews here!"
294,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,4,"This book does a superb job as a history of, and explanation of the importance of the Large Hadron Collider under Geneva. I learned a great deal about the physical setup of CERN, but also about the international collaborations that plan, conduct and analyze the experiments run there. In many ways, this is a triumph of international science- and a fascinating story to boot! The book was a little less successful in explaining exactly what makes the Higgs boson so special. Even though I read painstakingly through the technical appendices at the end, I still don't understand what the ""spin"" or ""flavor"" of a quark is. Perhaps these are concepts that can be grasped only by people with great mathematical ability, and not so much by people who rely on words. On the other hand, I do now understand the difference between ""bosons' and ""hadrons"" and ""leptons"". So I did put the book down with the feeling that I knew more than before I picked it up, which is a very satisfying outcome. The author interviewed, or is personally acquainted with, many of the scientists involved in these fascinating experiments. He is therefore capable of conveying the sense of excitement and fun that is such an intrinsic part of all endeavors that are based on curiosity. Another strong point is his ability to explain the history of an idea : a first experiment with an anomalous result that makes the scientist believe that there may be an as-yet-undiscovered particle involved, followed by the mathematical calculations that seem to prove that such a particle could exist, followed by the actual evidence of said particle in CERN. This trajectory can take 30 years, but the author did a good job of condensing it in a few easy-to-read pages. All in all I recommend this book to people with an interest in the current state of particle physics, or even people wondering what that huge underground particle accelerator under Geneva is actually good for.

The relationship of symmetry to forces meant nothing to me, despite analogies. I think I'd have to study the ugly equations themselves for years, perhaps, to understand the theory better. And I won't be doing that, since I'm doing other things. But I did manage to understand something of why they need another field to give mass to quarks, electrons, and so on. I even know what ""lepton"" and ""hadron"" and so on mean by now.Importantly, I understand how the detection of particles into which a Higgs boson decays are detected as statistical anomalies. The plots on photon pair detection rate in the book don't excite me much, for reasons I won't go into, but if that many smart people say it's 3-4 sigma (with other events providing more evidence), they probably are doing okay, at least.There are mistakes in this book. There are at least 2 diagrams with clearly wrong labels, which implies some limited time spent on quality review. I don't know how many mistakes I didn't catch.Carroll does wander into scientifically weak ground of the meaning of life and of religion (showing atheist tendencies, whereas I'm a Christian myself [and more specifically Mormon]). To his credit, he doesn't overdo it as much as some. When he's wise, he even admits these are outside science. I do like his presentation, though, of how much scientists love what they do.For context, I had through 200-level college physics, and I'm working on a PhD in computer science / artificial intelligence."

Throughout the novel, he expresses his thoughts, and provides his intuition on provoking topics. “God Particle” is the alternative name given to the Higgs Boson by Leon Lederman. The term itself is used to emphasize the Higgs Boson’s significance and importance. Many people, including some physicist, like the name. Carroll, though a fellow physicist, riposte saying, ”Leon Lederman has had second thoughts. He knows what he has done, but he can’t take it back. It’s just one of those small things that has enormous unexpected consequences”. Most authors would prefer not to say something shady about another individual, but Sean does so to convey what he thinks of the name, “God Particle”. Sean Carroll puts snippets of his own thoughts into this novel to supply you with a better understanding of the particular topic. I think readers that enjoy physics, are curious about physics, or just want to read would enjoy this book because it’s informative, and teaches you a lot about particle physics.

Thanks to Sean M Carroll's talent for taking incredibly complex concepts and making them accessible to the masses, this is one of the best science books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It can be enjoyed by a seasoned physicist as well as someone who has never had a physics class but is curious about the universe in which they live. Often it is the case that books offer too much or too little detail. Carroll gets it just right. He does condense information such that you might be required to read some sections multiple times, but the information is all there. Every once in w while I would learn something in one chapter that made me revisit previous chapters in order to gain a firmer understanding of the material. It was worth it. Carroll is exquisitely gifted at laying breadcrumbs in just the right way so that you are led directly to the main point, a point that has thus far been incredibly difficult to explain to people-- even physicists. He gathers a lot of information, things many people know already, and puts them together in way that makes the universe so clear. Even what we already know can be put together in just the right way to help us make connections we didn't previously make, and that changes the whole scope of our understanding about what is around us. Carroll is possibly the best science writer of our time. I suggest that in addition to reading his book, you watch his talk on the Higgs. His talk is even better than his book. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwdY7E..."
299,0525953590,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Sean Carroll has enough sense and humor to understand that, in order for theoretical physics to get its message across the board, you need to have analogies that (more or less) work to explain the mind-blowing, upside down, counter-intuitive, and beautiful ways in which our physical world is constructed. He also knows he probably lost a lot of readers along the way, and he cheers on those who are still with him. Even though I read this from cover to cover, I cannot say that I understood everything, but I did get the gist and I am definitely less ignorant than I was before I picked it up. Not only am I less ignorant, I am now on a path to read similar books on everything there is to know about the knowable universe. I figure that if I read enough books about these subjects, I'll eventually be able to explain this stuff to myself, at least. For someone who managed to fail only one subject (Physics) during her entire academic life, I was enthralled by this book. That's how engaging Carroll is. I laughed out loud more than once. He affords many interesting comparisons to situations and objects that someone not working at the Large Hadron Collider is familiar with, and, though he admits those comparisons lack this or that subtlety, it takes people like me a step closer to understanding the wonderful things that these scientists are discovering for humankind. Before reading this, I was the sort of person who, to quote Carroll, ""couldn't tell a boson from a bonbon"". Now, I'm happy to say, that at least I think I can. That's a big step for unscientific me. "
