0,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"You have to make it past the 2/3rd of the book that’s about bird and duck sex to get to the part about why men have dangly penises. Not that the bird sex isn’t fascinating, but obviously I’m much more curious about human sex. This book was so interesting. Aesthetic beauty as an evolutionary force. I totally buy it. I read the Red Queen and some of the adaptation arguments for gaudy bird wings seemed crazy (like it was a signaling that the bird was so healthy that he could spare the extra plumage). This book is much more convincing. The plumage is there not because it’s a signal of health, but because the females like it. Read this book. Especially the penis parts "
1,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32647049-jennifer-insert-lit-pun,0,"This is SUCH a great book. It made me do that annoying nonfiction reader thing where I was constantly telling my beleaguered family members all the cool facts I was learning. I'll be including more thoughts on it in a video, probably near the start of the year."
2,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"I am a little conflicted about this book.Popular science books may be usefully divided into those with One Big Idea, and those with Many Small Ideas. Both are useful, but I typically judge them differently. If it's a ""Many Small Ideas"" book (e.g. a collection of essays), I am likely to judge it primarily on the writing style, as that is what is in common across the entire book (typically). Whereas, if it is a One Big Idea book, I am likely to judge it on the quality of that idea. Prum's writing style is, incidentally, very good.This book's One Big Idea is, by the author's own admission, not one that originated with him. That's ok, though, because it is true to say that it has been a controversial, often neglected, and sometimes nearly suppressed idea. It is, I think, both important and contains a great deal of truth. So, you would think I would like this book, and by and large that is the case, I do like it.However, I did get the impression at times, that Richard Prum was a little afraid to face the full implications of the idea he was writing about.The idea in question, as far as I know first publicly raised in a serious way by Charles Darwin, is that of sexual selection as a driver for evolution. That is, the idea that evolution is not only driven by survival of the fittest, but also by survival of the most attractive. This may not seem so revolutionary, but in many ways it is just as explosive as the idea that markets price things not only owing to their relative merit, but that prices are also driven by irrational exuberance and fiscal bubbles.Thus, for example, when looking at the extravagant plumage of the peacock, there are broadly speaking two theories:1) the peacock that is otherwise fittest, can afford to produce the most extravagant tail feathers, so really the female is selecting for good genes for acquiring food and avoiding predators, and fancy tail feathers is just how she measures that.2) the peahen just likes the peacock with the flashy feathers because she does, no real reason, but if she instead were to be the one peahen to pick the drab fellow who was a good father, her sons would never be able to reproduce, and thus peahens who go for impressive tail feathers get selected for because...well, no reason really. ""Beauty"". Not everything is about survival of the fittest. If you go for plain when the rest of your species does not, you will not have many grandkids.Prum does a pretty efficient job of demolishing hypothesis (1), which I think it is fair to say is the more broadly supported theory. He asks, if peacocks just have big tail to show off that they can survive even with such a handicap, why don't they gnaw one leg off? That would be an even more impressive display of handicapping, if you manage to continue to survive, but we don't see that in nature, and if we did peahens would not respond favorably to it. There are all kinds of things that could be handicaps, and therefore evidence of how great you are to survive with such a handicap: pulling your plumage out, injuring yourself, etc. etc. But, we don't see just any kind of handicaps working, it has to be the specific kind of handicap that females in that species like (in the case of peafowl, showy tail feathers).The problem with this is that, as with classical economics wanting to make everything about people optimizing for money, some evolutionary scientists want everything to be about natural selection (by survival of the fittest). Once you introduce a truly independent, second driver, you go from a linear system to a non-linear one, and you can get crazy results. Just as you can get economies stuck in sub-optimal states, or cycling through debt-fueled booms and busts, you could get species stuck in sub-optimal states, or cycling through long-term cycles of fashion in appearance and even courtship behavior, that don't particularly have anything to do with fitness.After having established that Darwin's more complex ideas on evolution (not shared by Wallace, by the way) were correct, though, Prum shies away from the harsher possibilities. For example, when we look at the impact of people buying homes, not to live in, but as something to sell again later, it is clear that it can drive your economy into some bad places. There is no particular reason (that Prum explains, anyway) why sexual selection could not have the same issues for a species.But, and here is my main issue with this book, Prum has conflated in his mind the idea that females of many species exercise choice, and the idea that human females should have choices in mate choice. He never says it so plainly, but you can get a clear sense in his writing that he just likes sexual selection better than conventionally understood natural selection, because it's about female choice and not about predation. I got the strong impression that he would have a visceral negative response to the idea that this could ever result in anything bad happening to the species, or that anything good could result for those species where females do not have as much choice.It seems a fairly good example of the problem with having academia that is so overwhelmingly from one part of the political spectrum. Just as Victorian biologists (aside from Darwin) choked on the idea that sex and female mate choice could be an important driver of evolution, so Prum appears to be choking on the idea that those species where female mate choice is the main driver of evolution, could ever have anything bad result from that.It doesn't have to be this way, not least because the way that human females choose their mates is not much like peahens; they often take into account aspects of the fellow's brain, such as personality and responsibility and whether he can hold down a good job. They don't all go for the fellow with the nice tail feathers (though of course some do). So, if mate choice as a driver of evolution is problematic for species fitness in, say, the Guianan Cock-of-the-Rock (a real bird species name, btw), that does not mean that female freedom of choice is not to be desired in humans. Because, while there are a lot of interesting parallels between birds and humans, there are also some nontrivial differences.More fundamentally, whether or not an idea is comforting or reassuring is not a proper factor in influencing whether we explore the possibility that it is true. Prum has obviously done a lot of good work in demonstrating that evolution, and mate choice, is not just about fitness, traditionally defined. The book is well written, with many beautiful pictures and drawings, and more than a few fascinating discussions of different species courtship and mating habits (the chapter on ducks was equally amusing and disturbing, for example). It gave me a lot to think about, and for that reason alone it is worth reading. Even if I have the sneaking suspicion that Richard Prum's opponents are not the only ones that are uncomfortable with the possible consequences of his ideas."
3,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1728330-carl-zimmer,5,"Over the years, I've interviewed Prum several times for various articles about birds--from the way some birds can sing with their wing feathers to the baroque sexual anatomy of ducks. In those interviews, the conversation would sometimes take us into short digressions about his big ideas about beauty. Finally, when Prum published this book, I could take them in as one long--and fascinating--argument. Here's the blurb I gave it:""Life isn't just a dreary slog of survival. It brims with exuberance--from extravagant plumage to strange courtship rituals. In The Evolution of Beauty, Richard Prum takes into this universe of delights to discover a fascinating idea: that beauty is central to the history of life."""
4,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,4,"Great until the last two chapters, then some slippageThis book is worth five stars for two starter reasons alone.One is the sheer depth and breadth of Prum's speculative intelligence, especially in getting back to what he rightly postulates was Darwin's original stance on sexual selection.The second is the number of swift kicks he rightly gives Ev Psychers.Beyond that, I think he's largely, and refreshingly, right on Darwin's take, and on how it plays out today with much more field studies not only in birds, which Darwin surely would have loved, but in other primates and ultimately in Homo sapiens.That said, even iat five stars, I can quibble.The last two chapters are speculative and the last is also somewhat politicized even beyond the intellectual judo on Ev Psychers.First, the chapter on same-sex relationships in humans, ironically, given the rest of Prum's book, comes close to making adaptationist claims, though Prum would deny it.Second, Prum ignores the broadness of same-sex relationships in other mammals and in birds, and acts almost as if it's de novo in humans, and of course he knows it's not.Third, he doesn't ask if ""gay"" relationships, whether in humans, or other animals, are more common than ""lesbian"" ones. (It seems to be the case in humans.)Nor does he ask if mammals', and especially humans', stumpy Y chromosome, along with womb environmental factors, doesn't contributed to gay sexuality being nonadaptive from a natural selection POV, but not so nonadaptive as to eliminate itself. (Given the reversed sex chromosomes in birds, lesbian sex studies there, especially of birds with the most decayed Y's, would be interesting indeed.)The last chapter? I agree to a fair degree with critiques — whether about patriarchy or private property — on the rise of agriculture, etc. But, the coevolution of cultural evolution and natural selection itself is speculative enough; cultural evolution and sexual selection even more so. Plus, the pre-agricultural world wasn't all that.All of this together? Sorry, but you lost a star."
5,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,5,"An excellent book seeking to revive Darwin’s hypothesis in 
Descent of Man
 that female sexual autonomy is an evolutionary force, occupying a separate sphere from that of adaptive mate choice. Darwin originally posited two aspects to his theory of sexual selection: first, that aggression evolved to increase the survival of contenders in male-to-male competition for mates, and secondly—perhaps more saliently—the female preference for beauty (“the taste for the beautiful”) drives aesthetic evolution in males. His theory was vehemently denounced by his contemporaries, in part because it was deeply at odds with the Victorian cultural milieu. One critic Mivart argued that animals lacked the cognitive capacity, free will, and sensory powers to make sexual decisions based on ornamentation. Underlying this was the implicit belief female choice could not drive such order and structure as the peacock’s tail, that female preference was far too fickle to have a concerted effect. Such detractors also felt that the mate choice theory of sexual selection was a dilution of Darwin’s comprehensive theory of evolution; thus, a stain on his legacy. He remained persuaded of his theory of sexual selection up until his death.In contradiction to the Wallacean adaptationist view of evolution—which holds the sexual ornaments evolved only as authentic indices of quality—the authentically Darwinian view accepts the contingent character of beauty. Beauty is not sought for its adaptive, utilitarian value, but as a value in and of itself.Many popular ideas are contested in this book. Despite widespread opinion to the contrary, females seem to not be attracted to extremely masculine traits. Instead, it is hypothesized that such hyper-masculine features arose due to male-to-male competition. Through female mate choice, men have actually evolved to social cooperation and reduced aggressiveness. Finally, the last chapter makes an intriguing connection between eugenics and the obsession with adaptive improvement, since eugenic social programs were explicitly anti-aesthetic. Aesthetic choice and adaptive mate choice are often opposed. Sexual autonomy drives the production of the beautiful, motivating aesthetic evolution via sexual selection."
6,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31289003-alexander,5,"It's often forgotten that Darwin was not, strictly speaking, the bloke who discovered evolution. What he did discover was arguably far more important: the mechanism through which evolution takes place - natural selection. It's natural selection which answers the 'how' of evolution, the means by which life 'descends with modification'. Or at least, that's the standard story generally told about Darwin's place in the evolutionary pantheon. What's even further forgotten in this already simplified tale is that Darwin didn't postulate just one, but in fact two mechanisms of evolution, the second being the selective pressure of mate choice, or rather, sexual selection. Not just survival, but the distinct ability to find and impress a mate stand guard at the doorway of evolutionary success. Natural selection and sexual selection, the twin pillars of evolutionary biology, the dual principles underlying the evolution of all life on Earth. Right? Well, depends on who you ask. Even from the get-go, the independent footing of sexual selection was never easily admitted, with Darwin's famous contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, dismissing sexual selection as a mere offshoot of the more primary mechanism of natural selection. Not only was the idea of animals making aesthetic choices - choices on the basis of beauty alone - deemed absurd, but granting that such choices had the power of shaping the biosphere was simply beyond the pale (especially given that, for the most part, these choices were made by - shock horror - females!). Such was the ferocity of these critiques that ever since, sexual selection has long lived in the half-light of natural selection, with mate choice largely understood to be, at best, a matter of selecting for the 'fittest' partner (with beauty being nothing other than a cipher or sign-post for fitness).Against such widely held 'sign-post' theories of sexual selection however, stands Richard Prum's The Evolution of Beauty, which aims to do nothing less than reinstate the rank of sexual selection to its original place as a fully-fledged mechanism of evolution in its own right. More than just an academic reminder to 'get Darwin right' though, Prum, a Yale ornithologist, marshals evidence from all across the avian world - from the nests of Bowerbirds to the sexual anatomy of Ducks, the tail feathers of the Great Argus to the 'dances' of Manakin birds - to establish once and for all the irreducible role of beauty as a driver of evolution. So much so in fact, that, contrary to 'adaptationist' approaches in which evolution can only ever be steered by increasing chances of survival, sexual selection can and in fact has, worked against natural selection, making animals less fit, or rather less-than-optimal when it comes to survival.Such are the stakes involved here, which, more than just being another pleasing tale of the evolution of 'this' or 'that', aim to rebound upon our very understanding of what evolution really is, and how, exactly, it really works. While I've skipped over a great deal of the book's nitty gritty, trust me when I say that Prum is a storyteller of almost magical ability, weaving personal anecdote with the scientific cutting-edge, a love of birds with a love of science, all of which make for a read as gorgeously written as it is intellectually mind-opening. While some have quibbled with Prum's disciplinary polemics and (liberal) politics, both pinned fairly prominently throughout the book, in truth, I have nothing but admiration for Prum's resolute affirmation of - wait for it - the feminist implications of his research (in nuce: sexual selection means that female choice matters: female autonomy literally shapes life), along with the 'post-human aesthetic philosophy' upon which he calls to be incipit in its wake. A marvellous, paradigm altering book."
7,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59054793-tom,2,"this book is a mess. there seems to today exist an opinion among publishers that the general public are not interested in 'popular science' books without some kind of edge. every theory discussed must be groundbreaking, or controversial, or newly rediscovered (with a third of the book being about the scandalous tale of why it was ignored for so long in the first place!). when authors yield and try better fit these desirable narratives the content always suffers. the evolution of beauty reads at certain points as though it has undergone a hack and slash rewrite, perhaps starting life as a manuscript about aesthetic innovation in birds that made few bold claims. despite some interesting content and decent writing (prum's lifelong obsession with and passion for birds shines through) this book is ultimately is an unfortunate casualty of publisher demands for sexier science. even the title is misleading in two regards; this is not really a book totally about the evolution of beauty, and sexual selection has certainly not been ""forgotten"" in the scientific community.the science suffers. examining sexual selection and mate choice as processes distinct from natural selection doesn't make sense for any reason other than to further some of his arguments. the chapter about human sexuality grabs attention but is genuinely ridiculous in places. his proposed explanation for the evolution of the female orgasm could not possibly be selected for!bad science aside, prum is also guilty of what i can only term ""social-justice washing"". he makes the bizarre claim that his theory of aesthetic evolution disproves eugenics(?) and that it supports feminism as a sort of natural cultural tool. such appeals to nature are downright dangerous and extremely irresponsible for a man of his position to make. progressive social movements can just as easily be attacked by opponents with references to biology. it is a cynical move by an author who desires to seem socially aware which inadvertently shows his disregard.the chapter about forced copulation in waterfowl and the three chapters about manikins were genuinely extremely good tho. two stars."
8,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"This book's title *and* subtitle are not enticing enough. It should simply be called ""Sextastic Sexiness Sexplains Everything (Not Just Sex)."" Not only would it sum up the main point of the book, but it also explains why it's as much a page-turner as it is a head-scratcher, and not (just) a confounding recap of whenever you first learned about evolution by natural selection.Speaking of recap, a quick recap: most of the features we see in living things today we try to explain via natural selection, e.g. if a bunch of animals have big noses, it's probably because big noses allowed the ancestors of that bunch of animals to have more kids than their peers who had smaller noses. Maybe big noses let them find food more efficiently, and the small noses starved to death before they could have many kids. This was the key insight of a dude named Charles Darwin. It revolutionized all of biology, and today we generally call this kind of thinking Darwinism.BUT, Darwin had another great idea to explain why organisms change over the generations and why we see so much diversity today. If animals have sex, and can choose who they have sex with, their own preferences could drive change. Maybe big noses don't help with finding food at all, but ladies love them, so guys with big noses have more sex with more partners and have more kids, while the poor small noses get bred out of existence.It sounds kind of simple, but one of Prum's main arguments in this book is that it is anything but simple, and anything but accepted in evolutionary biology, and he goes so far as to suggest that it has affected everything from feminism to human penis size to art. I'm guessing at least one of those things is of interest to almost every human, and thus I suggest that you will probably find this book as interesting as I did.I, of course, had some problems, because problems are just the kinds of things I have.1) Way too obsessed with Darwin. Chuck was a great guy, don't get me wrong, but Prum's repeated insistence that we be ""authentically Darwinian"" began to sound like idolization after a while. Just because Darwin thought something was true doesn't prove it true. Experimentation proves things are true. Usually. I understand the desire to reclaim the meaning of the word ""Darwinian,"" but I think it was a bit overplayed2) Not everyone has sex. This book convinced me of the importance of mate choice... in organisms that mate and can perceive and choose mates, which kind of ignores all plants, fungi, bacteria, asexual animals, etc., so is mate choice really that fundamental a part of evolution? Adaptation doesn't explain everything, as Prum argues again and again here, and I was actually on board with that before even starting (since reading Gould and Lewontin's Spandrels of San Marco in college), but I also agree with Daniel Dennett that adaption is probably the strongest and most common evolutionary force, and it's hard to overlook the fact that mate choice doesn't seem possible for the vast majority of the Tree of Life. That said, plants and fungi *do* mate, and even some bacteria and archaea engage in lateral gene transfer. If Prum could have shown that some of these organisms have preferences and that those preferences seem arbitrary that would have been amazing.3) Why is mate choice a better null model than adaptation? Totally agree that a null model should be falsifiable, but wouldn't the best null model always be that nothing special is happening and a trait arose by chance, e.g. there used to be folks with small noses but it just so happened almost all of them got killed in an avalanche?4) Human stuff: this is where Prum gets super speculative. It's fascinating and a great call to action for future research, but I feel like evolutionary theories about anything human are always hampered by the fact that we only have one species of human to look at and the fossil record can only tell us so much. It's not like manakins and bowerbirds where we have dozens to compare and make trees with. Even if you expand your thinking to the great apes as Prum does, you only get four more data points. This kind of makes arguments like the one about testicle size decreasing in the human lineage because of decreased need for sperm competition ring a bit hollow. I mean, maybe? Comparing testicle size and mating behavior among the other great apes is interesting but... there are so few of them. If there were 50 great apes, it would be a stronger argument.5) Liberal bias. I suspect I'm about as politically liberal as Prum is, but a lot of the stuff about feminism, art, and homosexuality had my too-good-to-be-true alarms going off. The chapter about duck sex was dark, super dark, like rape as a species-defining act dark, and I feel like Prum eschewed some of the maladaptive potential of toxic masculinity in humans in an effort to look on the bright side in the absence of the kind of great data he and his colleagues collected about ducks. But who knows, maybe future research will support him. I hope it does.P.S. Did I mention there are a lot of awesome facts about birds in here? I didn't? There are. If you like facts and you like birds, you will like this book. If you like ducks and want to continue liking ducks, though, maybe give it a pass."
9,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock,3,Interesting. Very clinical. If you're a fan of Darwinian theory this is for you. If you're not you'll hate it. 
10,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,5,"The Evolution of Beauty is utterly fascinating. It puts forth the notion that evolution is not all due to natural selection, where every mating display is an honest signal of genetic superiority. Rather, there is a separate force at work--aesthetic evolution of mate choice--which created a lot of the ornaments and behaviors we see in the animal world today.Prum makes his arguments via interesting narratives about birds, ducks, and humans. I found it useful to look up bird displays as he talks about them so I can see and hear for myself the complex shows that they put on. Going in, I thought I would be learning about an abstract concept, so I was surprised by how much of what I'm reading applies to our lives today, including sexual coercion, females' right to make reproductive choices, and sexual conflict between the sexes.For such a technical topic, I found the book mostly readable and digestible. The initial two chapters were a bit slow as Prum talks about the history of evolutionary science and puts forth his views. But if you can tough it out through those, then you get to the meat of it with chapter three, and it's completely mesmerizing from there on out."
11,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11725250-arthur,2,"The book's main thesis is interesting and well-supported by the author - that aesthetic mate choice is an evolutionary force which forms the features of many animals. Thus, a male pheasant's tail feathers coevolve with the female pheasant's aesthetic preference for these feathers. This is a very interesting idea which is not well popularized and the author does it justice. The book, however, veers off point in the discussions. The author is an active birdwatcher and fills the pages with minute descriptions of birds which he finds fascinating. Now, I like to think of myself as interested in biology and in general curious of descriptions of animal behaviours, however, when I am exposed to multiple consecutive chapters on how exactly birds wiggle their tails or gather their sticks to make their nests, unfortunately I end up tuning out. It's just really boring to read, though it does support the author's hypothesis. What bugs me the most about the book, however, is that the author's overall life perspective and moral philosophies constantly leak into his scientific discussions. The author seems to unselfconsciously believe that the entire natural universe conforms to his inherent social convictions. Thus, he sees feminism in birds, feels that human sexual evolution is largely a story of female sexual autonomy, and bends over backwards to ensure that homosexuals are ""completely equal"" in personality even when his own theory predicts that they have been selected for the specific nonviolent (and again, feminist) trait of decreased male-on-female sexual violence. It is hard to imagine a more politically correct treatise at all - when describing the various complexities of nature he nearly never counters any prevalent liberal social ideas. No wonder this book nearly won the Pulitzer Prize - when it confirms nearly every belief of the generic modern reader, of course the readership will love it. At some points, however, and especially in the culminating chapters describing human evolution, his desire to fit reality to his own views gets downright ridiculous. Very often he contradicts himself, if not on consecutive paragraphs, then on consecutive pages. For example, on one page he describes how homosexuality is strongly hereditary, on another he can't resist, out of the blue and off-topic, spending multiple paragraphs arguing that there is no such thing as a gay gene. When describing female orgasm, he again works himself into exclusively politically correct straits. He had spent most of the book describing how one sex can select for complex traits to emerge in another purely through aesthetic choice, yet when it comes to describing the origin of the mysterious female orgasm he cannot bring himself to suggest that female orgasm might exist because males enjoy it. He also cannot bring himself to believe that it can be a vestigial artifact of the male orgasm, though he had described at least two examples of similarly vestigial gendered artifacts in birds elsewhere in the book - a thickened wing bone and feather-free head patch. But no, instead of considering the possibility that the female orgasm can be at all beholden to the male's, he bends over backwards to describe an entirely new ""Pleasure Happens"" hypothesis (capitalized for effect!), specially crafted for the occasion, whereby females have independently evolved the orgasm for themselves purely for self enjoyment. Checkmate! Female autonomy wins again. However, I wish I could ask him directly - if there exists such a convenient mechanism for animals to evolve their own happiness, then why haven't humans, and animals in general, evolved a way to just stimulate our own bliss across the board? Now, I don't claim to know the answer to either the origins of the female orgasm, or of homosexuality. However, when en masse we see that his body of argumentation consistently and emotionally guides itself into politically correct, socially appropriate, entirely wonderful and feminist conclusions, it just leads one to very strongly believe that the author is consistently misleading himself and his readers via his own personal biases and preferences. Unfortunately, however, nature is not subject to Prim's well-intentioned feelings, and therefore I can't recommend this book."
12,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,3,"The topic is fascinating and Prum's argument is intriguing (challenging the mainstream evolutionary dogma that has existed since Darwin), but it gradually grew repetitive as he goes down each successive rabbit-hole example. After 100 pages, his argument was made, but it just kept going over additional territory to demonstrate the same point. It became a chore to finish the second half."
13,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,3,"I had on odd experience with this book, because the author annoys me in a number of ways, but I think his core thesis is probably correct. The book changed my thinking on the major issue of aesthetic selection, yet I also felt large sections were much weaker.One of my least favorite things is how the author seems to invest a large amount of moral weight to this issue - I think it's unhelpful and leads to strange double standards. For example, he repeatedly condemns the sexual arms race in ducks as wasteful, yet doesn't seem to consider beauty arms races in the same way. I can't help but note that bowerbirds only live on a few islands, while ducks are pretty much everywhere.After puncturing evolutionary psychology with some strong evidence, the author then goes on to... pretty much do the same thing. Many of the final arguments struck me as nearly pure speculation, often even adaptionist in the way he criticizes others.On a more minor note, there's a huge amount of bird stuff in this book: descriptions of birds, narrated bird behavior, asides about birding, etc. Someone who cares more about birds would probably get more out of it, but for me it felt entirely aside from the theory that interested me. The culmination was a section where the author breathlessly goes through an extended story about how his research took him to a shocking discovery: two closely-related birds were in fact slightly more closely related than previously believed.All told, I think the book is on the correct side of the scientific argument, but it doesn't do the best job of supporting that argument."
14,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68748774-lauren-dandridge,2,"I was given this as a gift and was excited to read it, but it definitely didn’t live up to what I was hoping for. At the end of the day, I think the author’s underlying theory is wrong. He’s obviously a smart guy who knows a lot about both evolution and birds, but it seems to me that he’s trying to paint a picture of this huge landmark theory that doesn’t really hold any water. He seems to answer most of his own questions without acknowledging that the “super deep insightful questions” he’s asking already have scientifically sound answers that he glosses over. I slogged through it because the writing was decent and there was some interesting stuff, but I’m just not buying his main point. And for the love of god please put in text footnotes or endnotes instead of just a page number referenced list at the end of the book!"
15,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Usually when a popular science book is hailed as “breakthrough” or “revolutionary” I find that either it’s only novel because it makes absolutely no sense (e.g Antonio Damasio’s latest, “The Strange Order of Things) or it’s an old concept that is just being expressed compellingly for the first time. This book was totally an exception. The central premise is novel (to my knowledge), has predictive power, is testable, and written compellingly. I took several classes on evolutionary theory in college, and in my personal experience, he’s right that the theory of sexual selection he’s talking about was not taught to me and was in fact, ignored in favor of adaptive theories of sexual selection (which never really seemed that parsimonious to me).“In a curious anthropomorphic inversion of nature, animal passions are now seen as more rational than our own.”The central idea of the book is that sexual selection based on arbitrary (non-adaptive) features is a driver of evolutionary change independent of adaptive natural selection. The proposed mechanism is that if an organism has a preference for an arbitrary trait, and mates selectively with an organism that has that trait, their offspring will have not only that trait, but also a preference for that trait. In that way, you get a “runaway co-evolution” of the trait and the preference for that trait. I think that’s super interesting. The book is structured in my favorite way for popular science books: a plethora of careful observations (data), a presentation of possible explanations, then the evidence that one particular model (his “beauty happens” hypothesis) fits the available data the best, followed by a plausible mechanism. I had a few superficial problems with the book. For example, he’s really bent on what being a true “Darwinian” means. In my mind, who cares? Darwin had some good ideas, and some not so good ideas, like every scientist ever. I don’t need to be married to all his ideas because I like the idea of natural selection. Also, he spends a really long time on some topics and not so long on others, and it doesn’t seem to be based on where there is the most evidence or interesting information, but just what caught his fancy at the time. Whatever, that’s his prerogative as a writer. While some parts were less interesting to me than they were to him, overall the book was balanced, well written and super interesting and thought-provoking. I was left thinking, why did preferences for arbitrary traits evolve in the first place? I thought perhaps as a selective attention mechanism. As in, it was adaptive to pay closer attention to only a subset of available mates instead of spreading attention too thinly across all potential mates. In that case, you would expect a preference for arbitrary traits to be more concentrated in species that have historically had a great surplus of available mates presented simultaneously over species that only run into a potential mate like once in a blue moon. I’m not sure if that’s true, but I think it’s an interesting question. Bottom line, would recommend, good popular science book."
16,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77925-cat,4,"Really a 4.5 SO many interesting facts, thoughts, perspectives all wrapped up in very good and enjoyable writing - and it is about birding and sexual evolution! WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR?! This book sits so squarely in the center of some of my biggest interests, birds and birding, aesthetic evolution (which I only just learned the name of), Darwinian theory, female sexuality, same sex desire, and an understanding of patriarchy and male violence ( of which, by the way, the author concludes, ""Despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, this view implies that patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ""destiny"" (whatever that is).""). YOU ALL. It's like this book was written to be read by me. The author posits, ""In many ways, Darwin's idea that the aesthetic evaluations involved in mate choice among animals constitute an independent evolutionary force in nature as radical today as it was when he proposed it nearly 150 years ago. Darwin discovered that evolution is not merely about the survival of the fittest but also about charm and sensory delight in individual subjective experience. The implications of this idea for scientists and observers of nature are profound, requiring us to acknowledge that the dawn bird song chorus, the cooperative group displays of the blue Chiroxiphia manakins, the spectacular plumage of the male Great Argus Pheasant, and many other wondrous sights and sounds of the natural world are not merely delightful to us; they are products of a long history of subjective evaluations made by the animals themselves."" Because, of course they are! How much more sense does this supposition make than the commonly accepted, but limiting concept of evolution only as a continual natural selection of the fittest. As soon as I started to understand this premise (the author does a great job of walking us through LOTS of bird information to help us get here), it just clicked for so much of what I understand and believe of the world that is far less about biological imperative and far more about 'beauty' of all sorts when it comes to sexuality and mate selection. This was such an amazing thing to add to my consideration of the overall natural world - for birds and for us humans!As the author says at the conclusion, ""I realized along the way that bird-watching and science are both ways of exploring yourself in the world - parallel paths to find self-expression and meaning through engagement with the diversity and complexity of the natural world around us."" Yes, please to more of all of it and to Richard Prum for helping to introduce complex scientific theories in ways that FEEL like engagement with the diversity and complexity of the natural world. This book delighted me in so many ways - not the least of which is the ways that the world opens up to us humans through the careful contemplation of birds. #BirdNerd4LifeBook 9 of 2020"
17,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,4,"Rated one of the top 10 Best Books of 2017 by the NYT, this is truly a really good read. The author, Richard Prum has an infectious passion for ornithology and it's easy to get caught up in the magic. For example, are you aware that when a birder identifies a bird in the wild (ie. anywhere outdoors), she uses the same parts of the brain that other people use to recognize familiar faces such as Abraham Lincoln, Jennifer Anniston and/or your aunt? And there are birds that look grey and black and brown until it's time to impress their ladybird friends----only then do the colors come out in magnificent plumage of a sophisticated pattern of a golden Persian carpet. Then there's duck rape and homosexual behavior in birds, and all kinds of things that can't be explained by our current understanding of evolution. This is a good place for a mind-opening experience. "
18,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,2,"My takeaway from this book - if you believe what most evolutionary biologists believe rather than Prum's flavor of mate selection you are a sexist eugenicist (basically a nazi) forcing a square peg into a round hole and, worst of all, an apostate opposed to Darwin himself! I often find this sort of ""everyone's out to get me"" narrative, and it just comes off as desperate and defensive - all it serves to do is put my on notice that I should be deeply skeptical of what this person is about to say, because evidently their arguments don't stand on their own.I don't know this field well enough to know if Prum is also constructing a straw-man of his intellectual opponents (though I wouldn't be surprised), but if it's true that evolutionary biologists believe there's nothing arbitrary co-evolved features, then I'm at least on his side about that. I can even imagine there are a lot of non-equilibrium or partial-equilibrium dynamics (metastable evolutionary states, for example) at play that could give rise to inherited aesthetic preferences in direct contradiction to the fitness function, but Prum does not explore this at all, he just mentions a Fisher model of aesthetic preferences and asserts without real proof that this is the ""null hypothesis"" for some reason, then carps on about that for the rest of the book. I'd very much like to read a version of this book that is not quite so adversarial and reconciles the obvious problems with an ""arbitrary aesthetic preferences"" model for highly conserved features that are also greatly deliterious to organism survival that the costly signal mechanism is intended to explain.Regarding Prum's idea that the ""beauty happens"" model is the null hypothesis (or, as he calls it, the ""beauty happens null model"", as if repeating it over and over again will somehow make it true), I think he's somewhat hijacking this idea (in the same way that he accuses his opponents of hijacking it for their own purposes) to try and get his idea set as the ""default"" so that it can be asserted without proof. But in fact, the ""default"" model is we don't know why. There's evidence (as I alluded to above) that costly signals exist in other evolutionary and strategic systems, there's also obviously evidence that aesthetic preferences exist (and there's also reason to believe that they must at least occasionally be arbitrary in at least some non-equilibrium situations). If there's nothing to differentiate between them, you don't just say ""Well, this one is the default"", you say, ""It could be either of these things, if we want to know which one, we'll need to propose some mechanism to distinguish between them.""The reason this is a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review is because there actually does seem to be a good amount of likely factual information in the book in between Prum's bouts of sophistry. Some of the mate selection stuff he provides seems reasonably plausible (particularly when it seems closer to mainstream opinions about things like sexual dynamics), but I'd actually need a well-reasoned and neutral perspective on the topic just because I feel I can't trust most of what Prum says."
19,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"There is good reason to believe that many physical forms and behaviors relating to mating are not adaptive in the sense of promoting the survival and proliferation of a species. And the Zahavi theory that obviously non-adaptive features, like the peacock's tail, are developed as handicaps to adverstise that potential mates are so strong that they can fight with a hand tied behind their backs, always struck me as just plain dumb. This is the first book that I have read that proposes aesthetic mate choice as the driving force behind these seemingly non-adaptive forms, and I think that it makes a lot of sense. Prum says that Darwin advanced this theory of sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and maybe he did, but I have not read The Descent of Man, so I can't say whether this was really Darwin's theory or if Prum just wants to cloak himself with authority by appealing to the master. In any case, the idea is an interesting one, and it becomes particularly interesting in some of Prum's suggestions that sexual selection driven by aesthetic mate choice could work synchronously with natural selection in the development of things as important as feathers that could be used for flight (and not just thermal regulation) and in the development of less aggressive behavior in human males that may have facilitated the rise of human civilization. He offers no compelling evidence to back up these speculations but they certainly suggest interesting and possibly productive paths for future research. I enjoyed Prum's pokes at evolutionary psychology where he says that many of the practitioners seem to have a need to tell evolutionary ""Just So"" stories to justify every aspect of human sexuality as being explainable as adaptations driven by natural selection, even when the fit seems weak. This was exactly my reaction to my first exposure to evolutionary psychology in the book ""Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters,"" which caused me to see evolutionary psychology as a good idea that is being pushed too far.The place were I parted ways with Prum was at the very end of the book where he suggests that his theories of sexual selection are consistent with queer theory and modern ideas of gender fluidity. I have a lot of sympathy with his political leanings, but I think that in the end it is dangerous to try to use evolutionary science to support social and political ideas, even ones that I support. It is just the flip side of the fortunately discredited ideas of eugenics and Social Darwinism, no better when we do it than when they do it. I don't think that we can or should stick our heads in the sand and try to build an unbreachable Chinese Wall between evolutionary science and social movements, but we need to be super careful about this because it is area that is ripe for abuse whether it is being used by the left or the right."
20,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,2,"I'm about a quarter of the way in, and I've liked his argument and some of the anecdotes. Skimming ahead, it looks like a lot of reiteration coming up, plus more bird stories. He writes well, but I just don't care that much about the mainstream view vs. Prum's revival of Darwin's female choice in mating. Likely the truth lies somewhere between the two views. 2.5 stars, maybe.The book is coming due at the library, and I doubt I'll return to it. Caveat lector.Here's a good critical review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And here's the review that led me to read it:https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-only...""Richard Prum’s “The Evolution of Beauty” is a book to wrestle with. It includes plenty of well-wrought scenes—tales from the author’s boyhood birdwatching days, or the story of his lab getting pilloried on Fox News for a $385,000 study on duck genitalia. But above all it focuses on one idea: that beauty drives much of evolution. And even when the details aren’t quite convincing, the argument is exhilarating."""
21,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5143629-lindsey,5,"Animal behavior, sexual evolution, and feminism. ""This book has taken the concept of beauty from the humanities and applied it to the sciences by defining beauty as the result of a coevolutionary dance between desire and display."" In the concluding chapter of his book, this sentence beautifully sums up the educational journey Richard O. Prum has just taken the reader on. Animal behavior/behavioral evolution is my absolute favorite area of study, one which I have had a miniscule access to since graduating college. This book (and the renowned scientist who authors it) draws incredible connections using scientific studies between current ideas of animal (and human) behavior, the origins of these ideas, and where (due to largely human bias) they quite possibly have been going wrong. He uses both his own studies and those of well-established/respected peers to take another look at Darwin's second idea, an idea as Prum coins it ""aesthetic beauty."" Beauty for the sake of beauty or, more scientifically, beauty which serves not to benefit genetics and ability of a species to survive/reproduce, but because Beauty Happens and is selected for (often by the female of the species) not necessarily because it conveys anything important but because it tagged along with other indicative traits and ended up being favored by the choosing sex (again, often females). Prum doesn't simply stop there, but goes on to suggest that Beauty Happens often because of inherent female sexual autonomy and links this to human concepts of feminism and our own ideas of sexual autonomy as the human species. I can't remember the last time I was so thrilled by an academic texts. I was genuinely excited by this book with every turn of the page and highly recommend to lovers of behavioral science, feminism, and anyone who jist wants to know why daddy duck really abandons mommy after she lays her eggs."
22,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"I randomly picked up Prum's The Evolution of Beauty among many books about evolution; it turns out to be extremely intriguing. With my smattering knowledge about biology, whenever I see an animal behavior, I regard it as a ""design"" to attain adaptive advantage. Male birds' ornamental feathers and melodic songs cannot attract females for no reason; they must be informative of health, vigor, fertility, what have you. If beauty is not a direct indicator of fitness, such as in the case of a peacock's tail, it must be a signaling device, a burden intentionally carried as credible proof of good genes. I am not alone in following this line of thinking: according to Prum, it is also the instinct of many biologists (his critics do not agree).But it is wrong! Beauty could be the result of the Fisherian runaway process, the genetic coevolution between (female) subjective preference and (male) ornamental display. Beauty could just ""happen"", without indicating survival or fecundity benefits. Prum argues the Fisherian process, instead of adaptive mate choice, should be the general explanation for display and aesthetics. As an ornithologist, he supports his view by graceful descriptions of great Argus pheasants, manakins, bower birds, and ducks. I find this ""beauty happens"" explanation inspirational because it offers me a brand new perspective to view the world. It also reminds me not to see the world through the lens of a single theory, a mistake often committed by economists. Prum's following analogy between evolutionary biology and economics is sobering:To many economists, the mere existence of an asset at a given price indicates that its price must accurately reflect its value. That’s very similar to arguing that the existence of a given tree or bird in a certain environment demonstrates that it must have achieved an optimal solution to the challenge of survival because it has not yet been displaced by some other ecological competitor. Both use their views to interpret the world in a way that reinforces those views.The second half of the book is about human. As the author admits, most of it is speculative and in need of research evidence. Although less rigorous than the first half, it is still fun to read. For example, when I learned from an open course that canine reduction is one of the two major differences between human and apes, I wondered why a change in two teeth could be as ""major"" as bipedality. But Prum offers a perspective: canine reduction, possibly resulted from female struggle for freedom in mate choice, could lead to less violence and more cooperation among human. As much as I like this book, however, I have to admit Prum does not tell the whole story. This professional review (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/e... ) points out the Fisherian process is not a powerful general explanation for beauty as Prum claims. There are many alternative mechanisms he fails to mention. Moreover, the Fisherian process works only under certain circumstances (for example, when it is not too costly to be choosy). Stray observations: 	• It occurs to me the ""beauty happens"" theory echoes with a view in art philosophy: beauty is not a means to an end, but rather an end in itself.	• I agree with the author that the relationship between female mate choice and beauty supports feminism: free choice without coercion results in beauty.	• Published in 1975, Zahavi’s handicap principle is essentially the same as Spence's signalling thoery (1973), but far less rigorous. It was not until 1990 when biologists developed a similar mathematical theory (Grafen, 1990)"
23,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5536017-david-cooke,5,"A 4.5 I'm rounding up. The first two thirds of the book are really fascinating and informative, and it sets up the final, more ambitious third well. But it's that last chunk on human behavior that is both the most challenging for the reader and the most speculative, so while it's interesting, it also feels like it really stretches itself beyond the science to a strong degree, which causes the project itself to not quite be perfect. But it is definitely a captivating read.Prum does a really good job initially of dissecting the history of evolutionary science, and I enjoyed the stories of the scientists themselves and the rivalry and how it shapes the future of evolutionary biology. I also thought has description of the null hypothesis and the problem a poorly defined null hypothesis creates was well described - while I have the scientific background, it seemed well enough argued that non-scientists should be able to follow as well.It may be that my own scientific curiosity makes me rate the bird chapters very highly, but I thought Prum's description of different aspects of his and his collaborators' research was highly fascinating and also each offered a new dimension that fleshed his argument out further. The Kindle format wasn't great for integrating the pictures of the birds, but I did appreciate that the full color images were there.While Prum tries to set up the last third with its own mini introduction about the failures/limitations of evolutionary psychology (which is done fairly well), the last third in primates and humans doesn't stick the landing for me quite as strongly as the bird science because even he admits it is so speculative and very difficult to even test. So, while Prum has some super interesting theories about human sexual evolution and how female mate choice and cultural elements may have played a role in human evolution, and those speculative theories are consistent with the earlier parts of the book, it is definitely putting him out on a limb with little truly hard/definitive evidence, so it's more like a fun parlor game than science. And it definitely made me squirm around the discussions of homosexuality in particular, which Prum acknowledges. And so, while he tries to constantly note the speculation, and while I appreciate especially the way in which he tries to not only distinguish it from eugenics but actually tries to show how it's a natural escape from such an awful philosophy, it's just a much more uncomfortable party of the book founded on a lot less sturdy a foundation, typical of late career scientists trying to broaden outside their career trajectory.That said, because Prum is constantly acknowledging the limitations of the evidence and his theories, and because the first part of the book are so thorough and interesting, I'm rounding up to 5 stars. Prum also does a good job of weaving personal narrative into the book to remind of the human aspect of science, which I also appreciate.Definitely would recommend to science nerds. I'd be real interested to hear queer, poc, and feminist perspectives on the last chunk of the book in particular...seems like there's a lot to unpack there, and I thought he did a reasonable job, but I'm also a white dude like the author and might be overlooking the same issues."
24,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32924510-anthony-matijas,5,"Prum clearly has a grudge against the field of evolutionary biology and its focus on Darwin's evolutionary principle of Survival of the Fittest at the expense of Darwin's lesser appreciated evolutionary principle of sexual selection. His arguments seem cogent, his evidence sound, but this a book written for the laymen, and as somebody who has only ever read one book on evolutionary biology (this one) it's hard for me to evaluate his argument without a better background in the field.That said, Prum is far more assertive in his critique of his colleagues than he is in putting forward his own theories. When he's speculating, he says so, when evidence is lacking to support his claims, he calls for more research. In other words he acts like a scientist.To the non-scientist, there is something very attractive in his idea that subjective mate choice is a far more significant driver of evolution than it is given credit for. From the peculiar mating rituals of the bird species he derives his own evolutionary expertise, he crafts a model for evolution that allows for competing drivers of evolutionary change. From strange world of duck sex, he posits an evolutionary battle of the sexes where male coercion must contend with female defensive strategies, and he demonstrates that the females are not always losing; that female agency and mate selection can have a profound impact not only upon how a species mates, but what kind of creatures will develop; how the behaviours of males can become less violent and coercive when females develop the capacity to choose with whom they mate. The social implications of his theory (which is really Darwin's theory, he'd be the first to admit), go beyond a genuinely objective feminist revision of evolution. The ideas of Social Darwinists and evolutionary psychologists who always seem to desire to reduce humanity to its basest urges and never identify with our highest virtues would have little to say if they proceeded from intellectually bankrupt assumptions.There is also something poetic in Prum's view of a aesthetic evolution. The idea that not only are humans not the only creatures to find beauty in one another, that in fact it is life's generalized appreciation for beauty which allows beauty to perpetuate and differentiate, and for life to multiply in both number and variety, is aesthetically pleasing in its own way.tldr: The book presents interesting ideas and is filled with intriguing facts about how animals all over this blue earth get together and make babies. It may be difficult to judge the veracity of his ideas to the laymen, but that is not a fault in the book, rather it's just a motivation to read more."
25,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2850772-laura-floyd,3,"I use my star system purely to rate my enjoyment of books, which puts this book in a bit of a tricky spot. I kind of enjoyed it, and sometimes it bored me greatly, and the repetitiveness that bored me also sometimes annoyed me, so... that puts it solidly in the so-so, two-star enjoyment category. But when this book was interesting, it was very interesting. I found myself recounting its premise and arguments to Dustin, who probably didn't even want to know. I still find myself thinking about some of the observations about human evolution and behavior days after finishing. Books that keep me thinking that long usually get at least four stars. So we'll settle on a sturdy halfway star rating, and now you know what to expect: a book that manages to be both fascinating and boring at the same time. I think the trouble is that Prum is an academic writing for a general audience. He's plenty clear, that's no problem. Unfortunately, he seems to lack confidence in his clarity. He keeps going over his points again and again. Perhaps if I came from an academic background that derided the evolutionary theory of mate selection, I would have needed seven chapters to be convinced, but it turns out that I always believed in the evolutionary theory of mate selection, without ever even knowing that was a thing. I've looked down at my breasts and wondered how the heck adaptive evolutionary theory could possibly explain them - animals don't cart these things around all year, and they seem to feed their young just fine. When Prum tells me Darwin had a second evolutionary theory to complement his theory of adaptive evolution, my reaction was not, as Prum seemed to expect, ""WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE YOU MUST BE WRONG ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION IS THE ONLY KIND OF EVOLUTION EXPLAIN YOURSELF!"" but, ""Oh, of course. That seems obvious."" Still, lots of interesting examples are provided in the midst of all his explaining and reexplaining. Do yourselves a favor and go look at some pictures of a great argus pheasant, which Prum claims (with good reason) puts the decorative plumage of the peacock to shame. Prum's poetic waxings about this bird were totally justified, and I'm glad I now know it exists. The final chapters about how the evolutionary theory of mate selection played into human evolution were fascinating, and while a lot of the ideas Prum puts forward here are rather speculative (by his own admission), they follow from the theories he spent the rest of the book laying out very nicely. The ideas about the evolutionary explanations of homosexuality were particularly interesting. Good for people interested in evolution, fancy birds, violent duck sex, and the origins of permanent human breasts. "
26,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,5,"Feminist evolutionary psychology. Take all the time you need with that one.The first half of the book is Prum talking about how neat he thinks birds are. It's roughly twice as boring as it sounds, but that's probably just because he didn't tell me anything new. Then, the second half of the book, he does what Darwin couldn't and goes, ""so here's how this applies to humans.""My new favorite theory on the development of homo sapiens rides Fisher's coattails with the aesthetic theory of evolution, which more or less boils down to ""female choice did it"". Everything that makes us not rapey baboons or infanticidal cannibal chimps comes out of mutual sexual selection, but female sexual selection played the larger role. This flies in the face of most established evolutionary psych, which has gone largely unchanged since the 50s when somebody cobbled together ""dudes like youth and beauty, chicks like resources and security"".First thing, they looked at duck genitalia. Ducks are a mess, man. Everyone knows about the corkscrew-penis thing, but it gets worse; duck vaginas are labyrinthine with all sorts of elaborate twists and turns and cul-de-sacs that evolved in this reproductive arms race wherein rapier ducks get bigger, more convoluted, occasionally toothed penises. Wackier still is, in areas where territory and mates are readily available, the annual regeneration of duck-penises (they grow them every mating season like lizard's tails) is unnecessary, and consensual duck mating foregoes the entire necessity of production of a bendy-straw duck penis. Ducks can mate either consensually or by ""sexual coercion"" (there is, unsurprisingly, controversy attached to the term ""duck rape""), with sexual coercion being the dominant strategy. If that were true of humans, as early evo-bio scientists and Hobbesian douchebags like to claim, there would likely be some vestigial traces of this left over in our hardware.It moved into primates after that, comparing us to the social disasters that are our closest relatives. Sexual dimorphism is a good indicator of the mating habits of a species. Generally, female animals that mate for protection or territory are significantly smaller than males, as is the case for most great apes. Male gorillas are almost twice the size of females, and gorillas tend to put together harems wherein several females offer sexual access to a single dominant male for protection and territory. Gorilla's penises and testicles are real tiny. This doesn't sound related, but is. Next up is chimpanzees, who are generally promiscuous, with females mating with multiple males during estrus. Dimorphism is mild, not nearly as extreme as in gorillas, with male chimpanzees averaging 10-30lb heavier than females. Chimpanzees have small penises and huge testicles. Enter homo sapiens. We don't know how the breeding is supposed to work, exactly, since we messed up the natural order with civilization, but there's no mistaking the hardware. Humans have colossal penises and testicles that fall in between gorilla and chimp sizes. For a long time, there was really no explaining the disparity, but my boy Prum steps up to the plate and offers to explain both this and humankind's constant, hidden fertility: aesthetic sexual selection, not only for genetic endowment, but also for enjoyment. Prum suggests that females selected more endowed/sexually capable males not based on a glance, but based on their performance, which could only be assessed once in flagrante delicto. Since odds of a successful conception on a one-time go around are so low for humans, due to the temperamental nature of their menstrual cycle and the fact that there are no obvious signs that a lady just hit peak fertility, the only way these traits could have been selected for is through repeat performances, which Prum terms ""remating"". So humans were likely promiscuous within the confines of their tribes, obviously needing to branch out to other tribes to discourage inbreeding, and if in a lady's sexploits she encountered a male who really knocked her socks off, she would keep mating with him until the seed took root.Not unlike modern dating, really.The book gets even more speculative from that point, suggesting that the reduction in length of human incisors resulted from females sexually selecting men who were less threatening and pushy, which is how the sexual coercion model fell out of favor among humans in the first place. This is a little too goal-oriented for me to fully believe, but the author clarifies that he's not saying this is concretely how it happened, just that this could be a way to explain it. Such is the problem with prescriptivism. It goes so far as to explain exclusive homosexuality in humans as a socially adaptive trait, getting away from the antiquated kin selection model and proposing that gay males forming protective but non-sexual friendships with straight females contributed even more to the collapse of the human sexual coercion model, and cited the absence of comparable cultural friendships among gay females and straight males (although this last bit is a touch too anecdotal for my tastes). What I found interesting was the suggestion that patriarchal cultures -- no, not the ""mean ol' media"" kind, the kind with genital mutilation -- tend to have strong taboos against female choice, female sexuality in general, and male homosexuality. I could talk about this shit forever, so let me try to wrap it up concisely. The take-home is that natural selection hasn't been calling the shots for homo sapiens a couple million years. It's all about sexual selection now, which necessitates an aesthetic evolutionary model, selecting for traits that we each find attractive. It's not just youth and resources, anymore. The hip-waist ratio might play a part, but not nearly as much of a part as it did a few hundred millennia ago. We select for traits we find most appealing (and by we I mean primarily chicks), and those are the traits that get passed on. If it weren't about beauty, if it were about pragmatism and monogamy, fruitful multiplication and defending the homestead, we would all look like elephant seals. Go ahead and google elephant seals, then google Christina Hendricks or Chris Hemsworth. Most importantly, this book and this theory suggest rape as aberrant, which is a long overdue evolutionary perspective. Our sexual dimorphism is down to around 14% size difference, which suggests that, while on average dudes will win the fistfight, a sufficiently motivated woman could still bring home the gold. That is just not something that happens among gorillas. Rape couldn't be a viable reproductive strategy for any number of reasons -- the pregnancy rate is too low, it's a pisspoor means of maintaining social standing, and you're not going to be selected for repeat performances, assuming your victim's family and/or gay best friend doesn't mount a counteroffensive and cave your skull in with a rock. All things considered, maybe humans aren't so bad, after all. "
27,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110830164-zhichao-guo,5,"A very thoroughly explained yet astonishingly long-ignored theory of sexual selection, in the view of aesthetic evolution, with decades of fascinating yet solid work about mate choice on birds. I'm convinced.For decades evolution by natural selection is known as ""survival of the fittest"", and when I get to learn more about evolution as a biology student, it was criticized and corrected by many evolutionary biologists to be ""reproduction of the fittest"", which tends to incorporate sexual selection as an innate part of natural selection. Adaptionist view of sexual selection has been so dominant that tens of different theories were proposed to explain the elaborate traits of male suitors. Two of my favorite quotes from the book:“Adaptive mate choice proposes that sexual desire always remains under strict control of the ultimately rational need for extrinsically better mates. In a curious anthropomorphic inversion of nature, animal passions are now seen as being more rational than our own.”“Desire for beauty will endure and undermine the desire for truth.”As discussed in the book, breakthroughs from behavioral economics showed that human decision makings are not so rational most of the time, if at all, then how can we assume that animals choose their mates with relentless calculation of their survival fitness, or their partner tastes are shaped by such survival pressure? Why aren't our irationality, our hopeless obsession with beauty and succombence to the pleasure it brings to us evolutionarily conserved? As a passionate birder and wildlife lover, I believe the ability to appreciate beauty empowered by sexual autonomy in females(mostly) , is the real drive for sexual selection.With that, welcome to the biggest fashion show on earth. Trends differ among species or populations as tastes differ, but ""desire for beauty"" endures."
28,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,5,"This book is a well-constructed and researched answer to anyone attempting to use evolutionary biology/psychology to justify their ""Red Pill"" philosophy. It is truly fantastic. What this book addresses is that a lot of Darwin's theories, as well as evolutionary biology in general, is not as straightforward as we try to make it. Birds evolve rather complex mating rituals that may pose some detrement, but leads to a continuation of the species. A lot more sexual selection is due to female choice rather than sexual selection. And beauty and pleasure just happen. A lot of what is beneficial to the passing on of genetic material may not arise from the act itself, but from the context surrounding it, such as having close social bonds maintained by sexual pleasure or by encouraging a less violent society by choosing less violent mates. This is a far different narrative than the male centric model that is often cited in popular culture, and that model keeps on being refuted time and time again. This book is funny and controversial. There is a chapter on the genital arms race of the duck, which has a penis that is ridiculous in length and evolved to deal with the labyrinthine duck vagina. We have a discussion on the female organism, which may not have much of an overt evolutionary advantage but is certainly not an afterthought. We have a discussion on the fluidity of sexuality, and a nice little aside about how we should stop trying to find biological reasons for cultural constructs. And there's so much more. I would say the first two chapters are the most boring, but the rest of the book is golden. "
29,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167181-boria-sax,3,"In The Evolution of Beauty, Richard Plum revives Darwin's theory of sexual selection, arguing that it is not reducible to natural selection. He argues that the exclusive emphasis on the more strictly pragmatic adaptation of organisms to their environment, at the expense of factors such as beauty, led, perhaps inevitably, to abuses such as racism and eugenics. He also argues that the human institution of patriarchy was, from the start, a reaction against the feminine autonomy. His arguments are clearly and judiciously presented. He is able to deal with potentially emotional subjects with both scientific objectivity and tact. I have only one caveat about this book, but it is a rather big one. The title is deceptive, since throughout the book he equates beauty with sexual attractiveness, and the two are very far from being the same. One may find a tree, a butterfly, or a stone to be beautiful, but that does not mean one is sexually attracted to them. One may be sexually aroused by pornography, but that does not make it beautiful. Contrary to what the author assumes, sexual attraction and beauty are essentially two different things, though they overlap. Though I support his call, articulated at the end of the book, for an aesthetic that embraces art created by people as well as the mating dances and songs of birds, his narrow conception of beauty does not allow him to lay the basis for one. I am intrigued by his discussion of why female birds find the songs of the male ones beautiful. But I would like even more to know just why we find these songs so lovely. After all, they were not sung for us."
30,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
31,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
32,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
33,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
34,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
35,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
36,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
37,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
38,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
39,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

41,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "

50,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

53,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
54,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
55,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
56,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
57,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with. It is is an evolutionary engine of beauty. sexual attraction: the object of desire (aka display traits) and the form of desire itself (aka mating preference)Null hypothesis: nothing special is happening. No specific, or special, explanation is required to account for the observation we made. It never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved. ""Cigarettes do not cause lung cancer"" is null hypothesis.

It is hypothesis that proposed, generalized causal mechanism is absent.

59,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
60,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
61,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
62,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
63,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
64,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
65,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
66,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
67,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
68,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
69,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."
70,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18282715-june,5,"Once pass the ornithological details (a bit tedious to non-bird-lover, but necessary for comparative studies and speculative conclusions drawn later on), the content, with its depth, breadth and impact, explode to everyone’s glory when read through.I’m still shaken by (awareness of) being transformed from Wallacean hedgehog(“on a mission”) to Darwinian fox (“play for the joy of it”)."
71,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "
72,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58082627-monika,5,"An enlightening, riveting and engaging book on sexual selection, written in a lively and very readable style. R. Prum meticulously reveals how female preferences resulted the appearance and behavior of males, so at this point Prum's book is filled with pretty provoking ideas, which I absolutely enjoyed. A fascinating read for understanding the evolution from a slightly different angle. "
73,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13009180-leslie-ann,5,"The book summary does a great job of describing the book, so I'll just add that Prum's stories are so engaging that I finished the audiobook very quickly.

74,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Enjoyed a lot, but I didn’t find it 100% convincing. Learned a lot of interesting stuff, though. I’m convinced that Darwinian sexual selection is important, and not merely as a proxy for fitness. But I’m not sure I’m ready to accept this as aesthetic selection either. Would like to read more about the topic. Prum is a good writer."

76,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65242654-daniel-hjelm,4,"I found this book very enriching to my understanding of evolution. Since I do not think any supernatural agencies are the originators of any of the species on this planet, darwin's evolution by natural selection has been my goto source to comprehend our origin.

80,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

83,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
84,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
85,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
86,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
87,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with.

89,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
90,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
91,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
92,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
93,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
94,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
95,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
96,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
97,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
98,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
99,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

101,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "
102,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58082627-monika,5,"An enlightening, riveting and engaging book on sexual selection, written in a lively and very readable style. R.

A fascinating read for understanding the evolution from a slightly different angle. "

110,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

113,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
114,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
115,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
116,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
117,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with.

119,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
120,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
121,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
122,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
123,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
124,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
125,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
126,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
127,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
128,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
129,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

131,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "

140,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

143,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
144,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
145,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
146,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
147,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with.

I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
150,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
151,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
152,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
153,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
154,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
155,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
156,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
157,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
158,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
159,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "

170,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

173,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
174,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
175,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
176,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
177,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with. It is is an evolutionary engine of beauty. sexual attraction: the object of desire (aka display traits) and the form of desire itself (aka mating preference)Null hypothesis: nothing special is happening. No specific, or special, explanation is required to account for the observation we made. It never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved. ""Cigarettes do not cause lung cancer"" is null hypothesis. Scientific burden of proof always lies with those who want to know that something specific is happening, not on those who think that is not. It is hypothesis that proposed, generalized causal mechanism is absent.

179,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
180,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
181,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
182,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
183,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
184,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
185,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
186,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
187,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "

"
189,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "

200,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

203,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
204,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
205,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
206,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
207,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with. It is is an evolutionary engine of beauty. sexual attraction: the object of desire (aka display traits) and the form of desire itself (aka mating preference)Null hypothesis: nothing special is happening. No specific, or special, explanation is required to account for the observation we made. It never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved. ""Cigarettes do not cause lung cancer"" is null hypothesis. Scientific burden of proof always lies with those who want to know that something specific is happening, not on those who think that is not. It is hypothesis that proposed, generalized causal mechanism is absent.

I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."

The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence.

Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
212,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
213,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
214,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
215,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
216,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
217,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
218,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
219,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

221,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "
222,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58082627-monika,5,"An enlightening, riveting and engaging book on sexual selection, written in a lively and very readable style. R.

230,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

233,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
234,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
235,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
236,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
237,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with. It is is an evolutionary engine of beauty. sexual attraction: the object of desire (aka display traits) and the form of desire itself (aka mating preference)Null hypothesis: nothing special is happening. No specific, or special, explanation is required to account for the observation we made. It never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved. ""Cigarettes do not cause lung cancer"" is null hypothesis.

It is hypothesis that proposed, generalized causal mechanism is absent.

239,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
240,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
241,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
242,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
243,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
244,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
245,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
246,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
247,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "

"
249,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."

I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "

260,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

263,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."

Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
265,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
266,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
267,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with.

269,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33663293-chad,4,"An impassioned, well-argued, and often laugh-out-loud funny challenge to the conventional view on natural selection's outsized role in evolutionary biology. I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
270,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"I actually stopped and started this book two times before I got to the good bits. The vast majority of this book is about birds, and I like birds, but I find reading about them a bit of a yawn. But the last part of the book, where he takes all the evolutionary arguments he's been making about beauty and birds and how lady birds who like pretty man-birds to mate with, drive evolution with their preferences, and then applies these findings to human sex, that part is really great. I'm going to admit here that I often feel deeply annoyed at evolutionary psychology, so part of why I like this book so much is that Prum uses evolutionary biology, and the idea the beauty happens (it doesn't honestly signal genetic superiority, we just like beauty, and choose it for it's own sake) to argue against most of the really annoying evolutionary psychology (and inevitably male-gaze-centric) arguments that I've heard. and Prum proposes some really interesting alternative theories based in far more compelling evidence. So Loved it, but you have to plow through a lot of bird stuff. "
271,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75902804-adam-cornish,4,"This is the first solid argument I've been presented for aesthetic selection as a component of evolution.Where the book went very right: describing the natural world and how sexual competition has had a strong impact on ornaments, behavior, and animal culture.Where the book went very wrong: being overly strident about how ""other"" evolutionary biologists have gotten it wrong, as well as the peppering in of slams against conservative politics.Maybe I'm biased, but I don't need moralizing or complaining in a book that focuses on the role of beauty in science. Build on the strengths, rather than bemoan the weaknesses.Overall, I still highly recommend this book, especially because of the duck sex. (totally read this book for the duck sex)"
272,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67226243-claret-press,5,"Who would have thought that a book on evolutionary biology would be so engaging. The thesis in a nutshell: Darwin was baffled by the peacock, whose tail was so stonking huge that it made it difficult for the bird to eat. This contradicted the basics of evolution: those who are most efficient and effective at finding food will flourish and those who are not, will wither away. The only explanation was that the female of the species rather fancied the beautiful tail, the bigger the better. Those birds with ludicrously gorgeously huge tails stood the best chance with the ladies. And so the species flourished. But this means that females get to choose. Choosing means that there is female autonomy and power. Turns out that Darwin, happily married, didn't have a problem with that but Darwinists did. The author revisits Darwin and reinserts women's decision-making back into evolutionary thinking. And about time too!"
273,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757957-liv,3,"I'm conflicted - there are a lot of really interesting ideas here, focusing on sexual selection as an evolutionary driver and not being necessarily tied to live/die/reproduce more/less genetic fitness. Relatively ""arbitrary"" aesthetics shaping mate choice, and thus phenotypes. Cool, cool, cool. Sexual autonomy, sexual pleasure as an evolutionary incentive, refreshing takes on human male sexuality (as in, hetero-men are actually pretty sexually picky compared to our closer relatives), right on, right on. A section on queer sexuality & its place in evolution that gets into subverting the patriarchy? Be still my heart. But then there are points where it's just reaching, and obvious ties to fitness are seemingly overlooked for convenience of the argument. There's a lot of pop-science based on one example study, without too much other backup, as well as speculation, and extrapolation that's pretty political (even if I agree with it, as Kueda mentions in another review... it smells a bit of ""too good to be true""). The odds of a trait having a neutral-fitness seem... pretty low to me? So even if there is aesthetic selection occurring, to write it ALL off as aesthetic selection, instead of a complex push-pull-chance of evolutionary forces seems a bit glib. It's got that ""here are the facts THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" feeling in many places."
274,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17326013-peggy-page,5,"Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing Prum present his ideas at the annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting. Why did it take me so long to get around to reading his book? I have always wondered why Darwin’s ideas of sexual selection as a force of evolution were not as widely embraced as adaptive natural selection, and long suspected a cultural bias against female agency. As a great exploration of the cultural history of a scientific idea, this book is well worth the read.But I loved it because I am a birder, and it gave me an even deeper appreciation of birds as active agents rather than the passive servants of adaptive selection. The bowerbirds are my favorite family, and some of the richest experiences in my life have been contemplating the wonder that is a bower! I spent hours watching a Satin Bowerbird in Australia arrange and rearrange blue bottle caps and berries until he had them just so, and marveled at the intricate architecture of the Great Bowerbird’s avenue bower. It is a pleasure to contemplate the intricate dance of female preference and male ingenuity that goes into these creations.And it is exhilarating to speculate that evolution serves the advancement of individual pleasure as well as species survival. Why must these be mutually exclusive? Darwin didn’t think they were."
275,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7204237-richard-gilbert,5,"Such an important book! For starters, it corrects about 150 years of reductive ""survival of the fittest"" thinking by evolutionary scientists and the public. This lopsided view flows from Charles Darwin's first book, On the Origin of Species, in 1859, and constitutes his first great idea.Afterward, Darwin theorized about the evolutionary effect of mate selection. He broached this notion in his second book. The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, in 1871. As Prum explains, Darwin's new insight started with the peacock’s tail. He famously told a friend that its feathers made him ill. Such an ornament simply could not be a mere billboard proclaiming fitness. Sure, the tail’s breadth, length, and heft indicate that the male bearing it must be a sturdy fellow. But look at the tail’s intricate, artistic, colorful design. Females had to select for that, Darwin realized.As Prum explains, Darwin’s fellow Victorian scientists, to a man, reacted with outrage. How could a peahen—or any other bird-brained female—drive evolution? Their unrelenting sexist campaign seriously damaged the spread and acceptance of Darwin’s second great theory.Evolutionary scientists since then have likewise rejected or minimized sexual selection’s role in shaping animals. The current reasons are less clear. Maybe we can intuit from one of their contemporary leading lights, the author of The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, who believes all human behavior flows unconsciously from programming aimed at furthering our own genetics. As if that isn’t dreary enough, Dawkins bruits his religion—a giddy militant atheism—far and wide. Dawkins and his ilk have inherited from Darwin’s Victorian gatekeepers a paradigm that explains everything. Case closed. Easy peasy. If they admit that creatures possess agency to shape themselves, where did that come from? Suddenly they’re cheek by jowl with poetry and religion, whose turf is . . . mystery.Prum builds his case bird by bird. Fascinating stuff—the plumage, displays, and temperaments that female birds have selected for. The males they’ve created boggle the mind. Like me, however, you may skim here. The payoff of Prum’s argument starts more than halfway through The Evolution of Beauty, as he teases out the implications of aesthetic evolution for our own species. In short, as with birds, men and women created each other—physically, intellectually, emotionally. The lion’s share of such selection, as it were, goes to the lioness, in Prum’s view.But if it’s true that our hominin foremothers began domesticating males millions of years ago— especially selecting for those who’d help rear children—and then handed the torch to Homo sapiens women 200,000 years ago, what has happened? How arose patriarchy and other forms of sexism, plus homophobia and oppressive totalitarian and reactionary politics? Prum’s answer: two cultural innovations, agriculture and the market economy that arose with it, some 15,000 years ago.It isn't clear how males got control, and Prum avoids speculating. I'd say that human ego, our clever, greedy species' blessing and curse, had something to do with it. Though all human genders have ego, it's more strongly installed in males. Or at least in some of them. Consider how few male despots it takes to skew a society. As the pharaohs did—harnessing human cooperation (labor) and transcendent yearnings (spirituality) for selfish ends.Sensing the sexual power of women—if not their dominant role in shaping men—no wonder patriarchal ideologies remain so focused on controlling female sexuality and reproduction and on condemning same-sex behaviors. But “patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny,’” Prum writes. “Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.”Culture of course can and does change—witness America’s social progress in the past 50 years alone. In part, Prum believes, such pushback for human rights represents the “emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy.” But he considers this conflict far from over:""The concept of an ongoing, culturally waged sexual conflict arms race also allows us to understand what is at stake in the battle between contemporary feminists and advocates of conservative, patriarchal views of human sexuality. After all, control over reproduction—including birth control and abortion—is at the very core of sexual conflict....""Like the evolved sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism is not an ideology of power or control over others; rather, it is an ideology of freedom of choice. This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual rights an especially frustrating quality.""...The centuries-long war on women—eloquently summarized by Eckhart Tolle in his religious synthesis A New Earth—along with literal wars and despots who usurp our species’ transcendent yearnings, are a global human tragedy. Prum both illuminates its causes and makes you feel that we’re not nearly at the end of our species’ story. This thrilling book is so very important. Offering a refreshing theory built from solid research and a mind unclouded by stale dogma, Prum shows humanity’s narrative arc bending toward cooperation and justice. Toward a sublime future."
276,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32459723-kate-lorraine,5,"I would never have predicted I'd find a book about theories of evolution written by an ornithologist to be interesting, but here we are. Prum has written a user-friendly scientific argument to bring back a second theory of Darwin's (one that runs parallel to his theory of natural selection) for serious consideration. He does an excellent job of explaining how Darwin's theory of aesthetic evolution has created a world full of such diversity and beauty. You'll have to read it yourself to find out why every chapter left me with Beyonce's ""Run the World"" stuck in my head."
277,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26038256-eric-eden,5,"Evolution explained well, even for the non-science reader. Prum makes a compelling case that evolution is not a simple question of adaption to the environment, but that in addition Darwin’s corollary idea is also true — that animals evolve for aesthetic reasons unrelated to survival of the fittest. So many fascinating insights — maybe the most interesting to me is the extent to which science is held hostage by cultural concerns (eg, patriarchal thinking). The best book I have read in a long while. "
278,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55634569-mousa-alshaikh,4,"This wonderful book turns standard evolutionary theory on its very head, and give very good insight on sexual selection in an enchanting, convincing, and fascinating manner.Purm re-utilizes Darwin's clarification of why certain features have neither rhyme nor reason, if survival is the main measure. "
279,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta,5,"Fascinating and fun, I can't say enough about this book. Prum demonstrates that Darwin himself believed that his theory of evolution didn't explain everything as he stated in a book called The Descent of Man, that pretty much outraged fellow scientists and then was forgotten. Why? Because he said that certain traits evolve simply because animals prefer them in a mate. Male birds have fancy feathers or a cool song because female birds dig it. Victorians were not ready to believe that females anywhere had sexual preferences and acted on them. Sadly those attitudes went through much of the last century- with Freud coining the phrase ""frigid"" for a woman disinterested in a virile male.This is an empowering book for women, because Prum clearly shows the difference in animal evolution in species where the female has agency, and species where the female is aggressively coerced. He argues that female freedom of choice influences evolution for the better.As a bonus, Prum has a sense of humor and is a wonderful story teller. His chapter on duck sex and bird penises (or lack of) may have been my favorite. This book looks rather dry, but I couldn't read it before bed time because my mind became so engaged."
280,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18282715-june,5,"Once pass the ornithological details (a bit tedious to non-bird-lover, but necessary for comparative studies and speculative conclusions drawn later on), the content, with its depth, breadth and impact, explode to everyone’s glory when read through.I’m still shaken by (awareness of) being transformed from Wallacean hedgehog(“on a mission”) to Darwinian fox (“play for the joy of it”)."
281,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129955-suju,4,"I had to leave this book and come back to it a few times because of scheduling issues, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. I rarely read such ""science-y"" books, but this one both doesn't talk down to the reader and is still understandable and entertaining. Essentially it posits that Darwin's theory of natural selection has erased one of his other theories about the evolution of beauty and the aesthetic (and sexual) choices birds, animals, and humans have made that contribute to who we - and other animals - are today. It's also a very feminist book, putting female sexual choices at the center of aesthetic evolution. A true pleasure to read. "
282,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58082627-monika,5,"An enlightening, riveting and engaging book on sexual selection, written in a lively and very readable style. R. Prum meticulously reveals how female preferences resulted the appearance and behavior of males, so at this point Prum's book is filled with pretty provoking ideas, which I absolutely enjoyed. A fascinating read for understanding the evolution from a slightly different angle. "
283,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13009180-leslie-ann,5,"The book summary does a great job of describing the book, so I'll just add that Prum's stories are so engaging that I finished the audiobook very quickly. I especially enjoyed learning how the timely topic of female sexual autonomy matters in nature, and am intrigued by the concept of developing methods to measure subjective concepts like beauty."
284,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Enjoyed a lot, but I didn’t find it 100% convincing. Learned a lot of interesting stuff, though. I’m convinced that Darwinian sexual selection is important, and not merely as a proxy for fitness. But I’m not sure I’m ready to accept this as aesthetic selection either. Would like to read more about the topic. Prum is a good writer."

However, I found some parts to be a bit too specialized/dense for me, and other parts to be lacking in details to convince me further. Still, an interesting read, and recommended for anyone interested in evolution in general and bird evolution in particular."
286,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65242654-daniel-hjelm,4,"I found this book very enriching to my understanding of evolution. Since I do not think any supernatural agencies are the originators of any of the species on this planet, darwin's evolution by natural selection has been my goto source to comprehend our origin. This book has extended that understanding with the role that mate choice has in shaping our morphology and habit patterns."

290,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,4,"On 19 June 2017, I spotted an article in The National Geographic entitled “Why It Matters Who Females Choose to Have Sex With”. It had a description accompanying it, “Warning: graphic duck sex” (goo.gl/2ihKx2). Of course, I clicked. How could I resist? 😊 The article begins:Charles Darwin made Victorians splutter into their tea when he wrote ”The Descent of Man”, subtitled “selection in relation to sex.” In it, he not only claimed that animals and birds select their mates according to what he called “the taste for the beautiful.” He also suggested that independent female sexual choice (and pleasure)—an idea that was anathema to Victorian society—was an important driver for evolution.The article was actually an interview with the evolutionary ornithologist Richard O. Prum, Professor of Ornithology, and Head Curator of Vertebrate Zoology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, about his new book: The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us.The interview includes references to a controversy dubbed Duckpenisgate, pro-choice ducks, forced copulation, avenue bowers, and even male deweaponisation. The interview was quite short, but I was intrigued.About a month later, on 8 July 2017, The New Yorker re-posted its piece entitled “Duck Sex and the Patriarchy” with a description, “Why freedom of choice matters to animals, and what that tells us about human culture” (goo.gl/EqMZp5). I clicked, again. It was written by Richard O. Prum himself. He says:Most of us, for example, learned a strictly adaptationist version of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution; we were told that almost every feature of the biotic world, no matter how tiny, could be explained by how it contributed to an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. In fact, though, Darwin also proposed a theory of sexual selection, in which animals may choose their mates according to aesthetic standards—their own subjective desires. This view has frequently been rejected as too anthropomorphic precisely because it implies that sexual selection can act independently of natural selection—an unsettling thought for the typical adaptationist.He tells us that there are enormous differences between the sexual politics of birds and people, naturally, as people are intellectually, socially, and culturally more complex than birds, but that “in seeking to understand the complexities of human evolution and sexuality, we can learn a lot by examining the diversity of life on Earth and acknowledging the parallels where they exist”. He continues to talk about the sexual arms race between male and female ducks, not a fair fight. “While male ducks evolve to gain physical and sexual control over females, female ducks evolve to assert, and reassert, their freedom of choice. Sound familiar?” I whispered, “Yes,” and decided to read the book as soon as possible.Now that I have, I am delighted to have spotted the articles. The Evolution of Beauty is unexpectedly, phenomenally, and poignantly feminist, especially because it was written by a man. His theories about beauty might not be popular in evolutionary biology, but he still makes an interesting case.The first two-thirds of the book include the introduction, a chapter on Darwin’s idea of mate choice, a chapter on several bird species—namely, the great argus, manakins, ducks, and bowerbirds—but in Chapter 8 through 12 Prum writes about humans and other primates. The first part on birds is excellent, but I found Prum’s hypotheses about the sexual evolution of humans driven by female mate choice particularly interesting. Reviews online offer a wide array of conflicting opinions about Prum’s hypotheses concerning aesthetic evolution, although almost everyone seems to love his descriptions of the love life of birds. In terms of topics, Prum writes about aesthetic co-evolution, beauty, eugenics, female-female competition, female mate choice, female sexual autonomy, infanticide, male aesthetic deweaponization, male-male competition, male paternal investment, mating value and how it changes across time and space, pleasure, same-sex preferences, sexual conflict, sexual selection mechanisms, sexual selection in the evolution of the scrotum, the human penis and why it dangles, the evolution of orgasm as an aesthetic, coevolutionary lovefest, and much, much more. Some of the topics might seem irreverent, but they are not. Prum is simply at ease with the theme of sexuality, moulding The Evolution of Beauty into a fantastically relaxing and entertaining read.Human sexuality is nothing like the sexuality of other old-world monkeys. The “average” female old-world monkey, Prum says, “lives a life of sexual subjugation with limited opportunity for real sexual autonomy”. Male infanticide is an omnipresent risk in the lives of chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas. However, there is virtually no male infanticide in humans, which is a major evolutionary change. It involved a decrease in male-male competition and sexual coercion as well as an advance in the sexual autonomy of females. The question is, under what conditions do males surrender their weapons?Prum suggests it would make sense to explore evolutionary mechanisms that explicitly focus on male violence and on those evolutionary agents who would benefit most from its transformation, ie, females.The author concedes that his hypotheses are just that, hypotheses, but he does have a refreshingly pro-female view of aesthetic evolution by mate choice. He tells us that over millions of years since our common ancestry with the chimpanzees human males have been transformed to be less coercive, disruptive, and violent through the process of aesthetic deweaponization. “Deweaponization is essentially the reduction of male armaments […] through female mate choice.” He is referring to the reduction in size dimorphism (ie, human males are still larger than females, but the difference in size between men and women is not quite as pronounced as in other primates) and the loss of elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth that “male primates use to assert violent control over each other and over females and their dependent young”. The whole process has evolved because female sexual autonomy results in greater infant survival, lower direct harm to females, and enhanced population growth. However, Prum emphasises, as I should also, that the process of aesthetic deweaponization does not mean turning males into emasculated, wimpy, or subordinate males. “[T]he defenders of patriarchy often mischaracterize feminism as an ideology of power. Feminists, they claim, are attempting to take control of men’s lives, deny them their natural, biological prerogatives, and put men in a subservient position.” Just like the sexual autonomy of ducks, feminism has nothing to do with power or control over others. Feminism is about the freedom of choice. “This asymmetry of goals—the patriarchal aim of advancing male dominance versus the feminist commitment to freedom of choice—is inherent in all sexual conflict, from ducks to humans. But it gives the contemporary cultural struggle over universal sexual equal rights an especially frustrating quality.”At this point, I asked Prum a (rhetorical) question, “Fine, but if men today are the result of our female ancestors’ excellent taste in the opposite sex why have women for most of human history been and, in some places, still are treated as lesser beings?” Less than a century ago, women could not vote (eg, in France, women’s right to vote was signed into law only in 1944 and in Switzerland, women finally gained the right to vote in federal elections only after a referendum in 1971, while in Portugal they were allowed to vote by the constitution of 1976). Less than a century ago, many women still had no say in the choice of their future husband and, in many parts of the world, they still don’t. Sometimes women’s rights vanish into thin air almost overnight (eg, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan). The answer soon followed. Prum writes:In the later chapters of the book, I have proposed that the evolutionary struggle for female sexual autonomy played a critical role in the evolution of human sexuality and reproduction and was a critical factor in the evolution of humanity itself. But if this is true, why aren’t the women of the world enjoying the proposed fruits of this evolutionary process—universal fulfilment of sexual and social autonomy? The ongoing existence of rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, arranged marriage, honor killings, everyday sexism, economic dependence, and political subservience of women in many human cultures might seem to be direct evidence to falsify this view of human evolutionary history. Are we forced to acknowledge that such behaviors are an inescapable part of “human nature”—a part of our evolutionary legacy that humans will never overcome? I think not, and sexual conflict theory can help us to understand why.Sexual conflict theory tells us that female aesthetic remodelling is not the only evolutionary force at work […]. Males are simultaneously evolving through the force of male-male competition (another form of sexual selection), which can work simultaneously to maintain and advance sexual coercion. This process happens because there are limits to the effectiveness of female mate choice. It can expand female sexual autonomy, but it is not a mechanism for the evolution of female power or sexual control over males. As long as males continue to evolve mechanisms to advance their capacity for sexual coercion and violence, females may remain at some disadvantage. As I explained in the context of duck sex, the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical—not really a war at all. Males evolve weapons and tools of control, while females are merely coevolving defences of their freedom of choice. It’s not a fair fight.In short, it’s an arms race. Prum holds that “despite the near ubiquity of male culture dominance, […] patriarchy is not inevitable, and it does not constitute human biological ‘destiny’ (whatever that is). Patriarchy is a product not of our evolutionary history nor of human biology per se but of human culture.” Patriarchy developed to reassert male control over fertilization, reproduction, and parental investment as a countermeasure to the evolutionary expansion of female sexual autonomy. It is for that reason that women today are prevented from fully enjoying the previous evolutionary gains in sexual autonomy, ie, a less coercive, disruptive, and violent male.The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of cultural countermeasures to reassert and preserve female sexual and social autonomy: the rise of feminist movements for women’s suffrage, access to education, and rights to property and inheritance, etc. Such advances show us that it is possible to disrupt the deep roots of patriarchy. However, they also show us that we can expect that each side will continue to create new countermeasures to neutralise the previous advances made by the other. A sobering thought.In Chapter 10, which is built around Artistophanes’s anti-war comedy Lysistrata, first staged in 411 B.C.E., Prum introduces the idea of sexual conflict in humans, which occurs “whenever the evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge in the context of reproduction”. For example, the number and identity of sexual partners, sexual fidelity, frequency of sex, types of sexual behaviours, control of fertilization, timing of reproduction, number of offspring, and how much each partner invests—in terms of energy, time, and resources—in the care of those offspring, are all issues that can, and often do lead to sexual conflict.The play itself is an account of one woman’s endeavour to put an end to the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata talks the women of Greece into withholding sex from their husbands and lovers until a treaty is signed. Soon enough, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide that peace is the only option and women return to their men. Prum says that “[t]he ancient lessons of Lysistrata are clear. Individuals can transform human society through their affirmative sexual choices.” Women are not only sexual objects, but also sexual subjects with their own desires and concepts of beauty. They also have the evolved agency to seek them out in their partners. What we find desirable in a mate can bring about cultural change. In other words, “[w]hen sexism becomes unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, then patriarchy may finally give up its remaining weapons.” As far as I am concerned, sexism is unacceptably antisocial and hopelessly unsexy, but many women who do have an opportunity to exercise their right of choice without fear of legal or physical punishment or even death seem quite happy with their assigned position and role in the structures of contemporary patriarchy. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls this Feminism Lite (goo.gl/dtfk6b) and Sarah Ditum refers to it as Cool Girl Feminism (goo.gl/b46mup). It seems that men have developed a powerful weapon in the war of the sexes: male-male co-operation. Prum tells us that aesthetic evolution and sexual conflict likely also had a role in the origins of human intelligence and social organization. By exercising their mate choice and thus making males less coercive, aggressive and violent towards other males, their offspring, and the opposite sex, females may have helped turn males into more social beings who are more likely to engage in male-male co-operation. Prum mentions male-male co-operation in birds, while Yuval Noah Harari suggests as much when trying to find an explanation for masculine dominance over women in Sapiens: How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the common assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo sapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and competitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater tendency to cooperate.Women usually do not engage in female-female co-operation to the extent men do, and nobody knows why. There are only good guesses. Although women are supposedly more co-operative, the truth is that women in general do not like other women outside their small closed peer groups, and even these small groups function along strict hierarchies. We might not prefer to talk about female aggression and violence, but women and girls do engage in more social forms of aggression, such as everyday gossip, backstabbing, malicious rumour-mongering, and social exclusion. For a woman, these can have dire, and sometimes even deadly consequences.It is true that sexual selection is both a competitive and co-operative bi-directional process. It is an arms race, but it is also a beauty pageant. However, as long as the majority of human males choose to keep rank in defence of patriarchy, instead of equality, and as long as the majority of women fail to stand together and come up with their own definition of authentic femininity, instead of buying into the myth of infantilized, sexualised, transmorphed, subservient womanhood concocted into existence by male imagination and sold at a profit by the fashion and beauty industry, the number of paths open to women will remain limited. If the rules one has to follow are skewed in favour of those who made them, there is little one can do but obey, or suffer the consequences. We are lucky that so many of our female ancestors, both ancient and more recent ones, dared to resist and exercise their autonomy, leading us to this moment. The world might not be perfect, but the situation for women has improved in so many parts of the world, despite the chauvinistic male-centred opposition in our midst. We should never forget, however, that things change and that humans are a work in progress. Mating choices we make today will affect future generations when we are long gone. I would prefer men and women of the future, our sons and daughters of tomorrow, to live in a world we shall have made better, safer, and more beautiful through our freedom of choice today."

293,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"The author has convinced me this is a stunningly original read. Full of interesting questions, contradictions, and theories that I've never encountered before. Richard Prum is the sort of person that fills me with the motivated excitement of someone who wants to be just like him one day, and the depressing futility of knowing it's already too late for that. He's spent his entire life studying a single topic, and has so much obvious passion for it that seems to have only increased with age. Even with hugely consequential life events like cereal, I am ecstatic for exactly 2 spoons before I get bored. I chanced upon this book while trying to answer some questions about beauty for my book, and thought his articles about the topic were enough. I normally wouldn't have then bothered with the whole book, but I got pretty sick and the audiobook just rattled on in the background. Thankfully it isn't read by him, I watched his YT videos and this guy really needs a speech therapist. Cool bitsDescent of Man seemed to go against Natural selection with sexual selection being a competing process. Noone wanted to accept it, especially not Victorian England averse to the concept of female independent sexual choice. Alfred Russell Wallace, though beaten to it by Darwin, might have had the last say, because he reduced Darwin’s more subtle complex interplay of processes into a brute interpretation of natural selection, thus seeing even sexual selection in terms of the signaling of fitness and ignoring the aesthetic evolution that Darwin postulatedThis continued through the generations of evolutionary thought, until Fisherian Runaway theory by the mathematician, which suggested that while beauty could have initially signaled fitness, the coevolution of mate choice and these characteristics would lead to a runaway evolution that quickly divorced the trait from its underlying fitness-variable, so beauty became a thing in itself. Handicap Principle showed up in opposition to Fisherian runaway, strengthening a more Wallace-oriented look at beauty as still natural selection, that a peacock’s tail shows how fit it is to survive. Problem with this is mathematical. The handicap will get worse and worse and worse, where does it end. SNL skit about Smucker’s Jelly, with a name like that you know it’s got to be great. Equilibrium between the handicap of long attractive tail and the fitness of short functional tail will be reached. Manakin makes music through complex oscillations of its bones and feathers. Evolution of skeletal structure is sub-optimal for flight so has evolved purely for aesthetic reasons. Even though females don’t engage in this display of music, they also inherit this inferior skeleton but that’s fine because the advantages of the male offspring’s ability to create music offsets the handicap of the femalesWas originally thought that feathers evolved for flight, but that’s like saying fingers evolved to play the piano. Only the best fingers can able. Velociraptors had feathers. By studying the intermediate stages that led from scale to the feather as we see it today, and tracing the evolutionary purpose and advantage of each stage, there is a problem. First stage was tufty down which is easy to explain as thermoregulation, like a duckling. But then there is the transition to planar veined feathers, seems like the only reason is that tufty down is like human hair that can’t have complex color displays whereas planar veined feathers now created a smooth aesthetic body that could develop intricate and fantastic colors.Female autonomy as the engine for beauty. Contrast ducks and bower birds. There is a common problem of forced copulation. Males want it, females run the risk of having to deal with inferior male genes that they didn’t choose. Ducks evolved defense mechanisms of screw-like vagina that impedes penetration, male ducks co-evolved a complex counter-screw penis that unfolds like a sweater sleeve inside out and is powered hydraulically with lymph rather than blood vessels. Ducks are assholes, don’t be like duck. Somewhere long ago, a bird ancestor lost the penis and that’s 95% of birds now. This puts all sexual autonomy in claws of female by reducing forced copulation. See bower bird having to construct complex bowers to house his honey before she is impressed enough to tap that. Female feels safe to watch the male from the bower as he struts his stuff. If she doesn’t want any, she can fly off, he can’t force himself on her. In contrast, certain bower birds don’t make refuges, so the female can’t sit next to the male and watch patiently, in these species she observes from afar and then approaches only if she wants to do the business, hence there is no evolution of complex beauty to the male displays here. Lek theories were very chauvinist, either hotshot theory, that males want to be near the hotshots and enjoy the fact that he’ll attract many females, or hotspot theory, that the lek itself attracts a lot of females and he can be where the action is, like some music festival. The truth is more feminist, that Leks exist because the females want them to exist, like some reverse-brothel. Manakins spend most of their time rehearsing and putting on a carefully choreographed group dance while fussy judgmental female looks on and picks the alpha she likes, thus selecting for those males who are able to form long term cooperative relationships with other males, selecting out stupid aggression. Why do the non-alpha males help? Because once group dances evolved, females don’t want nothing less, so they don’t get a choice either way. Human Beauty: Lost hair for better thermoregulation, but kept it on armpits and pubes not functionally but because it could cultivate fauna that served as pheromone dispenser. So much for beauty standards of today. Female primates don't have permanently engorged breast tissue, purely aesthetic. Human penises are disproportionately enormous for body size, and ribbed for her pleasure, compared to chimps and gorillas. While gorillas don't have to worry about sperm competition since they are tournament species, chimps do, and that's why they have obscenely outsized testes. If large human penis and ribbing was for sperm competition (gets closer to ova, and ribbing removes previous sperm), then giant testes would have developed, which didn't, and chimps wouldve got our dicks, which they didn't. Purely for her pleasure. Similarly, pretty much all mammals have a vaculum, a bone in the boner. It not only brings about the erection, but also retracts penis once done. Why did humans lose it? Original theory was handicap, that if we could show females an erection even without this bone, we must be awesome. But pretty much every male can get an erection, so it's not much of a handicap (but maybe the ones who couldn't don't exist today?) and there is no connection between dick size and erectile dysfunction so it's not like its particularly energy expensive. Purely aesthetic, we wanted to walk around with the schlong hanging about to show women, it's also why our scrotums hang obscenely unlike primates. Nice conjecture that genesis talks about 'rib' of Adam but actually means Vaculum, because the hebrew word for rib meant overall supportive structure, and rib is sorta random one must admit. Human female orgasm: Theory 1, it is a spandrel like the male nipple. Sexist male-centric view denying female agency whereas most of nature seems to suggest it is female preference that drove evolution. Theory 2, upsuck from uterine contractions that prefers better gene sperm giving advantage over all the other guys dis ho bangd. In apes though females have potential for orgasm they’ve never been seen during intercourse so no upsucking is happ. Leaves us with controversial idea that it evolved for pleasure, the non-functional basis of this would also explain the range and diversity of orgasms. Male orgasm: Iffy territory has been reached. First claim is that orgasm is more pleasurable than it really needs to be for motility of sperm (contrast with pleasure of eating, should orgasm be so much more pleasurable than eating really?), so can’t be just natural selection. Next claim that it is more pleasurable and varied than ape orgasms which last seconds, involve no foreplay or eyecontact. Very uncomfortable anthropomorphism that I couldn’t get past. But a nice idea that mutual mate choice might be the reason male orgasms became more pleasurable, that it took more choosy males to develop pleasure than the usual slutty male with cheap sperm that is freely available to any female that wants it. Lysistrata effect: Female mate choice might have chosen for less aggressive males, gradually bringing down sexual dimorphism in humans, and reduction of rape, infanticide, and violence. This is used to explain the evolutionary basis for homosexuality."
294,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"I was excited that one of the New York Times's five best non-fiction books of 2017 was science-adjacent, but perhaps that set my expectations too high. Prum's big idea here is that a species may randomly decides it likes something it thinks of as ""beautiful,"" and then taste for that characteristic will co-evolve with the characteristic itself, making things more and more extreme even if that extremeness actively harms the species's fertility or ability to survive. This theory is not new, as he is the first to acknowledge; indeed, he urges the reader to think of this as something Charles Darwin advocated before the idea was lost by subsequent defenders who monomaniacally focused on natural rather than sexual selection.Prum is primarily an ornithologist, and the first 200 pages or so of the book are about birds, largely drawn from his own research. That was mostly pretty interesting (although after all his hyping of how dazzling the Great Argus pheasant's display was, it was rather disappointing to look up a picture and see it), even if his argument that his theory is the obvious null hypothesis (!) and so should be taken as the default in every situation unless there's clinching evidence against it seemed unconvincingly sweeping. But then, Chapter 8 turns to the same processes among humans. ""Hmm,"" I thought as I read it, ""his editors or publisher must have made him throw this random people-focused chapter in to cynically try to make the book salable to a wider audience, because this is both less interesting and less convincing."" Then he spends the next 300 pages on humans, and the coherence and interest of the book rapidly dissipated. Chapters from that point are often random grab bags of what Prum admits are often purely speculative thoughts without a lot of supporting evidence. For instance, there's a chapter on where Prum thinks homosexuality comes from evolutionarily; that both wasn't obviously related to the main themes he set up in the bird-related material, and ended up feeling like a jumble of vaguely relevant thoughts. If the book had stopped after the first seven chapters, I probably would have given it four stars. Prum's fulsome—in the traditional sense of ""unctuous,"" not whatever it is people use it to mean these days—praise of everyone he mentions working with is sometimes bizarre (for instance: Patricia ""Patty"" Brennan, a ""remarkably enterprising post-doc"" from his lab, is ""vivacious, enthusiastic, and scientifically unstoppable....With two young children and a bit of gray hair, she still looks like the aerobics instructor she was....She is also a mean salsa dancer, which is to say still una Colombiana""). And self-awareness can feel a bit low when an endowed professor at Yale who has received a MacArthur Fellowship complains, in a book from a big mainstream publisher, that his ideas don't get enough of a hearing in science. But it was a contagiously enthusiastic account of lots of tropical birds that I'd never heard of, so I felt like I was learning a lot. Shame about the second half of the book, though."
295,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"So Darwin wrote 2 important books: On the Origin of Species, which went mainstream as the Adaptive Evolution Theory, or survival of the fittest; and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. The latter was heavily criticised by his contemporary Wallace and current thinking reflect the ‘pure’ Darwinism. This was because Darwin proposed that female mating choice stems from the aesthetics of the male, and that can lead to maladaptive evolution, for example choosing to mate with the dashing James Dean over boring but dependable Average Joe. For too long, beauty in nature has been explained using the Handicap Theory, saying that the fittest males can afford to have unwieldy tales; Prum argued that in that case it will cease to be a useful adaptive advantage!Being an ornithologist, Prum showed may examples in birds which support the Sexual Selection theory. In most of his examples, the female was the sole care taker of the young, and males not contributing anything in this regard. First, male Manakins did elaborate dances to seduce the females. Second, some Manakins sang with their wings. Why would they need that since all birds can sing? He posited that it was because the females prefer the beauty of the songs, so they mated with males with the best dance and songs, leading to offspring that also preferred this, and so on and on. Then he explained about ducks. Most birds have no male sex organs, but ducks have male organs that can be 2/3 of the length of their body! Female ducks chose their partners and mated; unfortunately in crowded habitats, the females were also under constant threat of forced copulation, sometimes leading to injury and death! So the females developed defensive mechanisms to make sure that only the genetic material of the desired male were kept. Next came the bowerbirds. The male built elaborate bowers so that the female can come and inspect different bowers to choose the best male. The bowers served to protect the female from unwanted advances. Prum posited that female choice can drive male change of behaviour, to build better and nicer bowers. Differences in taste in the female can also lead to vastly different bowers in different species. Back to the manakins in the lek dance system. So males have to join groups led by an alpha bird to learn the trick of the dance. 80% of them would never mate with afemale, but that was their only chance. The young male with the most connections enjoyed the highest chance of becoming the alpha bird. Females would visit a few troupes and choose the best. Then Prum went to humans, and I must say that part was the weakest, since there were a lot of conjectures but not enough data. Nonetheless I totally enjoyed this book and I would never look at ducks the same way again. "
296,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"I vacillated between two and three stars. Two because the first half of the book is full of such arcane detail about birds’ mating habits that you keep asking yourself, “Why again was I reading this?”He is challenging the wholesale buy-in to species differentiation being solely due to survival - traits and elements that allow for genes to be passed on. A trait only gets passed on over time if it makes you stronger and more dominant. But looking at birds’ plumage and coloring, as well as their songs and mating dances, there is no connection to survival. They often make survival harder, by making a bird more easily targeted. In fact, these traits seem to be about choosing a mate based on aesthetics. Aesthetics and Darwin?!? Apparently the man himself addressed this exact issue, arguing that beauty is considered in mate choice. So the bird part is pretty esoteric. An interesting element is that he argues that females are running this beauty contest. Ha! The tables are turned! They pick the male with the best plumage display. Later in the book, though, he applies this beauty theorem to humans. Hmmm! Much food for thought! He writes about cultural constructs of beauty, and how specific traits get selected for in different cultures. He even spends some time on the role of homosexuals in a culture’s passing on its best genes. Read this if you’re up for a long tome of sometimes obscure avian biology, and assertive applications of this theory of beauty to humans."
297,Pulitzer,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18679489-shariq-chishti,5,Every now and then you stumble upon a book which changes the way you think. The Evolution of beauty is one such book for more than one reasons. I have known about but remain completely oblivion to the details of birding and the bird universe. While reading this book I spent numerous hours watching bird dance videos on You Tube and shared them with my family members. I had seen them before but reading the book gave a new meaning to it all. Secondly the idea of evolution of beauty for the sake of beauty is a fascinating idea and something I am completely on board about. Of course its still speculative but so were most of other brilliant ideas. The bird sex is fascinating and I`ll never look at the ducks the same way again.The last few chapters about humans and the dangling penis is also interesting and very feminist in outlook. Absolutely amazing. The idea in Evolution of Beauty is not author`s own but Darwin`s himself but somewhere in between it got lost. Reading about the history of the idea of evolution from Darwin`s days to present era is also very informative about workings and history of science itself.

Our recent civilization,started from agriculture civilization, reassert male dominance over female not though biological difference, but through culture. By restoring long forgotten, often misinterpretation of Darwin's second independent evolutionary mechanism: subjective sexual selection not adaptive natural selection, we could recover from harmful one-side adaptation view which perpetuate and legalize male domination over female, hostility of same-sex relationship, etc.and rethink sex role,our sexual autonomy and social autonomy, and its impact on our daily life and how we view ourselves.Summary: 1. True Darwinism Darwinian vision has two distinct independent evolutionary mechanism,natural selection  in book The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selections  and sexual selection  in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex . One is objective, adaptive to natural force, hence natural selection. Another is subjective, arbitrary. They are potentially interacting and conflicting. Since Darwin published The Descent , his sexual selection is viewed as anti-Darwinism, he is regarded as a traitor of true Darwinism. Darwin of Sexual Selection--law of battle: often male-male competition, sexual control lead to large body, horns, antlers, sex coercion.--taste of beauty: often female. coevolutionary: cognitive standards of beauty in concert with the elaboration of display trait. female sexual autonomy is predominantly responsible for the evolution of natural beauty. Aesthetic evolution,arbitrary, nonadaptive,subjective, unlimited, internal, self-directed process, usually female as active agents in charge, seeking sexual autonomy, free mate choice Darwin/Fisher, Modeled by Lande, Kirkpatrick. Natural Selection: Adaptive evolution, objective, very limited, external force: competition, predation, climate, geographyThe current view: Neo-Darwinism: mate-choice is a variant of natural selection, utilitarian value. sexual selection is a simply a form of nature selection. Sexual selection is handmaiden of natural selection. Display trait evolve because it provide honest information about good genes or direct benefits. All beauty provides a rich profile of practical information about the adaptive qualities of potential mate. Color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, cognitive ability, fitness to survive,etc.The new view: --Revive Darwin sexual selection theory. Sexual selection is not hand maiden of natural selection, it is independent evolution force. Beauty is in the eye of the be holder. subjective, cognitive, arbitrary, aesthetic view, mate of choice, coevolutionary, female sexual autonomy , Null Hypothesis theory. --Reject absolute adaptationist. Beauty-as-utility, utilitarian view, or adaptive mate choice objective natural selection, such as Zahavi's Handicap principle.fully aesthetic theory of mate choice include arbitrary null model (Beauty Happens) and adaptive mate choice: interaction of sexual selection and natural selection (honest signaling good genes and direct benefits)  - my words: adaptive here is not narrow adapt to objective natural force and also adapt to subjective taste of beautyThe implication of this book: organisms definitely have a say in its evolution history by their mate-choice, completely subjective, anesthetic. Evolution is not totally controlled by natural force. Both subjective sexual selection and objective natural selection play roles in biological evolution . 2. History of confusion of adaption.--fitness: To Darwin, fitness means physical capacity to do the tasks necessary to ensure one's survival and capacity for reproduction. In our modern time, fitness has more general, broader meaning, survival, fecundity, mate/fertilization success. This redefinition obscure subtle Darwinian distinction between natural selection on traits ensured survival and fecundity and sexual selection on traits resulted in differential mating and fertilization success, that is, traits may even have disadvantage in survive. --p52 The flattening of the intellectual complexity of aesthetic Darwinism was motivated, at least in part, by the belief that conceptual unification is a general scientific virtue, that the development of fewer more powerful, more broadly applicable, singular theories, laws, and frameworks is a fundamental goal of science itself... something complex is explained away instead of being explained in its own right. ... Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation. Evidence and arguments to support of subjective sexual selection: mate of choice1. Good ornaments is good predicts of gene? Hardly.2. symmetry is good genetic quality has no scientific base or simply our bias try to make sense of the world.3. Null, negative results hardly get published, publication bias and confirmation bias. 4. extreme aesthetic performance is simply show vigor or justly for beauty sake?5. adaptation view of beauty is extrinsic, for good genes or directed benefits, as in rhyme and reason. Darwin/Fisher view, Beauty is intrinsic, has value in and itself, its social contrivance everyone agree. compared with money, adaptation view is goldbug 〈美俚〉主张金本位的人, beauty view as ""dollar view "" based on social contrivance. 6. Neo-Wallacean adaptive mate-choice evolutionary is too limited, beauty is just for beauty, which may have little value, no value, so sometime again survival, beauty decadence.7. Feather does not evolve to flight. Rather before flight, animals already have feather. Anesthetic feature first before later use for flight.8. Rensch's rule: relationship between the extent of sexual size dimorphism and which sex is larger. size dimorphism increases with increasing body size when the male is the larger sex, and decreases with increasing average body size when the female is the larger sex. Ape is the example, but body mass of female and male is no big difference, support evolution favor female sex autonomy.9. In human, both male and female are choosy.10. Female mate choice is not dominance or sex control, only freedom of choice. It is a adaptive to lower male sexual coercion, lower infanticide. The struggle is asymmetrical, with male dominance over female, female try to preserve the freedom of choice.11. Patriarch is the culture product, the social construct to assert male dominance. =================Terms:sex behavior(it is a biological terms) vs. sex identity (it is social terms, it is very recently development after agricultural civilization)sexual autonomy: the capacity ( sensory perception, cognitive capacities for sensory evaluation , mate choice )for an individual organism to exercise an informed, independent, and uncoerced sexual choice about whom to mate with. It is is an evolutionary engine of beauty. sexual attraction: the object of desire (aka display traits) and the form of desire itself (aka mating preference)Null hypothesis: nothing special is happening. No specific, or special, explanation is required to account for the observation we made. It never proved or established, but it is possibly disproved. ""Cigarettes do not cause lung cancer"" is null hypothesis. Scientific burden of proof always lies with those who want to know that something specific is happening, not on those who think that is not. It is hypothesis that proposed, generalized causal mechanism is absent.

Evolutionary psychology teaches us that certain mate choices are sanctioned by science as adaptive (that is, universally good) while others not, and these views are changing how we think about ourselves.chap 9 Pleasure happenssummary: female pursuit of sex pleasure is at the very heart of the evolution of human beauty and sexuality.

I learned so much reading this book: about bizarre bird mating rituals, about the variance between chimpanzee, gorilla and baboon sex, about prevailing theories on the evolution of the female orgasm. And, most of all, about the intransigence of long-held ideas, even and maybe especially in academia."
