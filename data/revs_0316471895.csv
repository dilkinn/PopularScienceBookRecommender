And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realization of Utopias.”---Oscar Wilde.Rutger Bregman, the Dutch historian, first came to my attention when recently he got into a tiff with Tucker Carlson. The footage and audio was leaked, and though I wasn’t surprised to hear Carlson get upset with a guest, I was shocked to listen to the vehemence and the frankly crazed level of his response. I came away thinking, this Bregman really knows how to get under people’s skin. Of course, any time you even hint at a redistribution of wealth to a obscenely wealthy conservative, they get prickly and defensive. There never seems to be enough money for these type of people. They want it all. As prickly as they are about having to share their fortune with others, the stark truth is they took that wealth away from the rest of us in a variety of different ways. 62 people, at this very moment, are richer than 3.5 billion other people put together. Now really, it is laughable to consider. Why would anyone need that much wealth? Isn’t it a burden just to decide what to do with all of it? But I digress. The thing you will find as you read this book is that there will be frequent digressions. I ended up reading many parts of it out loud to my wife, and that led to looping, long discussions that really helped reshape some of our world views about what a real utopia would consist of. Bregman discusses three main points that will make a lot of sphincters tighten, including my own. Universal basic income, fifteen-hour work week, and a world without borders. Bregman is concerned about homelessness, as we all should be, but as I read about him talking about universal basic income, my first thought was for our overcrowded and expensive prison system. If those men have a basic income that will allow them to truly get on their feet, how much money will we save every year giving them the money directly instead of paying to keep them locked up? Now the first thought that most people will have is that something like this won’t work because why would people work? The studies that have been conducted on this concept show that people who don’t have to worry about where they are going to sleep or where their next meal is coming from start to think about educating themselves and finding worthwhile work. Of course, there are going to be failures, but as long as we are talking about the majority of participants showing a desire for achieving a better life, then we would be rehabilitating people instead of incarcerating them. Studies also found that, if they gave the money directly to the disadvantaged people, instead of putting it through the welfare department with all the red tape and hoops to jump through, the positive results skyrocketed. I’m all for eliminating the need for social services. You will hear people say that the disadvantaged are poor because they are lazy, and I think that those people really want to believe that, and no preponderance of evidence will change their minds, but for people with an open mind, this is pretty heady stuff to consider. Anybody want a 15 hour work week? I’m going to quote our friend Oscar Wilde again. ”Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.” I understand that there are people who really enjoy their jobs, and they should work as many hours at those jobs as they want to, but for most of us, our jobs are dehumanizing, boring, and meaningless. We have Henry Ford to thank for being an instigator of the 40 hour work week, or all us would still be working 60 or 70 hours or more. He discovered that workers are more efficient working fewer hours. He also understood that, if people have leisure time to go do things, they will buy... cars. They will go spend money on activities, which boosts the economy, which makes it easier for more people to afford...cars. So in other words, he discovered it was in his best interest to allow his workers to have a life beyond just working. When you look at a company like Walmart who treats and pays their workers horribly, they obviously don’t understand that, the more money they pay their workers, the more money those workers are going to spend in their store. The really annoying thing about a company like Walmart is they pay so poorly that a large percentage of their workers are on food stamps or government assistance, so all of us are supporting Walmart to make billions in profit. See what I mean about digressing? When I was a kid and watching The Jetsons, like most other American kids, I really thought the future was going to be an amazing place with flying cars, underwater cities, and short work weeks. I thought we would be a world of scholars, painters, writers...creative people. It never occured to me that the advances in technology, like cell phones, a plentiful food supply, and robots, would actually lead to us working longer hours. Does that make any sense? Why do so few benefit from the natural resources of the planet or from the technological advancements? How did I get cut out of the pie? One of the points that Bregman makes, that really hit home for me, is what he calls shifter jobs. These are careers devoted to moving money, but not actually creating wealth. The perfect example is a stockbroker or even a banker. They take money and shift it around. Bregman will convince you that we really don’t need any of these people. So why do those shifters make extraordinarily large salaries, and the real wealth creators, such as teachers, police officers, and nurses, get paid on the lower end of the scale? Our society is upside down. The other loss to all of society is that our best minds, instead of going into science, teaching, and medicine, become stock brokers, lawyers, advertising agents, and bankers. They become shifters instead of creators. We have seen how destructive those shifters have been to our financial markets throughout history, but also very recently in 2008. We can solve that. We can encourage those shifters to become contributors to society by raising taxes on those fabulously wealthy incentive packages they receive. I’ve known stock brokers. Some of them were actually great people caught in a vortex of greed; almost every one of them will tell you that they wished they were doing something more meaningful. I wasn’t a stock broker, but I held down a very meaningless job for twenty years. One of those jobs that is hard to explain to my kids what exactly I do. It was lucrative. I made twice what my wife made as a teacher. The contribution that I was making to society paled to what my wife did on a daily basis. I’ve been asked hundreds of times by people, who are familiar with my voracious reading and philosophizing, why I wasn’t a teacher?My reply: Because I couldn’t afford the pay cut? Brainwashing cuts deeps. The open borders question is an ongoing political battle in the United States. The way WE THE PEOPLE resolve this will have an influence all over the world. Whether it is a good idea or not, the U.S. still is a heavy influencer on the rest of the world. This applies to all things, not just border walls, so all the points that Bregman is discussing in this book is aimed at the U.S. for that very reason. I thought this quote summarized the escalating wall issue very well. They will never go back.”This brings us to a fascinating paradox: Open borders promote immigrants’ return. Take the border between Mexico and the US. In the 1960s, seventy million Mexicans crossed it, but in time 85% returned home. Since the 1980s, and especially since 9/11, the US side of the border has been heavily militarized, with a 2,000 mile wall secured by cameras, sensors, drones, and 20,000 border patrol agents. Nowadays, only 7% of illegal Mexican immigrants ever go back.”We want them to go back, but we trap them here. Who would want to deal with those border control agents? Who would trust any outcome with our court system that is so biased against Mexican immigration? I live in a city where 60% of the population is Hispanic. ICE is a frequent visitor to town, and it isn’t just the illegal aliens who disappear when they show up in town. Bregman certainly gave me a lot to ponder. He has given me intelligent talking points that will help bolster my own arguments with conservatives about these progressive ideas that are actually based on conservative principles. Remember, Richard Nixon wanted to put through universal health care and a universal basic income. The Democrats actually killed both measures for different reasons (They wanted more money for the basic income, and Teddy Kennedy wanted health care passed under his presidential administration), but the fact that Nixon, of all people, put forth these concepts to me shows that, if we can smudge out the D and R behind politician’s names and really discuss these concepts, maybe progressive ideas actually can be seen as the most sane route to creating a better society. History will prove us right.

I swear every time I finished a chapter, a new policy would be announced that completely moved the needle of social progress in the other direction. Solving poverty with a universal basic income? Nope, here's a Secretary of Labor who thinks the minimum wage is already too high. Reform the banking system so it's not one of the largest drivers of the economy? Let me introduce you to the newest Goldman Sachs exec to run a department in Washington. Open our borders up to reduce both US and worldwide inequality? Don't even get me started on that one.Note to self: After civilization inevitably collapses, come back and re-read this for ideas on how to rebuild society. While some of Bregman's ideas seemed not fully fleshed out and some are even contradictory to each other, I think that's part of the point. A utopian future is unknown, and open to experimentation and trial. He does a good job presenting some of these potential scenarios and backs his ideas up with solid historical examples and current data."

After having read Klein, Chomsky, and Ziegler, who are all primarily talking about the problems and showing some ways out of the dilemma, I find this new approach towards less ranting and more solutions very positive. What it differentiates from many left/right, conservative/progressive, capitalist/socialist, etc. writings is that it´s really trying to be neutral, although the author is pro social democracy and Keynesian economics.I´ve read many, mostly left, thinkers, and do you know what happens all the time? Instead of talking about how to find a compromise, solutions, built a better future together, there is mostly bashing of the opponent, no matter who is right or wrong and yes, there are cases where leftist politics can´t immediately be implemented and other solutions have to be found. There is so much faith, belief, conditioning, coincidences who conditions and indoctrinates one to be on one side, that an open discussion gets more and more impossible, but building a brighter future is only possible together with the economy, companies, and conservative parties because, well, they have the cash.One of the most important messages of this book is to leave the comfort zone of the own ideology and try to find interdisciplinary approaches to solve some of the inevitable problems, some of the essential already screaming from the cover. I am really trying to see the immense positive effects on general wealth capitalism brought, before neoliberalism turned it in the creepiest and most destructive creature man ever made, and, older and wiser as I am, see that fixing and optimizing societies to create a more human, sustainable, and fair economic system can only be made possible by cooperation, respect, and willingness to change, not by insults and hate. I mean, look at the world, your country, each comment section on Amazon and Goodreads, that´s are no productive contentions, that´s just hate trolling and sh**storming by people who read nonfiction books. Does one get the irony, reading to get knowledge and behaving like that in comment sections of books one doesn´t like? Back to the topic: Bregman is, as said, pro-human and pro-environment and he has the intention to help the opponents to find a way out of the current dilemmas without losing their reputation and too much money money. You know, breakdown of civilization, pitchforks, and torches, military, and police deserting, all pretty bad for shareholder values, quotations, and stock indexes, possibly even the mansion could get damaged. Bergman uses history and very much data and sources to prove his theses.Some main points:Universal basic income instead of the prison system and mass incarceration. People have secure basic needs satisfied, don´t turn to crime, can have a free education, all the money for prison industry can be used to build the welfare state, less police is needed for that reasons and can fight organized crime and white-collar crime instead, cities are better places to live, ghettos and hoods disappear, no single parent mothers in poverty with kids growing up without fathers,…Social inequality has to be reducedhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_...Best minds get lost, as they go into banking, managing, become shifters of money in the financial sector, brokers,… earning very much, people doing real jobs with their hands or social work, get nothing. Instead the talented could work as doctors, engineers, scientists, etc., but don´t do it, because it would be stupid to go in jobs with more work and less cash.Counterintuitive, but true, if the borders are open, the people go back to their home countries. Take the rich EU, US, etc. where people can freely move around for work, but return home. If, on the other hand, it´s dangerous to deadly to get across a secured border, hardly anyone goes back. If the wealth is isolated behind death strips and not fairly distributed, organized crime, black economy, political extremism, and terrorism have many unnecessary breeding grounds and again, the military and police have to invest money that could be used for the welfare state. Happy people don´t kill other happy people. No bureaucratic disses and shenanigans to get social services, no stigmatization, no coercion to do precarious work to not get homeless or stay hungry.If there are no taxpayers anymore, if there is no redistribution by higher wages, reducing working time, taxation of robots and capital, UBI, the system collapses. The most successful, biggest companies have fewer and fewer workers and will have to keep automating anything to stay global market leaders and everyone will copy their behavior. More and more people, fewer and fewer jobs, that´s a real-life exponential process, looking at you, economics.Raising taxes for the very rich who are already getting immense, hidden amounts of money by public fundings and subsidies in the multi k billion dimension each year, tax reliefs, or just hiding the money in tax havens, while fighting against socialist leftist social politics. Taxes on financial speculation.Richard Nixon was pro universal health and UBI and the democrats successfully fought against it.What will lead to all of it is that robots don´t buy, algorithms don´t consume, and that the immense wealth will be destroyed if it´s not redistributed. Or back to the middle ages and feudalism, then it could be possible for you, honorable god emperors of mammon.Does anyone know an anachronism? When there was slavery, the king said the empire and economy would collapse without them and forced labor. When there was the first talk about democracy, the elites said it would lead to barbary and destruction of the state. What does this say about the current discussion, when UBI, open borders, less working hours, welfare state.. are defined as not possible, mad, dangerous, bad for the kids, communistic, and would lead to the breakdown of society (yet again) and degeneration of humankind (mission already accomplished). I am a layman, but let's say that for just one week all factories on earth would produce useful stuff instead of senseless consumer crap, and it´s equitably distributed to everyone, the basic needs of everyone could be provided, nobody had to suffer, and the 50 to 100 billionaires who own as much as 3,5 billion people possibly wouldn´t starve.Some final pessimism, because I can´t get out of my skin.The funny thing is that there is no hard evidence, just replication crisishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...lies, and ultra soft economic and political, so called sciences, that are arguing pro destroying human lives and the planet for totally bonkers, not even real, reasons. Their arguments and attacks are a collection of propaganda methods, not a single thing that would be used in natural sciences, all just institutionalized madness that controls most of our lives. Do you know where else one old, white, not necessarily wise but demagogic, man tells a story and it gets viral and millions believe it and listen to everything and it escalates quickly? Yes, popular TV-talk shows with charismatic hosts.(view spoiler)[No, it´s of course politics.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course economics.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course faith.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[No, it´s of course… Ha, nothing else here, what did you expect, but the clicking was fun, wasn´t it? And great to exhaust oneself to get rid of the anger.  (hide spoiler)]What stunned me, once again, is how a short book can contain so much knowledge, solutions, and proofs that all sides of the spectrum together already had and could thus have intentions to reinvent social order in the 21 century, while all mass media is ignoring it and instead repeating mantras of endless exponential growth and fake pseudo statistics and extrapolations. I´ll avoid those topics in the future, everything is said, probably I´ll edit, write, pimp, and post a few dozen reviews of books I´ve already read about the stuff, but read no new ones anymore. If one gets it, it´s fine, one more working for a better future, if not, I won´t feed the trolls and waste my time anymore with adults unable to self-reflection, introspection, and compromises. I see so many intelligent people wasting their time or even having wasted their lives that way, that could instead have used their knowledge and expertise to find connecting factors to moderate thinkers of the other side of the political spectrum for the sake of a consensus, instead of continuing the hardliner vs. hardliner squabble. You know, communism and capitalism, it can both be stupid, just depending on fine-tuning. Capitalism degenerated to neoliberalism, destroying the environment and deferring human development, marxism degenerated to communism, killing more people than any authoritarian government style before.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_...I´ll set a good example by listing a bit of what is going wrong in the progressive, social democracy, green party, etc. spectrum and no, I am and will always be on the left side and know that this is the only way to realize utopias, by the way, proven by science and the numbers, but to know the weak spots is better than narcissism and megalomania.Arrogance and condescension, doing as if one has all the solutions, looking down jovially at the other party, making it impossible for them to be willing to change. To deter the youth, making them hate politics even more. Being offended when NGOs are more popular and successful, not questioning why Fridays for future has achieved more within months than they did in their whole career? Might it be that all people, no matter if they are conservatives or teenagers, hate it to be treated that way and automatically are against one?Pseudo intellectualism by playing around with unproven humanities, believing to have solutions by waving around theoretical concepts, bashing the other side for exactly the same behavior.A country with a fair, sustainable trade policy will not survive against the other predator states. The state has to use his companies as the weapons of the only possible conflict left between western states, the trade war, and help them in any way possible. Humans are not naturally nice, they are greedy, unicorn icecream lollypop is unrealistic. We all here are profiteers of this system, privileged as we are and there are young economists, entrepreneurs, and businessmen who want to find a solution or have disruptive business ideas and without their expertise, good ideas will be doomed to fail. The opposition is not even trying to take their hand, just as with tech and the ideas of their own youth, they play allmighty super brainer instead. Not investing in own education programs, without system propaganda, and enlightenment, the key element in the Nordic states, instead repeating the same political circle, not even daring to speak out the real problems, instead a bit of superficial environmental protection and pseudo reforms, instead just drops on the hot stone.Still hierarchical, no flat hierarchies, no open conversation, discussion, absolutely no difference to faith and ideology, unable to change opinion, revise, reflect, be open to new ideas. Doing as if all rich and all companies were evil, no differentiating between a Bill Gates with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (yes, he saves a lot of taxes, I know, but he does something) and a Rupert Murdoch with Foxnews. By the way, there is not much difference between Tucker Carlsons´ reaction to Bregman and how many leftists are reacting to conservatives. Not building a free, own press, as the right wingers and conservatives are doing it, although the internet would allow it for free without much money money. Technophobia: Giving nothing on the use of modern technology, not using direct democracy with all the internet options, fighting against genetic engineering and delaying one of the most important key technologies for the sake of humanity and against world hunger.Being unable to cooperate with and get funding by progressive companies that are interested in a change, because they have sustainable business models that are blocked by the current political system.I could tell much more, but it gets boring and yes, I am a true agnostic nihilist and meanwhile at the point where I despise all politicians the same, all part of the problem, not the solution, no matter what party. I, by the way, have a decade long history of activism, interest in politics, and talking to many people and that´s the result, don´t want to waste my time anymore. Try it yourself, it´s refreshing. And depressing. As said, I´m out, the ones in politics who are pretending to fight for these important ideals are incompetent wiseacres that aren´t able to read the 50 to 75 books that would be necessary to be visionary, realistic, and have an open mind although it would be essential for both their job and their so-called bigot hypocritical ideology to educate themselves. Or learn to open the mouth without insulting or belittling anyone and inhibiting a consensus this way. They are even worse than the opponents, because they occupy the important opposition that should normally speak out what´s the problem, a simulated educational political discussion in a classroom is doing more and finding more solutions, making it unable for the young ones to change something, even politicians like Trump are doing more for a positive change, because they mobilize a huge opposition by satirizing themselves and the system. Oh, yes, of course, those pseudo progressive wannabe Marxists are also unable to laugh about themselves. Thank the flying spaghetti monster this trash is finally out of my system. Engage in NGOs, politics is, at the moment, a waste of time and lifeblood, the ones who could change something are mostly anachronistic, anti paradigm shift dinosaurs that reached their position with nodding and following the wise path of the three monkeys of their own ideology, completely ignoring the world around them.For each party:right-wing: without wordsconservatives: backlashessocial democrats: without prospects, no real support for the Nordic modelgreen/liberal/alternative: see aboveYou didn´t expect I would rant against my own ideology, did you?I´ve added some extra information gossip about how I became so deeply cynical in the comments as message Nr. 7, titled BECAUSE THE REVIEW WAS TOO LONG AND I COULDN´T ADD IT:"
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam,3,"Capitalist or communist, it all boils down to a pointless distinction between two types of poor, and to a major misconception that we almost managed to dispel some 40 years ago – the fallacy that a life without poverty is a privilege you have to work for, rather than a right we all deserve.A breezy read with ideas that are backed up by genuinely interesting statistics and anecdotes.Argues that we can better society and move towards utopia by implementing three ideas: a 15 hour workweek, a universal basic income (UBI) and open borders.The problem isn't the programs he's advocating, it's the neoliberal lens he's viewing them from (he grotesquely spends the last chapter blowing Hayek and Friedman). The 15 hour workweek, for example, sounds fantastic the way he lays it out – more time to play, to dedicate to art, to spend with family and enjoy life – but there's already plenty of people in the retail sector working a 15 hour workweek. Their lives aren't idyllic, they're struggling against poverty. It's called precarity and politicians can't come up with any way to soften its sting. Of course, a genuine labour movement along the lines of the one that brought us the forty hour workweek could go a long way to making the 15 hour week desirable. But the author doesn't even acknowledge it's a problem. The UBI is the same thing. It's easy to imagine how it would improve my own life, and very tempting to see it as a solves-all for poverty. But if a heartless ghoul like Dick Cheney and his neolizard pal Rumsfeld advocated for it, then it's just not that simple. I don't think a UBI can work unless we have a universal right to education, healthcare and housing. Those are the three things that everyone in our society needs but no one can realistically be expected to pay for them upfront. What good is a UBI if we're all bogged down in student loads, health insurance bills and rent payments? Of course, that's exactly why conservatives are tripping all over their dicks for a ubi, so they can gut and privatize everything else and bring us all back to feudalism.His case for open borders is so vague I don't know what to make of it. If he just means accepting more immigrants, sure, I'm all for it. My own country, Canada, needs them. Immigrants contribute to society and to the economy in countless ways. Refugees, too. If nothing else there was a boost of civic morale when we started taking in large numbers of Syrian refugees (though I suspect that's going to bite Trudeau in the ass now that's he trying to backpedal away from it all). But what Bregman is advocating seems to go beyond even the current Eurozone, which really does seem like a disaster. I mean, it ended the beggar-thy-neighbour trade policies that used to result in war, but it also created a new caste of democratically unaccountable elites who are uninterested in a proletariat that gets to choose between a life on welfare benefits or immigration away from home just to make a basic living. He points out that in Africa, more money is lost to tax evasion than is received in aid, but I don't see how open, checkpoint-free borders are going to change that. Africa doesn't need any Luxembourgs. There's nothing wrong with the mechanisms he's proposing. They can all work to make our lives better. It's the ""ideology-free"" ideology of neoliberalism that's at issue. With the managerial mindset, it's hard to see how life could improve. It'd be a brand new world at implementation and then back to managed decline. On the other hand, if these were road markers of a truly progressive, leftist campaign, backed up by a collective will for a better world – well then maybe they're ideas worth investigating after all. Highlights:Like KSR and Sanders he advocates for a tax on socially useless financial speculation to pay for social programs, which I'd be all for: (view spoiler)[The upshot is that we’ve all gotten poorer. For every dollar a bank earns, an estimated equivalent of 60 cents is destroyed elsewhere in the economic chain. Conversely, for every dollar a researcher earns, a value of at least $5 – and often much more – is pumped back into the economy. Higher taxes for top earners would serve, in Harvard science-speak, “to reallocate talented individuals from professions that cause negative externalities to those that cause positive externalities.” (hide spoiler)]Somehow I actually don't own a cellphone: (view spoiler)[By the year 2013, six billion of the globe’s seven billion inhabitants owned a cell phone. (By way of comparison, just 4.5 billion had a toilet.) And between 1994 and 2014, the number of people with Internet access worldwide leaped from 0.4% to 40.4% (hide spoiler)]I agree with this 100%, but it's the only time he mentions it and he glosses over what such a politics would look like: (view spoiler)[Lest there be any misunderstanding: It is capitalism that opened the gates to the Land of Plenty, but capitalism alone cannot sustain it. Progress has become synonymous with economic prosperity, but the 21st century will challenge us to find other ways of boosting our quality of life. And while young people in the West have largely come of age in an era of apolitical technocracy, we will have to return to politics again to find a new utopia. (hide spoiler)]His case for a ubi: (view spoiler)[The great milestones of civilization always have the whiff of utopia about them at first. According to renowned sociologist Albert Hirschman, utopias are initially attacked on three grounds: futility (it’s not possible), danger (the risks are too great), and perversity (it will degenerate into dystopia). But Hirschman also wrote that almost as soon as a utopia becomes a reality, it often comes to be seen as utterly commonplace.Not so very long ago, democracy still seemed a glorious utopia. Many a great mind, from the philosopher Plato (427–347 B.C.) to the statesman Edmund Burke (1729–1779), warned that democracy was futile (the masses were too foolish to handle it), dangerous (majority rule would be akin to playing with fire), and perverse (the “general interest” would soon be corrupted by the interests of some crafty general or other). Compare this with the arguments against basic income. It’s supposedly futile because we can’t pay for it, dangerous because people would quit working, and perverse because ultimately a minority would end up having to toil harder to support the majority.But… hold on a minute.Futile? For the first time in history, we are actually rich enough to finance a sizable basic income. We can get rid of the whole bureaucratic rigamarole designed to force assistance recipients into low-productivity jobs at any cost, and we can help finance the new simplified system by chucking the maze of tax credits and deductions, too. Any further necessary funds can be raised by taxing assets, waste, raw materials, and consumption. (hide spoiler)]On inequality: (view spoiler)[By now, inequality is ballooning in almost every developed country. In the U.S., the gap between rich and poor is already wider than it was in ancient Rome – an economy founded on slave labor.12 In Europe, too, there’s a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. ... Granted, it all happened very fast. Whereas in 1964 each of the four largest American companies still had an average workforce of about 430,000 people, by 2011 they employed only a quarter that number, despite being worth twice as much.14 Or take the tragic fate of Kodak, inventor of the digital camera and a company that in the late 1980s had 145,000 people on its payroll. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy, while Instagram – the free online mobile photo service staffed by 13 people at the time – was sold to Face-book for $1 billion.The reality is that it takes fewer and fewer people to create a successful business, meaning that when a business succeeds, fewer and fewer people benefit. (hide spoiler)]Obviously we need massive redistribution of wealth, but how is that ever going to happen? Bregman remains mum. (view spoiler)[The scenario of radical inequality that is taking shape in the U.S. is not our only option. The alternative is that at some point during this century, we reject the dogma that you have to work for a living. The richer we as a society become, the less effectively the labor market will be at distributing prosperity. If we want to hold onto the blessings of technology, ultimately there’s only one choice left, and that’s redistribution. Massive redistribution.Redistribution of money (basic income), time (a shorter working week), taxation (on capital instead of labor), and, of course, of robots. As far back as the 19th century, Oscar Wilde looked forward to the day when everybody would benefit from intelligent machines that were “the property of all.” However, technological progress may make a society more prosperous in aggregate, but there’s no economic law that says everyone will benefit.Not long ago, the French economist Thomas Piketty had people up in arms with his contention that if we continue down our current path we’ll soon find ourselves back in the rentier society of the Gilded Age. People who owned capital (stocks, houses, machines) enjoyed a much higher standard of living than folks who merely worked hard. For hundreds of years the return on capital was 4–5%, while annual economic growth lagged behind at under 2%. Barring a resurgence of strong, inclusive growth (rather unlikely), high taxation on capital (equally improbable), or World War III (let’s hope not), inequality could develop to frightening proportions once again.All the standard options – more schooling, regulation, austerity – will be a drop in the bucket. In the end, the only solution is a worldwide, progressive tax on wealth, says Professor Piketty, though he acknowledges this is merely a “useful utopia.” And yet, the future is not carved in stone. All throughout history, the march toward equality has always been steeped in politics. If a law of common progress fails to manifest itself of its own accord, there is nothing to stop us from enacting it ourselves. Indeed, the absence of such a law may well imperil the free market itself. “We have to save capitalism from the capitalists,” Piketty concludes.

When Henry Ford’s grandson gave labor union leader Walter Reuther a tour of the company’s new, automated factory, he jokingly asked, “Walter, how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues?” Without missing a beat, Reuther answered, “Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?” (hide spoiler)]He doesn't have a solution for what to replace GDP with, but I can't fault him for that. Inevitably you end up in the Tony Blair trap of measuring everything, and getting nothing done, like in that Adam Curtis doc: (view spoiler)[A great idea, admittedly. There’s no denying that GDP came in very handy during wartime, when the enemy was at the gates and a country’s very existence hinged on production, on churning out as many tanks, planes, bombs, and grenades as possible. During wartime, it’s perfectly reasonable to borrow from the future. During wartime, it makes sense to pollute the environment and go into debt. It can even be preferable to neglect your family, put your children to work on a production line, sacrifice your free time, and forget everything that makes life worth living.Indeed, during wartime, there’s no metric quite as useful as the GDP. ...The point, of course, is that the war is over. Our standard of progress was conceived for a different era with different problems. Our statistics no longer capture the shape of our economy. And this has consequences. Every era needs its own figures. In the 18th century, they concerned the size of the harvest. In the 19th century, the radius of the rail network, the number of factories, and the volume of coal mining. And in the 20th, industrial mass production within the boundaries of the nation-state.But today it’s no longer possible to express our prosperity in simple dollars, pounds, or euros. From healthcare to education, from journalism to finance, we’re all still fixated on “efficiency” and “gains,” as though society were nothing but one big production line. But it’s precisely in a service-based economy that simple quantitative targets fail. “The gross national product […] measures everything […] except that which makes life worthwhile,” said Robert Kennedy (hide spoiler)]On how to change people's minds and promote new ideas: (view spoiler)[James Kuklinski, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, discovered that people are most likely to change their opinions if you confront them with new and disagreeable facts as directly as possible. ... If it is true that that ideas don’t change things gradually but in fits and starts – in shocks – then the basic premise of our democracy, our journalism, and our education is all wrong. It would mean, in essence, that the Enlightenment model of how people change their opinions – through information-gathering and reasoned deliberation – is really a buttress for the status quo. It would mean that those who swear by rationality, nuance, and compromise fail to grasp how ideas govern the world.

The world will never be the same again. At that point in the conversation - and there are damned few conversations to be had right now, but nevertheless, at that point I tend to go a bit quiet. Because what I'm thinking is 'BULLSHIT'. (Which I'm too polite to say). 'Cos what I'm thinking is, actually, people have really, really short memories and those who haven't been left unemployed and homeless by the projected economic downturn will go back to Life As They Knew It, and in fact we'll have a sudden surge as everyone tries to catch up with all the holidays they missed and the stuff they didn't buy... Only this morning on German TV there was an idea that the car industry would need a government boost after the corona crisis (Really?!) Subsidies to encourage people to buy cars, and not, as was the case pre-pandemic, to encourage people to buy electric cars, no! The government proposes to use taxpayers' money to pay people to buy ANY kind of car. But then maybe the idea people are expressing is not so much a prediction as a fervent wish.And that is not bullshit, not at all, in fact it's reasonable and sensible, because, as Bregman points out in this dazzling work, a sudden shock CAN be a powerful instrument of change. The thing is though that the ideas for change have to already be flying around, like the famous roast chickens in Cockaigne, ready to be plucked from the air. I suppose the radical New Thinking that was gaining currency just before Covid 19 was Climate Change. And now we can all see that life still goes on with all planes grounded and minimal road traffic and a reduction in industrial manufacturing, and surprise! We get a reduction in CO2. Who'd have thought. But a total lockdown is not a viable model for the long term future, I imagine.So here are some ideas (nothing to do with the climate) to get us started in time for the NEXT crisis:1.

I'm a big fan of The Correspondent's journalism, and believe that basic income is an important idea whose time might have come. It was certainly interesting to learn more about the history, and the few studies that have been undertaken. Also fascinating to learn more about the history and failings of GDP as a measure.However the attempts to persuade seemed full of holes and contradictions. One minute the author is complaining about how technological progress has slowed to ""slightly improved iterations of the same phone we bought a couple of years ago"". The next he is championing how ""the average African with a cell phone has access to more information than President Clinton did in the 1990s"" and this fails to be reflected in GDP. On one page he's railing against ""bullshit jobs"" like HR managers (!*), then just a few pages later he's advocating a reformation of the education system to create more jobs for artists and philosophers. It's frustrating, especially when he's trying to sell such big and worthy ideas.* Maybe I would have agreed with him on this at one point, but if the past year or so has taught me anything it's that HR people are fucking important."

The modern creed – or worse, the belief that there’s nothing left to believe in – makes us blind to the shortsightedness and injustice that still surround us every day. To give a few examples: Why have we been working harder and harder since the 1980s despite being richer than ever? Why are millions of people still living in poverty when we are more than rich enough to put an end to it once and for all? And why is more than 60% of your income depends on the country where you just happen to have been born?24 Utopias offer no ready-made answers, let alone solutions. But they do ask the right questions.
I’ve had this on my TBR since 2017. Upon watching the viral video of Bregman at Davos berating the billionaires for not paying their fair share of taxes, I felt I had to read his book. For those of you who haven’t seen that short speech here it is https://www.theguardian.com/business/... .As you can tell from my rating, I’m very happy I read this book. It was riveting, informative, and most importantly, it challenged and changed some of my ideas. I love when this happens.Bregman is starting to be known as the “universal basic income guy”. I don’t know about you, in the past year or so I’ve come across some articles about this notion, half dismissing it as undoable. Upon reading this book, I’ve changed my mind. It sounds like a far-fetched idea until you read more about it.In the past, the economists and other people in the know were predicting the working week will be around 15 hrs by 2030. Obviously, it didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to, if anything, the opposite is true, especially for certain countries in the developed world, especially the USA, Japan, South Korea etc. But many of the more enlightened European countries are moving towards shorter and shorter weekly hours, the Netherlands is at the top with an average of 27.5 hrs/week followed very closely by Germany. Another thing that Bregman discusses in depth is poverty, homelessness and foreign aid to poor countries. I’m a proud and loud lefty, and even I have, better said, had, some misconceptions about poor people and poverty, and I was far from being one of those people who go on and on about “why don’t they just get a job and why do they keep having so many kids (well, I still think that about everyone – because of overpopulation) and they should stop drinking and smoking (I dislike drinking and smoking in everyone) etc. 
The big reason poor people are poor is because they don’t have enough money,” notes economist Charles Kenny, “and it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that giving them money is a great way to reduce that problem.
Those more sceptical will probably huff and puff at all these utopian ideals, but guess what, most good things we take for granted today, such as democracy, women’s right to vote, birth control, you name it, they were all considered “undoable”, “unnecessary” in the beginning. Somebody, usually on the fringes, had an idea, a vision. Look, I can go on and on about this book. It’s by no means perfect, but it gave me food for thought and it whetted my appetite to read more books/articles on such important issues. If you have any suggestions/links do let me know.Highly recommended"
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49368027-adrian-hon,3,"A reasonably good summary of the history of universal basic income and the drive to a shorter working week, although if you've read a few long essays on those topics it's unlikely you'll learn much. Unfortunately the book is spoiled by a few things. Firstly, while I get that it has a point of view that it's conveying (one that I agree with!), I could've done with more opposing arguments, if only to arm myself in future.Secondly, one of the arguments is for open borders, which the author suggests would have next to no ill effects - not even in the short term. True, he suggests phasing it them slowly, but it seems to be that there *would* be problems for some people, and to just say 'redistribution!' is not an answer. Finally, he goes off on a bizarre rant at the end against identity politics and the left ""wallowing in moral superiority"" to which I say, FUCK THAT NOISE. Racism and sexism are no small things and it's good that people are upset about them. And why can't the left walk and chew gum at the same time? Striving towards utopia requires true equality and it's a real black eye that this book ends in such a childish manner."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4440796-cristina,5,"Loved it. I'm going to share some of the excerpts I liked.1. Whether you look at the incidents of depression, burnout, drug abuse, high dropout rates, obesity, unhappy childhoods, low election turnout or social and political distrusts, the evidence points to the same culprit every time - inequality. But hold on -- what should it matter if some people are filthy rich if even those who are very poor are better off than the kings of centuries ago? A lot. Because it’s all about relative poverty. However wealthy a country gets, inequality always rains on the parade. Being poor in a rich country is a whole different story to being poor a couple centuries ago, when almost everybody, everywhere was a pauper. Take bullying. Countries with big disparities in wealth also have more bullying behavior because there are bigger status differences. (...) the psychosocial consequences are such that people living in unequal societies spend more time worrying about how others see them. This undercuts the quality of relationships, manifested in a distrust of strangers and status anxiety, for example. The resulting stress, in turn, is a major determinant of illness and chronic health problems. But shouldn’t we be more concerned with equal opportunities than with equal wealth? The fact is that they both matter. These two forms of inequality are inextricable. Just look at the global rankings -- when inequality goes up, social mobility goes down. There’s almost no country on earth where the American dream is less likely than come true than in the US of A. Anybody eager to work their way out from rags to riches is better off trying their luck in Sweden, where people born into poverty can still hold out hope of a brighter future. 2. Imagine this: A welfare mother has her income cut because she hasn’t developed sufficient job skills. The government saves a couple thousand bucks but the hidden costs of children who will consequently grow up poor, eat poor food, get poor grades at school, and be more likely to have a run-in with the law are many times greater. In fact, conservative criticism of the old nanny state hits the nail on the head. The current tangle of red tape keeps people trapped in poverty, it actually produces dependence. Whereas employees are expected to demonstrate their strengths, social services expect claimants to prove over and over that an illness is sufficiently debilitating and that chances at getting higher are sufficiently slim.3. Only Denmark has ever tried to quantify the value of breastfeeding in its GDP. In the US, the production of breastmilk has been estimated at an incredible 110 billion/year (!). About the size of China’s military budget. The GDP also does a poor job of calculating advances in knowledge. (...) If you were the GDP, your ideal citizen would be a drug addict who has cancer, goes through a divorce and pops fistfuls of Prozac and goes bezerk on Black Friday. Mental illness, pollution, crime - in terms of the GDP - the more, the better. That’s also why one of the countries with the highest per capita GDPs, the United States, also leads in social problems. By the standard of the GDP, the worst families in America are those that actually function as families, that cook their own meals, take walks after dinner, and talk together, instead of just farming the kids out to the commercial culture. We live in a world where the more vital your occupation - cleaning, nursing, teaching - the lower you rate in the GDP. 4. In overworked countries like Japan or the United States, people watch an absurd amount of television -- up to 5 hours a day in the US, WHICH ADDS UP TO 9 YEARS IN A LIFETIME. American children spend half more time in front of the TV as they do at school. True leisure, however, is neither a luxury nor a vice. It is as vital to our brains as vitamin C is to our bodies. There’s not a person in the world who on their deathbed thinks ‘had I only put in a few more hours at the office…’ or ‘sat in front of the Tube some more’. 5. Bullshit jobs. The economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we’d all be working just 15 hours a week by 2030. That our prosperity would shoot through the roof and we’d exchange a sizeable chunk of our wealth for leisure time. In reality, that’s not at all what has happened. We’re plenty more prosperous, but we’re not exactly swimming in a sea of free time -- quite the reverse. We’re all working harder than ever. In the previous chapter, I described how we sacrificed our free time on the altar of consumerism. Keynes certainly didn’t see that coming. But there’s still one puzzle piece that still doesn’t fit. Most people play no part in the production of iPhone cases, in their panoply of colors, exotic shampoos containing botanical extracts, or mocker cookie crumble frappuccinos. Our addiction to consumption is enabled mostly by robots and third-world wage slaves. And although agricultural and manufacturing production capacity have grown exponentially over the past decades, employment in these industries has dropped. So is it really true that our overworked lifestyle all comes down to out of control consumerism?David Graeber wrote a fascinating piece that pinned the blame not on the stuff we buy but on the work we do. It’s titled aptly ‘on the phenomenon of bullshit jobs’. In Graber’s analysis, innumerable people spend their entire working life doing jobs they consider to be pointless. Jobs like telemarketer, HR manager, social media strategist, PR advisor, and a whole host of administrative positions at hospitals, universities and government offices. Bullshit jobs, Graeber calls them. They’re the jobs that even the people doing them admit are, in essence, superfluous. 6. A mere 62 people are richer than 3.5 billion people in the world. (!!!)"
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,One of a spate of books to come out on the Basic Income idea to eliminate poverty and mitigate the coming automation economic crisis. I like the idea myself and the author marshalls studies to back up that a basic income would go a long way to reduce poverty. I am not sure that problem of a sense of purpose will be easier to tackle when robots start taking away large sectors of the labor force but it is better than letting people starve and the economy going to crap. the author also tackles the very large downsides to huge inequality in modern societies that lead to numerous pathologies. Definitely a good guide to the future of this argument.
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,2,"I was probably misguided as I thought this book would deal predominantly with the idea of a basic income. Specifically, i was intrested in the arguments pro and against it and, preferably, an analysis how it is possible to implement, the impact of automation and which steps might be taken right now. But this book is much broader in scope, and at the same time, pretty shallow. The book is more about the current state of the world with inequality, too much work for some and no for the others, the climate change etc.. It states that we need to have some new ideology to tackle these challenges. But it does not go far enough to define this ideology. It proposes 3 broad areas which hypothetically might improve the current state of the world:- basic income; - shorter work hours;- open borders;I am very sympathetic with all three of them. That was partly the reason why I’ve picked up this book. But though it provides the reader with some historic anecdotes, it does not go far enough to specify where are we specifically in terms of those 3 areas; and what has to be done to get us where we want to be. There are some interesting observations and facts. For example, there is a story how president Nixon was on the verge of introducing the basic income in the US but was stopped by another story of the nineteenth-century English Speenhamland plan. There is also information about the experiments in the 70s Canada and Seattle. But what about more current situation - not much! The main illustration is 13 homeless people in London in 2009. 9 of them apparently has reformed their ways (not sure what happened with another 6). There is no information about Swiss referendum on basic income (overwhelming rejected with 77% against) or the Finland experiment which is currently underway. They’ve just briefly mentioned at the end of the book. These discussions would be much more useful going forward than Nixon’s fiasco. It is not even totally clear whether the author proposes to replace all welfare state wth a regular lump sum payment (quite radical libertarian view) or he wants to give people money on the top of everything else.On the shorter work hours, quite a bit of a narrative is focused on criticising “bullshit jobs” (bankers of course, but also the lawyers (hopefully only the corporate ones), consultants, marketers etc - journalists as well?). vs very useful jobs of the NY cleaners. I am sure NY cleaners’ job satisfaction is great and they are all happy as ever. But would this very useful and fantastic job satisfy a bright young person on the basis of bringing the huge public value? I know that the bright kids should all start doing research how to solve the global problems instead of doing “bullshit jobs”. But the main question is “how” and “who would pay for it”? I did not find the answer in the book.The question of open borders is very close to my heart as i seriously believe in it. He is a bit more constructive. He defines 7 perceptive myths about the emigrants. And this discussion is a bit more concrete. But unfortunately, I did not find all of his debunking arguments very convincing. And in this case i cannot see how he can convince someone who is really against this idea. For example, he “debunks” the misconception that all immigrants are criminals. Specially, he talks about the youth crime of the second generation Maroccans in the Netherlands. Apparently, there is no correlation between the ethnicity and the levels of the criminal activity. But that was not the question! The question was is there a correlation between the status (second generation immigrant) and the criminal activity. It is not the same is it? I hope the answer is “no” as well. But such confusion undermines the whole credibility of the debate. And after all “debunking”, he is appeared to be not really very ambitions at all:“Opening our borders is not something we can do overnight, of course - not should it be. Unchecked migration would certainly corrode social cohesion in the Land of Plenty.” (That is after a few pages ago he debunked the misconception that the immigrants are undermining the social cohesion!”) So he is thinking just “making a crack in the door” - increase it on 3% (annually?) or something like that.I do not want to continue listing what i found unsatisfying about this book - you’ve got the picture. There are a lot of pathos and good rhetorics, but that is about it. Apart from a few interesting anecdotes and observations, it was useless for me. It definitely would not make you any wiser if you are interested to find out more about the current theory and practice in the area of basic income. And there are much better books on the state of the world. Even the latest Friedman’s endeavour is better Thank You for Being Late: An Optimist's Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations. "
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,5,"My father once told me that he felt I was very pessimistic, to which I replied that I was too much of a realist to be an optimist. Don’t get me wrong, when stuff is good, I am more than happy to celebrate it, but I’m also not the type to pretend everything is great when things are objectively terrible. The title “Utopia for Realists” grabbed me right away, because I’m pretty sure that if you ask any so-called realist, you’ll find they want nothing more than to believe the world could be a better place; they just can’t quite see how that might – realistically – happen.Rutger Bregman’s thesis of how to make the world a better place in a very concrete way is threefold: installing a basic universal income, putting the average working week at about 15 hours, and opening the borders. If you are the type that sees the Scandinavian model in a good light, you won’t need much convincing to hop on his bandwagon, but he’ll nevertheless illustrate his points with solid facts, detailed research and very convincing arguments. Considering that I am one of those weirdos who thinks everyone deserves to be healthy, well-fed, decently housed and properly educated, I found so many things in this book interesting and inspiring.Near the end of “Bullshit Jobs, A Theory” (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), David Graeber mentions the idea of universal basic income as one way to solve this economic and existential crisis that is the BS job conundrum. Bregman explores the concept to demonstrate that when people’s basic needs are met without them having to worry about how to pay the bills, they are happier, healthier and more productive members of their society – which stimulates their local economy much better that letting them live hand to mouth and burden the healthcare system because all they can afford is terrible food. The money from such programs is most often used to go to school, fix residences in need of repair, support a family member’s parental leave and start small businesses. One his of key points in addressing the various ways we can reduce and even eliminate poverty is that when you take care of people, either by giving them cash or putting a roof over their heads, the state saves money and wealth is created. Ergo, all of society stands to benefit (side note: with the pandemic, I think the need for that kind of universal basic income is more obvious than ever because no one should put their or their family’s health and lives at risk to pay the bills).Bregman also sides with Graeber (he actually refers to his work in this section) on the topic of working fewer hours for greater productivity and a heathier amount of leisure – and thus time to do things that make life more enjoyable and meaningful. He addresses the “crisis” of automation, the disparity between what I’ll call useful jobs and somewhat less useful jobs.I learned a lot in his section about opening up the borders. I recently read a book that mentions the absolutely terrible practice of human trafficking, and how a lot of border and economic regulations make such a practice almost unavoidable (see “McMafia” https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). Bregman looks at all the usual opposition to open borders, and why the overwhelming majority of them make no sense.By the time the book wrapped up, I could see how his three suggestions were the most logical and sane ways to eliminate poverty and generally fix a lot of systemic problems that trickle down into all of our lives. Following his recommendation would not lead to a perfect world, but it would certainly improve it significantly, and more importantly, communally.I appreciate that Bregman didn’t waste time or ink bashing his ideological opponents. Most books about making the world a better place tend to fill many pages describing why the conservatives are wrong and how terrible they are and offer very little in the way of concrete ideas, and this book is the refreshing opposite to that. I doubt that anyone picking it up needs to be convinced that people who think the poor are lazy are wrong, anyway. His tone is conversational, easy to follow and understand even if you don’t have a degree in economics – and he’s often quite funny. And sure, some elements are depressing to read about (like the story of how Nixon’s basic income bill was shot down by Randians using falsified science…), but those are things we need to talk about and think about if anything is going to change. The hardest thing, as he points out, is changing the way we think about certain problems. Cognitive dissonance is one of the biggest hurdle to overcome if the world is to change for the best.One has to be fair and acknowledge Bregman’s euro-centric bias; he clearly thinks that the USA is a failed experiment (and this book was published 4 years ago, so heaven knows his opinion can’t possibly have improved). It doesn’t really matter that I agree with him, but it has to be kept in mind while reading this book. He also clearly hates bankers – another sentiment I can understand, but that nevertheless colors parts of his analysis.Overall, a very interesting, easy to read and understand, engaging and ultimately hopeful book about the world we could have.

We could be realizing the world predicted by 20th c thinkers.Subtitled ""How We Can Build The Ideal World,"" Utopia for Realists is an international best seller, first published in the Netherlands where it ignited a debate and inspired a movement.Bregman begins by reminding us of how recently life was a ""vale of tears,"" ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short,"" as philosophers wrote in the 16th c. With the explosion of new technology and prosperity over the last two hundred years, humanity has achieved a standard of living that Medieval folk would consider Utopia; indoor heat and cooling, flush toilets and clean water alone would make them marvel. So would obesity from an overabundance of easily obtained food, the magical ability to protect ourselves from smallpox and polio, and paved roads we travel at 70 mph--without fear of highwaymen robberies.Have we reached Utopia? Or is there something we can do to make life even better? How can we solve the problems that remain: fearfulness, unemployment, quality of life, poverty. The welfare state 'from a bygone era' doesn't work today. Globalization and the cost of higher education have impacted the stability of the Middle Class. Upward mobility for the poor no longer happens.Bregman wants to ""fling open the windows of our minds"" to discover ""a new lodestar."" He presents studies and experiments about how we treat the homeless and the poor and challenges our traditional mindset that people are to be blamed for their own poverty--they just have to work hard and save. We have created welfare programs for those in need, which are costly and do not solve the basic problem. What happened to the expectation of the 15-hour workweek? Why are we spending more time working, impacting our health and our families?Bregman wants us to dream new dreams and embrace ideas that can change the world for the better. Thinking outside the box has made a difference: abolition, universal voting rights, and same-sex marriage, he reminds, were all once considered impossible. All it takes is ""a single opposing voice.The basis of Bregman's new Utopia is a guaranteed basic income. He presents studies that demonstrate the success of such programs. In 1967 universal basic income was supported by 80% of Americans and President Nixon submitted a bill to eradicate poverty.Other changes he offers include shorter work hours, proven to increase productivity, reconsidering the importance of the Gross Domestic Product as our economic standard of success, improving quality of life, open borders, taxing capital instead of labor, and adjusting salary to a job's societal value. At a time when productivity is a record levels, there are fewer jobs and lower salaries. ""We have to devise a system to ensure that everybody benefits,"" he writes.There is an old saying: Insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. Instead of holding more tightly to the old ways we need to envision innovation. Perhaps books like this will spur discussions and reevaluations.One can only hope.I received a free ebook from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."

This book reaches (runs into?) its limits…The Good:--Top marks for accessibility; engaging writing-style especially for Western audiences, like that of David Graeber and Matt Taibbi. --Dutch historian Bregman joins Development economist Ha-Joon Chang as leading Social Democrats; highlights from this book:1) UBI, automation, reducing work, and bullshit jobs: the core of the book, with engaging historical narrative and case studies. Also, useful chapter breaking down GDP (origins in war production capacity). Speaking of jobs, Green New Deal is missing here... 2) Open borders: this was the brightest highlight for me, as imperialism is my top critique of Social Democrats. --Bregman had me convinced he would spiral down the imperialist path by starting the chapter with “foreign aid”. Yes, within the framework of foreign aid, the process of using randomized controlled trials instead of intuition that Bregman details is transformative. But anyone who takes a step back and considers the big picture/magnitude of the world’s political economy, who considers imperialism (a word omitted by Social Democrats), understands that “foreign aid” is trivial compared to the systemic unequal exchange in the global division of labor. Some Social Dems engage with unequal exchange, like Ha-Joon Chang: Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism). Furthermore, challenges to unequal exchange are frequently met with starvation (economic sanctions) and bloodshed (funding terrorism, military interventions). ""Foreign aid"" has no place in a book on utopia.--Thus, Bregman suddenly changing gears by saying ""foreign aid"" is actually low on the economic food chain and supporting “open borders” was most unexpected. I wish he used the entire chapter to fully unpack “open borders”, particularly its economic myths. Still, Bregman tops my Social Dems list for this. 3) How do ideas change the world? Learn from the bad guys: Bregman uses the example of neoliberal think-tank Mont Pelerin Society (Hayek, Friedman) first setting the ideological groundwork, then the OPEC stagflation crisis allowing Thatcher/Reagan regimes to implement these ideas; slick way to tie this book together. No more “underdog socialism”, utopia is about dreaming big and winning. The Bad/Missing:--Social Democrats believe in the contradiction of democracy (one-person-one-vote) and capitalism (one-dollar-one-vote). How does someone pushing utopia still cling onto ""capitalism"" so fervently? Here, I will try an alternate approach to the Marxist surplus value exploitation argument: let us break down the key components of the economy, and you tell me how much ""capitalism"" belongs in utopia:1) Banking: this is where economics begins, going into debt to secure the capital required. Bregman lambastes bankers as parasitic on numerous occasions, but only offers regulations in response. That requires States powerful enough and willing to side with the public over private bankers. How does he not bring up public banking?! Why is credit not treated as a public utility? Why do we continue to give a cartel of private bankers the privilege to create money out of nothing (credit), lend feverishly until the bubble bursts, and get bailed out by taxpayers? People already distrust bankers; you do not need to shatter the heroic private profit-seeker fantasy with them. To explore:-The Public Bank Solution: From Austerity to Prosperity-Where Does Money Come From?: A Guide To The Uk Monetary And Banking System2) Monopolies/cartels: for natural monopolies like natural resources/utilities and many large-scale industries, these are already centrally-planned; they should be made public and operated democratically (worker cooperatives). If machines become so vital to the society, why continue to keep them in so few private hands and rely on States powerful enough to regulate this? Information technology further erodes private ownership: Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future. Worker co-ops further democracy into the workplace, a step towards economic democracy/participatory economics, instead of restricting democracy to political theater spectatorship (vote...). --If we stop here, the economy can no longer be described with the single word “capitalism”. Debate small businesses elsewhere, the productivity of the modern economy is built on banks and cartels of multinational corporations. --Overall avoidance of power relations/imperialism/class analysis leads to illusory reliance on State redistribution of private accumulation (and extremely concentrated at that!). Similarly, war is described as extremely costly and wasteful. But, as Michael Parenti reminds us to ask, cui bono?! (https://youtu.be/O8k0yO-deoA?t=26) ...These wars preserve capitalist profits, protecting the layers of power politics that unequal exchange resides on. Once again the proposed solution is State regulation, in this case taxing harmful externalities. Keep chasing the tail, keep faith in the gospel of private innovation (even Social Dems can point out innovation from public sector R&D). Social production but private accumulation has no place in utopia.--Lingering tone of Eurocentric history, “progress” (a Dutch historian, can you believe it).

I've been trying my best to broaden my understanding of not only the problems facing the world, but reasonable solutions. Utopia for Realists proposes three concepts (universal basic income, a 15-hour work week, and open borders) that often come up during political debates for which I had little opinion prior to reading.Fortunately, I caught a cool talk at a pediatric conference discussing the benefits of eradicating poverty on child health that seemed to agree with a lot of what Bregman is suggesting. It was refreshing to hear material I often find dull spun into a message which I could easily appreciate. Though the main impediment seems to be well-worth ruts of political thought, it's hopeful to read optimistic messages that others openly share. It was also great to read Bregman's well-written and mostly colloquial language for what can quickly become a jargon-filled info dump.On a more personal level, this just isn't the type of thing that I live for. I mean, the concepts, sure, but it is not my favourite reading experience. Science writing, autobiography, and true crime tend to be my nonfiction niches and I found myself easily glazing over during extended reading. Though everything is well explained, I wasn't gripped by the historical fact the way some readers might be.In summary: a short primer that is an occasional snooze."

19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,4,"I ended up really liking this book. It explores a lot of ideas that we reflexively reject, likely because they go against common sense. Ideas like ""just give poor people cash"" seem not only politically infeasible, but unwise. And sadly, our politics is dictated by soundbites and conventional wisdom, and we wonder why we only dig ourselves deeper into wealth inequality and dissatisfaction with government at all levels.This book explores concepts like universal basic income, open borders, and cash substitutes for our current forms of welfare/charity, in a way that makes me hopeful they might one day be implemented on a large scale, or at least experimented with. Not that ideas that make all the sense in the world for our peer countries have ever really prodded the United States into action--see, e.g., universal healthcare and noninterventionist military policy--but I might be able to dust off that Irish passport and decamp for one of the more enlightened countries once this one starts to really tear itself apart.Lest I leave it on that unsavory note, I wonder whether the silver lining from this Trump administration might just be that we are so screwed up or have such a political mandate that trying these things out becomes palatable, if not necessary. I just wonder why--when one political party is trying to drag us backward and the other one, overly proud of its respectability, insists on keeping us in stasis--there isn't more of a yen for something radical and outside the box. Here's hoping more of the 2020 candidates trade on the yen for something different and begin exploring these things through their platforms. Even if they don't implement them, this book correctly notes that the Overton Window would be shifted thereby. "

If you've already read about Universal Basic Income (UBI), or really anything by a good myth-busting economist which challenges our current era of capitalism, then Utopia for Realists may not teach you too much that you don't already know. Overall Rutger Bregman''s way is just to summarize some main big ideas into a readable paperback, and yet that is the whole point. There are plenty of graphs which will convince the reader that income inequality is a leading social problem, and even some surprising historical examples of how realistic giving away free money to alleviate poverty would be. (The now famous Nixon example! And Speenhamland, what an unfortuante misinterpretation ... Bregman is primarily a historian after all.) So read up to learn why value shouldn't actually be measured by a nation's GDP, and about how arbitrary it is that neoliberalism won out in the end because it could have gone so many other ways. Yet most of all, take this hopefully-important book as a manifesto. A call to stop accepting that the way it is now is the way it has to be, and instead embrace these valid possibilities for new utopias. That is ultimately the point. The world has changed for the better before, and it can change for the better again. In bigger ways than we think. This in essence is what's being called for, to inspire leaders and citizens to have more ambition and actually improve everyone's lives. Really, if we can't think harder about how to make life better then what's the point of civilization? I truly hope this book fulfils such potential and does have that big an impact, I really do. Therefore, of course, very recommended for everyone in the world to read. "

Take physics for example, you simply CAN NOT write anything on the topic if you don't have the credentials, first of all, no one will publish it and then even if it's published, people will bash it to oblivion. But somehow it's okay if it's economics. You can right the most idealistic, unscientific, batshit insane things and there will be people who eat it up. This is just sad.

24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,5,"Utopia for Realists: How we Can Build the Ideal World, by Rutger Bregman, is a fascinating book about the idea of Utopia in a modern, realistic context. Early concepts of Utopia revolved around basic needs; food falling from the sky, safety and health, and so on. Bregman says we are there already. Food is no longer scarce in most countries, and poverty rates and crime is down globally - to the lowest levels in history. Instead, many nations are grappling with other issues - overwork, obesity, lack of leisure time, economic inequality that is reaching levels not seen since medieval times... and so on. How is society to tackle these issues? Bregman makes a few strong arguments, chiefly, a guaranteed annual income. This idea has been experimented and trialed before, notably in Canada and the US, with countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands tinkering with the idea of making it national policy. Bregman argues that giving people money with no strings attached in actually more efficient, encourages growth and productivity, and so much more. Bregman notes numerous studies and trials of monetary transfers like this. One notable example is a trial in London, England, where 13 homeless ""frequent flyers"" - in and out of hospitals, jail etc. - were given 3000 pounds flat out, no strings attached. Before, these 13 had been costing the state around 400000 pounds a year (yes, that much) in legal fees, jail costs, healthcare costs, social services costs, and so on. in comparison, 3000 pounds is a very small percentage of their total yearly cost to the taxpayer. This money made a huge impact on the lives of these 13 - in a small period of time, some had enrolled in courses, some were working, some in rehab, and some in new housing. Numerous other studies are cited within the book, pointing to the benefits of basic income and disproving many of the criticisms. Bregman argues that basic income does not make people lazy, but instead motivates them to go back to school, start small businesses, engage in creative passions, and just enjoy life a bit more. After all, nobody regrets not spending enough time at the office on there death beds. Instead, they regret not spending enough time with family and friends, or not pursuing their passions. Bregman's book is refreshing for a few reasons; first and foremost is the hopeful, upbeat tone. So many political books coming out in modern times are negative. They purport ideas that have little meaning, say almost nothing, and offer no innovation or invention in the field. So many jobs these days - as Bregman quotes, are bullshit. People's lives lack meaning. But this can all be easily changed by opening the door to a few innovative ideas. Basic income. Shorter work weeks. Paying public service workers like nurses, teachers, garbage collectors etc. more money, and paying lobbyists, corporate lawyers and hedge fund managers less. Encouraging banks to hold more assets. And so on. This book is fascinating, simple in conception, and very interesting. It is certainly a recommended read for those looking for a good introduction to the idea (not the quantitative analysis) of basic income. It is also a left leaning book that is not disparaging to the right, and has respect for other fields, ideologies and ideas. A great book. "

A few counterintuitive examples (which I like and enjoy) that changed the way I think about work and finance. n.b: if you take one thing from this book or review let it be this- 'Read the Epilogue'. It's good!In an ideal world we'd have this utopia (obviously!) but due to the narrowmindedness of low-information voters and their politicians (whom they think are looking out for them! Ha!) it's highly doubtful we'll see UBI succeed, let alone implemented. If it wasn't for the Koch-style Dark Money (from the ridiculous Citizens United SC decision - which maybe before 2030 will be overturned) and the nutty idealogues I might be more hopeful and optimistic. Unfortunately the damage is done and will take a long time to undo and recover. Nothing changed after the Panama Papers and now the Paradise Papers on tax havens, some entities (let's stop calling them humans or people, they're not like us) are just evil (and let's start just using the simple definition which is 'stopping the flow of good') and in that evil there is selfishness and greed of which magnitudes we've not seen in modern history (OK well the Gilded Age of the 1920s was a different time and inequality today is greater by most standards given that women can vote and work today). It's cringey seeing people that are outraged at inequality and yet are spending their hard earned money on products that go to funding and furthering tax cheats and inequality. The average person lacks insight, their ego is supreme. I just laugh at people that use Apple and Nike products, especially when they claim to be 'woke'. One day or some day I just pity them. I have given up gently pointing out how their market choices affect everyone and there are ethical options out there, perhaps I should just ignore it or find other ways. It's long past time caring or getting upset about it. The more things change, the more they stay the same - as the saying goes.

It changed my way of thinking: I didn't even know I was thinking this way until Rutger Bregman put his finger on the problem and showed me the way (okay, it sounds preachy told like this, but it's not!) I wanted to read this book because I wanted to believe there is more to this world than just the actual situation. I live in France, and it's not that glorious, be it personal or national. When I stumbled upon Utopia for Realists, I told myself: ""Well, why not? It can't harm me after all!"" Well, it could. Because this book is both depressing and motivating. First, depressing because the state of the world can't be but depressing, be it considering the situation in occidental countries or the one in African ones. We could have ended the poverty long ago, and even if we are far wealthier than in ""ancient times"", we are not happier. We are stuck in this that we can't go back to our former values, to what really matters in life, because we don't know how, or if we're allowed to. But, it's also super motivating, because, after finishing this book, I wanted to make things work like never before. I saw (warning, it's get dramatic) the light at the end of the tunnel. We can go out of this situation. We can make things better. It's in our hands! Otherwise, it is well written and fluid, the author explains things really well and he gives ALL his sources! There is nothing he says without quoting a book, an article, a study, and giving the reference for the reader to check, or to learn more about the topic! (so, I (obviously!) added some other books to my TBR!) Sometimes, it is quite light, which is refreshing considering the topic! Honestly, I really think everyone should read this book: we could really do something all together and it would clearly be a win-win situation for everyone!

Imagine a pandemic hitting states who's citizens receive an universal basic income, securing their livelihood!In ""Utopia for Realists"" Rutger Bregman argues for his three visions for the future: a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a universal basic income for everyone. Unfortunately the introduction of this book is really weak with enumerating inventions and conditions of our present to state under which high standards we would be living, desperately lacking reflection. He talks for example about medical technology enabling patients with spinal cord injuries to walk again but completely fails to mention, that health insurance companies refuse to provide them to patients due to high costs, that people are getting older due to medical care, but under conditions that are ethically questionable to say the least, or that the number of people committing suicide are three times as high as deaths from vehicle accidents. He does recognize depression though, which according to him is caused by our inability to imagine anything better than what we already have. I highly contradict that. Thankfully he then turns around and starts to recognize, that the empowerment of the individual doesn't just lead to more freedom but a constant feeling of failure when not being able to live up to the expectations.After this disappointing introduction he turns to the universal income for everyone where it get‘s interesting. He lingers between anecdote, academic research and statistics and highlights examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in the past. For example how a universal basic income was almost introduced in the United States under Nixon, or how a Canadian basic annual income program barely dented the enthusiasm for work, but let to a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty. I believe that this topic needs to be on our politics agendas! I agree that the costs that we invest in our social system aren‘t just completely ineffective but also contra-productive. Because of our current pandemic we can‘t close our eyes to these options anymore and which consequences it would have if we already would have considered it!In the second part of the books he introduces his vision for a 15 hour work week in 2030, because our economy would be that wealthy, that no more was required. Even though he dedicates an entire chapter to it, he somehow fails to connect it to the basic income model. Also it completely ignores the variety of work fields, which seems ironic to me because he deprecates the work fields the biggest part of our society works in, as being unproductive, replaceable and unable to provide any value to society. Such as lawyer, bankers,economists,companies,media...vs. doctors, fire fighter, farmers. Those who would actually produce. But particularly in those areas, work times are in important factor of the ability to produce in the first place and practice is gained by long periods of training. While the concept wouldn't apply to self employers to begin with, those who would be able to instantly instate the concept are those the author diminishes.He then argues for a world without borders, which probably shows the biggest lack of reflection. More people migrating freely would require more energy, leading to more jobs, which is why they would start to produce more and ultimately invest more money back into the economy. But about which jobs are were talking about here? Particularly the jobs the author valued above as the only ones of worth require decades of education in difficult fields. Not only do they require a high level of adaption to our language to say the least, the areas themselves are also not able to adapt to sudden changes in requirements as well. Our current situation teaches us what happens, if there are suddenly more patients than ventilators available to us, but the same goes for housing, food production etc. Open borders always would be influences by sudden movements caused by political actions, natural catastrophes and poverty, it wouldn't just be a gradual floating state. And just as important: What about culture differences? What about religious believes that collide? What about language barriers? What about geographical space limitations? What about different legal systems? What about border controls in order to provide safety for let‘s say outbreaking viruses or prosecution? The author really couldn't convince me of this idea.A very thought provoking book. I obviously don‘t agree with a big part of what the author says but these topics need to be discussed. Particularly the basic income.PS: For me stars are a measurement of impact rather than liking. A five star book isn‘t necessarily one I entirely agree with, but can also mean that it provoked me to think intensely and forced me to form strong opinions, which can‘t even be measured in stars and is one of the main purposes I read books to begin with."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"This is a well-written, well-articulated treatise on the Utopian ideals of a shorter work week, a Universal Basic Income, and other rights for working class people.Unfortunately, although the author wrote well and supported the ideas with a wealth of statistics, there isn't really much new here. Social progressives have held these ideals for years--as Bregman himself demonstrates in his historical references to earlier experiments for the UBI--but society never seems to get any closer to realizing them. I had hoped the author would review these concepts and then explain in detail how to go about attaining them in practice, given that governments continually see overwhelming data of their merit but consistently fail to act.Bregman does briefly look at this stumbling-block near the end of the book in the chapter of How Ideas Change the World. As he states,The question is not CAN new ideas defeat old ones; the question is HOW.Other than reminding us that crises can often drive larger changes than small tentative, rational steps, Bregman disappointing has little to offer. This is a shame, especially given the current world crisis with Covid, where there do seem to be some current openings to such ideas. But without some strong leaders pointing the way, we instead seem destined to return to a (perhaps slightly newer) normal that may prove to be negligibly different than the recent status quo. Sadly, it seems built into human nature to be unable to change our minds and behaviours, even when the best evidence is staring us directly in the face. I deeply wish Bregman had a better answer and could have prescribed some more proactive steps forward.That said, the book is an important read, especially for those unfamiliar with the progressive Utopian concepts, such as a Universal Basic Income that historically has good hard data supporting its implementation. It is sad that Bregman somewhat infers in his own text that those who need to read and absorb the information will never do so."

The best example he gives is the contrasting strikes of garbage collectors in New York in 1968 which brought that great city to its knees in ten days ( leaving 100, 000 tons of trash on the streets ) and that of bank workers in Ireland two years later, who the country managed without for six months with almost no effect on the nation's economy.Bergman, and his translator, write with clarity and concision and his arguments are based entirely on facts and numbers, but this doesn't mean it lacks passion."

Secondly, they are embedded in an ideological position that the reader can’t get along with, so it’s dismissed out of hand. Thirdly, the argument isn’t as coherent as it could be (partly because of the first and second points) so closer readers will find flaws within moments and miss some of the more salient points.I’m glad to say that this work doesn’t fall prey to those things. Firstly, while simplified, the ideas presented are relatively straight-forward and so they don’t need to be more complicated for its purpose. The author has written more academic work which can be explored, or he points in the direction of those texts that you should look into. It’s textbook stuff: make a point, show how your point might be wrong, defend your point. Job done.Likewise, there’s no clear ideological baggage here. It’s true that he defends neoliberalism (unashamedly) and has a dig at a current strand of defeatist socialism, but throughout the book we have equal nods given to Marx and Engels, the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and a host of neoliberals that he doesn’t agree with. His point is not that neoliberalism and capitalism are the only games in town. He’s simply stating that neoliberalism can’t be used as a derogatory word when it can be used to do the same job as anti-capitalist positions (if done well). Finally, the argument is coherent and where he runs into dead ends, there is a clear acknowledgement of those problems. Obviously the biggest issue is not what to do but how to get politicians to do it- but that’s true of any book of philosophy, economics or politics that tries to do something radical.This book is hopeful because it shows us how the major changes we need to eradicate world poverty, produce more equality and produce a better quality of life are actually simple. It also reminds us that with enough push, the impossible can become actual. It’s really odd that his ideas echo so many points made by Zizek, despite their huge differences. Bergman is anti-high theory, anti-ideology and less critical of free markets than Zizek, whereas Zizek is entrenched in theory, admits we cannot avoid ideology and is highly critical of capitalism at every turn. However, both argue similar points: the belief that minor changes can be made to capitalism seems like Utopianism, pie-in-the-sky navel gazing nonsense, but all big ideas seemed this way at some point; ultimately, with the absence of a true change of the entire system, we have to radically change what already exists; the revolution is a revolution of ideas and thinking, not of seizing land and machines; Utopianism is not an end state, but a way of thinking- always with that expanding horizon in the distance; and finally, that the left enjoys defeat and has begun to identify with it too much. It’s nice to see two incredibly opposed individuals finding two ways of making the same points. Read it. This book is vital. Even if you don’t agree totally (from either a pro-capitalist or pro-socialist standpoint) you’ll find something in here to make you radically reassess what you already think."

The world seems so depressing at the moment, with the likes of Trump and Brexit and what feels to me like a constant threat of impending doom (maybe that's just my anxiety speaking!) This book reminds you that we are living RIGHT NOW in an incredible utopia compared to where we were in the past. This is the best time to be alive in human history. And what's more, there could be an even brighter future with equality for all and the abolition of poverty across the globe, if only we would dare to dream.I loved the ideas in it, which include universal basic income, a shorter worker week, and open borders, each of which he discusses at length. Open borders, in particular, is seriously radical, but morally his argument is sound - borders are a form of global apartheid! How terrible is it that your chances in life are determined by where you are born. We allow everything else to move freely about the world, but not people.I found it really interesting how major political movements tend only to occur after a crisis (before this happens, politicians will only suggest things that don't stray too far from the status quo), and how neoliberalism, for example, came into fruition after the Arab oil crisis in the 70s thanks to decades of simmering (a group of thinkers had been discussing it at length since the 30s). However after the 2008 crash which proved that that it wasn't infallible, there were no radical alternative ideas brewing (!) so we've stuck with the same flawed model. Thinking up and discussing new ideas is CRITICAL to moving forward.I loved the section on 'underdog' socialism, because it's so true! One of the successes of Trump's campaign is that he knows that people like to be on the 'winning' side and yet the branding of the left is all, 'sigh - welfare is expensive but a moral must' (basically, 'we're morally right but an economic disaster') whereas in fact the ideas the author discusses not only eradicate inequality and poverty but result in astonishing economic success. This is the message the voters need to hear.If you're thinking this is too good to be true, I get that. There was a stage in the book where even I - a total ignoramus - felt the arguments were naively optimistic, along the lines of, 'these ideas are the solution to everything and have no down sides', and I guess I was looking for more of a critical analysis, but towards the end I felt reassured that his work is rooted in extensive research, and that he himself is aware of the dangers of bias (he discusses this, including cognitive dissonance, in later chapters and gives an example of his own).In any case, a vision is a vision, and it should be radical. I loved his. I want to live in that world. And it actually feels feasible! Let's do this, people!Definitely read this book!"

I then found out that Rutger Bregman was also a real writer, and he told off the fuckers at Davos too. So let's have a look, I thought.First, he presents his ideas well, and presents them honestly, and I can certainly agree with all of his prescriptions, which, as a democratic socialist, shouldn't be surprising. My only regret is that his analysis is a bit skin-deep at points. He diagnoses several of the symptoms of late-stage capitalism correctly, and provides cures for those symptoms, but what of the underlying disease? A UBI could be disastrous if applied from a libertarian rather than a socialist perspective, and as for open borders, there's a difference between actual open borders (good idea, but it needs a phase-in) and Koch Brothers-styled open borders (like how a Romanian working in Germany can still legally be paid Romanian wages by a German employer). Simply put, good effort Rutger, but you'll need a bit more depth if you wanna achieve top Marx (sorry, couldn't resist)."

I found it interesting how often the book discussed the US even though the author is not American. Reading this was so pleasant what with its talk of UBI, open borders, 15 hour work weeks, and the eradication of poverty, but then of course I had to go back to the real world and the clusterfuck we call the current political situation (bombs, war, border walls, eradication of human rights, elimination of healthcare, deportations, growing inequality) and I just can't understand why anyone would think this mess is the best we can do."

49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31449816-zainab,4,"Using a primarily economic analysis, this book imagines a much more equal world – one that seems so near yet so far. Just as it says on the tin, this world is utopic but completely achievable. Rutger Bregman uses statistics and studies to expose the flaws of existing national budgets and priorities. His book is a fairly short read/listen that focuses mainly on the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and “bullshit jobs”, as well as poverty and foreign aid. It also envisions what a future of leisure could look like for society. The text is written in a straightforward way, which is unsurprising as Bregman spends the final chapter critiquing an “aristocratic” left, or “underdog socialism”, which he argues is not accessible to a wider public and not invigorated with enough hope to catch on. I found it to be a useful listen with some compelling and entirely convincing arguments, particularly on tax evasion and open borders.However, for me, the book also felt like a repeat of many podcasts I listened to around the UK General Election of 2019 and a few years prior. UBI as the logical future and GDP as a farce are very familiar ideas. In fact, much of what Bregman imagines was proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto, ideas which a global pandemic might help bring to reality. In addition, the book still felt quite Euro-centric in the framing of history/ideas, so it’s difficult to imagine, for instance, how a mineral-rich and currently impoverished country would transact within this utopia. The climate crisis, for me, also deserved a much more detailed mention in this imagined future. Rutger Bregman went viral alongside Winnie Byanyima at the Davos Conference of 2019 for confronting the billionaire tax evaders sitting before him. His book, Utopia for Realists, will explain why he knew what he was talking about."
50,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Let us be unreasonable and impossible, the author exhorts. But his book, short and sweet, is far from either. The idea of basic income fits into the paradigm of a realistic utopia, according to Rutger Bregman, whose penchant for popularizing penmanship and knack for narration keep the book interesting and informative, if not all that original. The book is best understood as an attempt to bring a whole bundle of progressive ideas into the mainstream, borrowing heavily from other classics. But what the book lacks in originality it makes up for in holistic vision.One of the most refreshing parts of the book is that the author does not demonize his political opponents, such as conservatives. And indeed, most of his strident criticisms are directed at his fellow leftists (""underdog socialists"") whom he accuses of wallowing in reactionary pessimism. As someone who is more libertarian economically, I found his criticism of the banking and the financial sectors to be embarrassingly misguided, although not any more so than your average left liberal economist. (He confuses corporatist kleptocracy with free markets.) And his implicit call for more regulation of the labour markets relies on a notion of collectivistic economic planning that confuses ideal theory with the predictable failure of public policy - thus betraying his own allegiance to REALISTIC utopias. Furthermore, Bregman's utopia seems too static and degrowth to really feel alive in the way that realistic utopians must live and grow.But overall I enjoyed his vision. The future belongs to those who can envision alternative possibilities and find the institutional means to bring them account. Universal Basic Income is a way to marry progressive and libertarian politics, and ""Utopia for Realists"" does a good job of showing the kind of vision that it inspires - even if there is still room for more realism in the mix."

It has stirred whole communities into action and wars have been fought over it. In this book, the author proposes a Utopia; the idea of a society where every individual is guaranteed a minimum basic income. No strings attached. I'm generally positive about such redistribution schemes, especially in light of the near future (AI, automation etc) but how do we pay for it? The author points out that we already spend an enormous amount in the war on poverty and social assistance programs. Eliminating this bureaucracy and red tape could save us a tremendous amount and make things more efficient at the same time. However, it won't be enough. A better way to think about this is to see it as an investment in humans. When humans can meet their basic needs, they can be more selective about which jobs they will sell their time and bodies to. They can take time off and invest in themselves. In a nutshell, we can eliminate poverty, redistribute wealth, and give people more agency in their lives. Well, what's the evidence that this can actually work? The author points out the example of Dauphin, a Canadian city where a minimum basic income experiment (the no strings attached kind) was tried out for 4 years and resulted in a drastic reduction in poverty and reduced hospitalisation rates. Honestly, I'd like more such experiments but the fact is that they're expensive and the results often take years to become visible. All in all, a perspective changing book."

The general population is increasingly disillusioned by the trickle-down economics in the Reagan era, and pushed into the ideal of equality. While the book presented many great statistics, evidences, and insights (compiled from many different sources), it presented a few weak arguments. And through the weak argument is where the author's intellectual elitism wafts out of the writing. The author considers himself to be an arbiter of value, despite being minimally trained in economics. Somehow careers such as financial services that involves studying efficient capital allocation or corporate councils who protect the legal integrity are pointed out as bullshit jobs, all the while artists, philosophers and social study group champions are the true creators of wealth and drivers of economy. I'm not against the idea of wealth redistribution, but discounting the drive and ambition of educated professionals, and forcefully assigning high economic value to liberal disciplines, shows that not only does the author have a very limited understanding of economics, but also the left-wings' resistance of something as basic as free market.

Bregman gives a list of new (though mostly old) ideas that seem counter-intuitive, but he presents them in a way that also makes them logical, sensible and doable. I recently saw a photo of Rupert Murdoch reading this book while lounging beside a swimming pool - perhaps so that he could work out how to prevent anything in it from happening.

It was pretty obvious that this started out as a book about UBI and the other issues were kind of tacked on, as they weren't as well researched or explained. There was also the long section on the economy and GDP that I didn't really need, because it didn't really help me understand the economy any better (I never will) and it was pretty long.This book was first published in 2014 in the Netherlands (I think), so there are some things that are more optimistic than I would be today. Also, a lot of the book focuses on the US, and it talks about inequality, but barely discusses race at all, which I think was a gross oversight. It's impossible to talk about inequality in the US without at least a cursory mention of the history of race. At one point, it used the US as a positive example for immigration bc of how the country was ""founded"" and all of the progress its made, which is great and all, but the mass immigration to this country wasn't so great for the people who were already here, so it's kind of a bad take, bro.I appreciated the last chapter's acknowledgement of studies that oppose the policies discussed in the book and how differing views can often entrench us further into a belief. I thought it made some interesting points about how change is actually achieved: laying groundwork for a policy and then a crisis activates it by showing that the new system would handle it better. Change can't be made if there's no alternative offered before the crisis, which is what happened in 2008. I think that mindset is especially relevant during present day's actual crisis and just hoping that we've laid some kind of groundwork for the change.Notes and Quotes:- ""you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots."" -Joseph Hanlon- 80% of Americans were pro-UBI in the 60s- Henry Ford giving all his employees big raises in 1914: aww, sweet. him doing it bc then they'd be able to afford his cars: figures- “the inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not the impossibility of change”- ""... what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? what's the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation?"""

Eləcə də biznes mütəxəssislərin böyük əksəriyyəti vəzifələrinin bir o qədər də əhəmiyyətli olmadığını düşünür. Biz acığımız gələn iş yerlərində bütün günü işlədikdən sonra bizə lazım olmayan şeyləri almağa başlayırıq. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya""da holland tarixçi və jurnalist Rutqer Breqman, bunların heç də belə olmamalı olduğunu qeyd edir. Beynəlminəllik və praqmatizm manifesti kimi Breqmanın kitabı əsas 3 ideya ətrafında formalaşıb: 15 saatlıq iş həftəsi, ""universal minimal gəlir"" və sərhədlərin olmadığı dünya. Bu iddialara dəstək məqsədi ilə kitabda ötən əsrin 70-ci illərində icra edilən ""Mincome"" təcrübəsi, evsizlərə verilən qarşılıqsız pul təcrübələri və müxtəlif çoxsayılı statistik faktlar yer alıb. Bəlkə də bu iddialar heç də qeyri-real deyil. Nəinki qeyri-real, cəsarətli olsaq, bəlkə də zəruridir deyə bilərik, çünki daha az saatlı iş həftəsi daha az iş xətası, ətraf-mühitə vurulan zərər, daha az stress, qəza və iqtisadi qeyri-bərabərlikdir. Breqman vurğulayır ki, dəyişiklik ideyalarla başlayır. Nə vaxtsa bizim bu günümüz keçmişdə yaşayan insanların utopiyası idi. Ona görə də ifrat istehsal və istehlak kimi problemlərin öhdəsindən gəlmək üçün gərək ilk növbədə qurduğumuz sistemlərə olan yanaşmamızı dəyişək. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabı bizə cari iqtisadiyyatların qeyri-reallığını, ideal və ya utopik hesab edilən iqtisadi sistemlərin isə reallığını çox möhtəşəm və axıcı dil ilə izah edir. Məncə, kitabı oxuduqdan sonra heç kim bir daha düşündüyü ənənəvi fikirlərini və ya doqmaları yada salmayacaq. Kitabı axtarıb-tapıb oxumağıma əsas səbəb Rutqer Breqmanın öz kitabı haqqında The Economist-ə verdiyi müsahibəni dinləməyim olmuşdu (müsahibəni dinləmək üçün keçid: http://bit.ly/Ukutopia_Bregman). Bir iqtisadçı kimi mənə maraqlı gəlmişdi ki, görəsən yuxarı abzasda qeyd edilən məqamlar haqqında özünə belə inamla və güvənlə danışan şəxs nə dərəcədə ciddidir və nə dərəcədə real və yaxşı bilgilərin toplandığı kitab yaza bilib. Doqmalarımızı qıran ideyalar həmişə cəlbedici olur. Qısa müddət ərzində kitabı elektron olaraq tapdım və 1 ay ərzində yavaş-yavaş oxudum. Sonunda isə əsl düşüncə yenilənməsi yaşadım. ""Realistlər üçün utopiya"" kitabını sadəcə bəyənmək deyil, həm də onun faktuallığını nəzərə alıb qiymətləndirmək lazımdır. Son dövrlərin aktual məsələlərinə toxunan, müəyyən həll yolları göstərən və ən əsası fərziyələrlə deyil, real analitik yöntəmlərlə izahat aparan kitabı oxumağıma çox şad oldum. Sitat: ""Bəşəriyyətin möhtəşəm ölçü daşları olan utopiyalarla əlaqədar hər zaman şübhələr olub. Tanınmış sosioloq Albert Hirşmana görə, utopiyalar 3 səviyyədə hücuma məruz qalıblar: axırsızlıq (bu mümkün deyil), təhlükə (risklər çox böyükdür) və qüsurluluq (bu distopiyaya səbəb olacaq degenerasiyadır), amma Hirşman həm də yazır ki, necə ki utopiyalar gerçəkləşir, adi bir şey kimi qəbul olunmağa başlanılır"" (Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) Kitab çox güclü kontrastlar üzərində qurulub. Bu o deməkdir ki, mövzular keçmiş dövrün gələcəyə olan yanaşmalarından hərəkətə gələrək, bu günümüzü də öz növbəsində hansısa gələcək zamanın keçmişi kimi qəbul edib, müxtəlif iqtisadi göstəriciləri ortaq məxrəcə gətirməyə çalışır. Məsələn, kitab ilk səhifələrində aydınlaşdırır ki, hələ Keynes 20-ci əsrin ilk rübündə daha az saata malik iş həftəsini iqtisadi cəhətdən məntiqli və düzgün hesab edirdi. Bundan əlavə, kasıb ölkələrin cəmiyyətlərin niyə görə kasıb olduqları ilə əlaqədar bir çox maraqlı təcrübə və məlumatlara əsasən səbəblər üzərində dayanılır. Qeyd edilir ki, kasıb ölkələr ona görə kasıbdır ki, onlarda sadəcə oalraq yetərincə nağd pul ehtiyatları yoxdur. Halbuki, həm media, həm də populist siyasətçilər kasıb cəmiyyətləri demokratiyanın olmamasında, insanların savadsızlığında və ya digər hansısa ictimai göstəricilərdə olduğunu deyirlər. Təbii ki, onların müəyyən əhəmiyyəti var, amma aparılan real təcrübələr və sahə araşdırmaları sübut edib ki, isanlara ilkin investisiyanı təmin edəndə, özləri həmin investisiyanı artırmağın yollarını axtarıb-tapırlar. Sitat: ""19-cu əsrdə bərabərsizlik sosial sinif məsələsi ilə əlaqədar idi. Bu günlərdə isə bu məkan ilə əlaqədardır. ""Bütün ölkələrin proletarları birləşin!"" uzun müddət müxtəlif yerlərin kasıb insanlarının əzabkeşliyini birləşdirən ideya olub. Bu gün isə, Dünya Bankının aparıcı iqtisadçısı Branko Milanoviç qeyd edir ki, ""Proletariat həmrəyliyi artıq ölüb, çünki artıq qlobal proletariat deyə bir şey qalmayıb.""""(Breqman, Realistlər üçün utopiya, 2016) İnsan özü özlüyündə çox qəribə canlıdır, çünki o xəyal edə bilir.

Onlardan bəziləri isə artıq reallaşıb, bəziləri reallşmaq üzərədir, digərlərinin reallaşması üçün isə az qalıb. Utopiya anlayışının özü əslində inkişaflar üçün mühüm zəmindir. İnsan təxəyyülündə özünə varlıq qazanan istənilən ideya, hətta utopiyalar belə nə vaxtsa gerçəkləşəcəklər, sadəcə o istiqamətdə kiçik addımlar irəliləmək yetərlidir. Sitat: ""Abstrakt ideallardan fərqli olaraq, çertyojlar nifaqa tolerantlıq göstərməyən dəyişməz qayda-qanunlardan ibarət olurlar. İtalyan şair Tomasso Kampanellanın ""Günəşin şəhəri (1602)"" çox yaxşı nümunə təklif edir. Bu utopiyada və ya distopiyada, fərdi mülkiyyət ciddi olaraq qadağan olunub, hamı bir-birini sevməyə məcbur edilib və dava-dalaş ölümlə cəzalandırılır.

Both of these books explain the idea very well, but they have different strengths just the same. I think Yang managed to show more clearly the urgency for this system at this point in time as we are entering into the forth industrial revolution, while Bergman explains the history, and the science behind this idea better.It is a radical idea, and I’m not sure if I would have taken it seriously a few years ago. In fact, I don’t think I would have given it much of a thought until I started to read up on the pending industrial revolution. That is what made it realistic for me. There just doesn’t seem to be a viable path into that new reality with out some version of universal basic income. But what surprised me about the history Bergman presents is that it is actually a much older idea, and it had some really surprising campaigner for it. The fact that Richard Nixon is the American president that has got closest to getting that kind of system into action was one of those surprises. From listening to his party these days one would hardly expect that, but he did it because it seemed, even then, to make good financial sense. This idea isn’t just a shot in the dark, there is a lot of research behind it. So when people say it will not work because people are so lazy they will never do anything if they get free money, they need to show evidence for that opinion. What this book shows is evidence from other research that point in the other direction. All in all, I think this is an interesting book, and the case for universal basic income is very well argued here."

We go to a doctor when we're sick, a therapist when we're sad, a dietitian when we're overweight, prison when we're convicted and a job coach when we're out of work. All these services cost vast sums of money, but with little to show for it. In the US, where the cost of healthcare is highest on the planet, the life expectancy for many is actually going down. All the while the market and commercial interests enjoy a free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar and fat, putting us on a fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever-more jobs sending us back again to the job coach and the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don't have on junk we don't need in order to impress people we can't stand.Then we can go and cry on our therapist's shoulder.That's the dystopia we're living in today."

Bregman certainly has thought-provoking ideas to share and makes you question, or at least wonder about how the world could be a different, better place. The book reads well, keeps you interested, and avoids being polarizing by building his arguments on ethical virtues. Instead he uses logical arguments and often refers research in favor of his viewpoints. The book obviously doesn't really tell you how to go about implementing his ideas; what could go wrong and neither talks about the not-so positive sides; maybe not for realists after all!"

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51471625-rac,0,This was a very intriguing book. I started reading this book after watching Rutger Bregman’s interview with Trevor Noah. It was highly informative and made the best bets for a utopian reality. He also makes the arguments for the need to strive towards realizing utopian ideas however far fetched they may seem. The historical anecdotes presented and the plausible optimistic extrapolations towards a better future makes for an exciting read.

Mainly concerning universal basic income, shorter workweek, opening borders, eradication of poverty etc. And also backing up these ideas with facts and research.""If we want to change the world, we need to be unrealistic, unreasonable and impossible.

63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566577-sunil,3,"My first read of the year. The book explores a few interesting concepts about making the world better but the arguments have a sense of not being open to criticism. As it often tends to be in such books, most of the anecdotes and examples are drawn from a very few highly educated, heavily industrial, postmodern free market societies (read Scandinavia ). These ideas are presumed to be valid across the rest of the world, criminally overlooking at least half a dozen of other unique factors at play for each culture and society. A minimum requirement of a sustainable idea is it ought to be applicable across the globe, say, can you really convince a society in Bangladesh or a labour force in Vietnam to accept 4 day work week? Even after Universal Basic Income? The book I believe is full of such ideal drivel and cherry-picked arguments, that end up turning wooly at convenience and to challenge. I quite liked the fact that it does open up a conversation to look at alternatives to the current socio-economic systems we have, but falls flat to make a case for any one choice of an alternative over another. Bit of meandering without any conviction in the argument. Quite basic stuff, but perhaps good enough to get some groupthinking leftists excited."

It's not overly complex and sticks to its core recommendations (namely universal basic income and shorter work week), which works in its favour. However, I did feel some parts weren't as effective. The whole chapter on GDP could have been boiled down into a page long summary saying essentially that this economic measure is flawed. Also, the writing style was mostly enjoyable but some statements felt kinda hollow e.g. 'the targets of our performance-driven society are no less absurd than the five-year plans of the former U.S.S.R.'

If there was a 4.5, I would totally go for it.I don't agree with all the ideas presented here but I enjoyed thinking about them and seeing some different perspectives on it.There's one sentence in this book that I'm saying to some friends for a while: ""If you don't like the way the world is going, realize that there are many people out there thinking just like you. Turn down the TV, look around, and organize"". The current state of many people is to read the news and TV and complain on social media. For some unknown reason, this is how they think they are going to do some change. 🤷‍♂I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to rethink how the world is going and what it may be. It doesn't matter if it's going to happen or not, but you will have a taste on different arguments about that.Here are my raw notes about this book:6 billion of the world's 7 billion population has a cellphone. Just 4.5 billion have a toilet -- WATThe advertisement makes us spend the money we don't have, on junk we don't need, to impress people we can't standWith the high cost of health care, the life expectancy for many is going downThe market provides us with food full of sugar and fat that our health tends to go downThe current generation grew listening to: ""You can do whatever you want, you're special.""Money empowers people and gives them choicesThe only reason why people are poor is that they don't have enough money. Studies show that when you give money, no strings attached, they mostly prosperWhen poor people receive money, no strings attached, they tend to work harderThe basic income experiment in Canada was shut down after four years, and the data for the experiment was not analyzed. The data was somehow realized many years ago, and the results show it may have been a successNot long ago, democracy seemed to be a utopiaA policy for the poor (only) is a poor policyIt seems people are more open to solidarity if it benefits them personally -- it remembers me of how the USA let you deduct donations from your taxesIf a basic income is proposed for everyone instead of just the poor, it would probably be more acceptedOf course, some people will want to work less, but there's overwhelming Evidence suggesting the majority of people want to work, whether they need to or not. Not having a job makes us deeply unhappyArtists may stop doing paid work altogetherBasic income will allow the poor to look for jobs where they can learn and grow since the basic will be covered -- what is going to happen to mechanical jobs that (not only the poor) people do? Automation, maybe?Psychology of scarcity. Why the poor make so many bad choices?Investments in education will only help a lot of children when they leave the poverty linePoverty annihilates the future. All that matters is here and nowIt doesn't matter if there are ten candidates for every job; the problem is always considered to be with the supply, not the demand. The candidate needs to be betterSocial services expect people to show their shortcomings instead of their strengths, or they may have their benefits cut. It helps to keep people trapped in povertyThe GDP is blind to many things. One good example is technology advancementGDP also benefits from wars, drug abuse, gambling, environmental pollutionAs the writer, Kevin kelly says: Productivity is for robots. Humans excel at wasting time experimenting and creatingFound our political system based on productivity figures is to turn the good life into a spreadsheetBoredom may be one of the biggest problems of the future when we start to have less and less work to do -- I'm not sure about that. I expect to have much more creative things popping out as workOur ancestors were not richer but certainly had more leisureWhat once was categorized as leisure is work today (art, sport, care, etc.).We are not against the workweek; the idea is that the poor (and others) will be able to do more meaningful workWhen people with a reasonable salary are offered if they want to double the salary or have more time off, they opt for the time offWork is the refuge of people that have nothing better to do -- I'm not sure if I agree with that. Work is awesome; you just have to find the work you loveThe richer we get, the expendable we become since we don't contribute with tangible things to societyBanks need people much more than people need banksStudies show that countries with more managers are less productive -- what a surprise! LOLHalf of the managers interviewed in a research say their work is meaningless and many of them don't feel connected with the company missionHigher taxes will get more people to do useful work. Just tax people who have a lot of money and are not contributing with tangible things to the society (example: transaction fee for high-frequency trading). It would not give us all a big share of the pie; it would also make the whole pie to grow bigger as those people would go out to become teachers and engineersHigher taxes will reallocate people to professions that bring something useful for the society (to do useful work) -- how useful is HFT? I just realized it's useless :(Instead of thinking about what we need to make a living in a bullshit job in the future, we should think about what skill we WANT to have to make a livingIf we start to shape our education to what we want the market will adapt -- I do not buy that. There a (big IMO) chance that we will have a lot of people that will not be able to do something useful and places needing people to do useful work but not having qualified peopleIn the future, we will have two individuals per company: a man and a dog. The man to feed the dog and the dog to not let the man touch the equipment. -- LOLProgressive tax based on income would make more equity. We have to save capitalism from capitalistsThe future is already here; it's just not evenly distributedBorders are discriminatory.In the past, when the border with Mexico and the USA were not so closed, around 80% of Mexicans came back home after tome time. Now that the US spends a lot of money to guard the borders, not so many Mexicans that enter the country come back, as it's hard to go through the borderWe tend to seek information that confirms what we currently believePeople are most likely to change their ideas if y;u confront them with disagreeable points as direct as possibleWe usually don't vote for ourselves only, but for the group, we want to belong to -- of course, we are not considering the fact where politicians pay people to vote for them...What is the value of free speech when you don't have anything valuable to say anymore?Basic income, world without borders, 15 hours workweek. How much longer?Ideas however outrageous have changed the world and it will againOne strategy to make things lets radical reasonable is to say things that are so radical that look insane (Donald Trump does that all the time)As we speak, at least 1/3 of the workforce are stuck in bullshit jobs they find meaninglessSe people said after a talk that a high lucrative bullshit job gave them the financial freedom to pursue a meaningful activity -- that's very controversial. Would it worth it to work on a bullshit task just to have the money so you can work on something else?It's time for a new labor movement. One that not only fights for new jobs but for jobs that fulfill us. Work that has intrinsic value.If you don't like the way the world is going, realize that there are many people out there thinking just like you. Turn down the TV, look around, and organize"
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142965-rob-smith,1,"What a dumpster fire.Utopia for Realist is Rutger Bregman's book on the Utopian policies such as a universal basic income (UBI), open borders and a shorter work weak. The first half of the book is strong, and I learned some things I didn't know before such as Speenhamland and Nixon's own legislative attempts at a UBI. The text is a breezy read, and it's written to be as accessible as possible to his ideas.Unfortunately while it starts out strong, the book goes off the rails, into a ditch and sets itself on fire by the end of the book. There's more bad in this book than good. There's a lot of fluff writing that isn't needed, and he really glosses over historical or policy points that absolutely require some nuance. I can forgive this with the anecdotes to present his points, but when he gets to recalculating the GDP as part of utopian thinking he begins to lose me. And when he talks about open borders eradicating poverty he loses me even more. Bregman also contradicts himself in several places, in some very important ways. He claims technological progress has stopped, but then boasts how far cellular technology and the internet has come since the '90s. He champions Friedman and Hayek, as well as the neoliberal establishment, but bemoans the financial crisis and the way most jobs have become precarious, or useless. I'm not sure how he can support those ideas, when using them are how we got to where we are now. For example. he wants to toss the welfare system because it merely prolongs unemployment, but the way the welfare system is now is entirely because of Reagan and Clinton cutting them deeply during their presidencies. And isn't the UBI merely a return to the social safety net of the past, but merely with an expanded scope?Bregman out of nowhere slams the left towards the end of the book. Socialists to him wallow in their moral superiority, appeal to emotions more than reason, and are boring. They care about the national debt, don't want to fight poverty and claim taxes are too high. For starters, this sounds more like the American Democratic Party, than it does any socialist I know. Two, I wonder if Bregman has even read what a socialist like Bernie Sanders or Jeremy Corbyn stand for, because they sure as hell don't sound like that. And lastly, I don't know how he can slam socialists and the left while at the same time stealing their ideas wholesale and then claiming credit for them. It's a bizarre work of intellectual dishonesty."
70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14122535-vivek-aithal,4,"'Utopia for Realists' outlines the most compelling case I've seen for UBI (illustrating how close we've come to UBI throughout history definitely helps). It warns us to be good at spotting the 'war against poverty' and the 'war against poor people'. It drives home the argument that poverty is just a lack of money, and doesn't necessarily imply a lack of intellect or financial literacy or ""good nature"". Furthermore, poverty leads people to take inferior decisions and tends to lead to a downward spiral (Sugarcane farmers in India had a difference of ~15 IQ points when they were rich vs poor in a year). UFR stresses on factors that led us here - leverage of capital and the change in labour-capital revenue ratio. Finally, Rutger Bregman encourages us to envision the next utopia (especially in the wake of AI, and automation on steroids) to combat rising income inequality. Memorable Quotes : - “Poverty is fundamentally about a lack of cash. It’s not about stupidity,” stresses the economist Joseph Hanlon.- “Nothing is stronger than an idea whose time has come.” - Unlike many of his contemporaries, he understood that poverty is not a lack of character. It’s a lack of cash.- At the end of the workday in almost every office you can find exhausted staff sitting at their desks aimlessly browsing the Facebook profiles of people they don’t know, waiting until the first of their coworkers has left for the day. - For 200 years that system was the labor market, which ceaselessly churned out new jobs and, in so doing, distributed the fruits of progress. - The richer we as a society become, the less effectively the labor market will be at distributing prosperity. - Technological progress may make a society more prosperous in aggregate, but there’s no economic law that says everyone will benefit. - The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones."
71,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61434319-kristin,5,"Wow, I can feel my entire brain lighting up after reading this book. Ever feel like the political situation just offers misery everywhere? Wish there were a little hope on the horizon? Sick of people telling you things are just the way they are and because of the depravity of human nature it will never get better? This book is for you (and apparently me although I had no clue).This book offers an insight into a lot of the research on some of the hot button phrases you hear circling around (basic universal income, open borders, shorter workweeks, tackling homelessness, etc.). Bregman goes into the historical basis of these ideas, places where they have been put into effect, research, and the evolution of thought over time. He shows a world where everything we take for granted now was once considered a Utopia and completely unrealistic, and then he turns the concept on its head.According to Bregman, one of the greatest problems we face today is the lack of hope and ideas, a basic understanding that things can be better than they are, a lack of imagination. Particularly on the nose was the criticism of what he calls the ""underdog socialist,"" the left that defines itself by the things that it is against (ie racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.) rather than what it is for. He says the reason the left keeps floundering is not that they are wrong (obviously these things are awful and have no place in a Utopia) but rather that their message is dull and uninspiring. It lacks hope and a plan. I'll be chewing on this for a while. In a time when I've felt beaten down by the system and the constant battles raging through the US (the current administration couldn't be doing a better job of going directly against research for what would help people if they actually were able to read it) this book got me excited again about the kind of society we can shape."
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8331026-antti-v-rt,2,"Bregman starts by summarising Hans Rosling's Factfulness: world is in almost every respect much better off today than in the past. Everything is better than ever before - but that does not mean everything is perfect, far from it. We still have the poor with us, even in the richest countries. On top of that is the mental health crisis. There is still work to do. Bregman has a simple plan: just give everyone free money.This plan, called Universal Basic Income, is not Bregman's brainchild. It has been proposed many times, even by right-wingers such as Nixon and Milton Friedman. But if it is an old idea, why hasn't it been put to practice?Basically because no-one trusts people, especially poor people, to do the right decisions if they got money without obligations. Some fear people would just stop working altogether. Some fear that people would use the money on alcohol and tobacco. Some fear that the moral fabric of the society would fray if people were not obligated to work. Bregman doesn't believe in any of these harms. He quotes studies, randomised trials and case studies to show how people use the free money to good ends. Since I support UBI, I expected to enjoy this book, but somehow didn't. I'm not quite sure why, but reading this book felt like a chore. There was a feeling like this was a great article that had been stretched to fill a book."

There are at least a couple of studies he cites where he argues the scientists mistakenly drew completely wrong conclusions from the data and ended up thwarting the entire human civilisation. (Psst, that's how historians roll.) Shaun Pollock misreading the DLS doesn't seem so out of the ordinary now. Some of the ideas: Productivity is for robots, growth in western countries isn't making lives any better, tax the bleep out of sectors with negative externalities like finance to keep the smart kids from joining, UBI is cheaper and more empowering than social services, those who predicted flying cars also predicted plenty of time for leisure- but we've all but forgotten about the latter.

There was a time in the last century when we said that the technological revolution would reduce a lot of need for manpower and change what ""work"" meant.

I was largely unmoved, and half the time I simply don’t see what they’re talking about. Maybe it’s me.Rutger Bregman’s tone is pleasant and easy – but perhaps a bit too easy: sometimes I found the homeliness a bit of a handicap. If you want to be convincing on a serious subject, it pays to be serious. He has interesting things to say – maybe a universal basic income would work to improve all our lives, maybe development aid really is a waste of time. But ultimately, I found his line of argument to be consistently mushy: it’s one thing to advance interesting ideas, it’s apparently quite another to argue them cogently until you’ve convinced people. He certainly didn’t convince me."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18808584-jonny-thomson,3,"There is a lot to take away from this book, and I valued a lot the general introduction, tone and conclusion of this book: that we need idealists, Utopians, and dreamers otherwise change will never happen. It's rather Hegelian in that way. As to the content of the book, the arguments are laid out really nicely; they combine a hefty array of statistics, alongside an easy to follow narrative. As a bit of a philosophy nerd, I especially loved the frequent and artful use of scholars, thinkers, and intellectuals to bookend certain arguments (John Stuart Mill gets a lot of reference and Bregman has inspired to get a biography of his!). The book is essentially made up of four and a half arguments (I'm sure there are more, but this is what I will take away...): 1) Introduce a Universal Basic Income to alleviate poor,1.5) The same ""cash direct"" philosophy is best for international aid too,2) Reduce the working week (15 hours ideally)3) Ditch ""bullsh*t jobs""4) Have completely open borders. I'll look at each (I liked 2 of these!)Universal Basic Income There is a lot of like here - many of the studies cited do seem to show promising outcomes when we give a substantial 'no strings attached' wad of cash to poor people. He makes the point that poor people often know what's in their own interests, and study after study shows there is no (as Victorians believed) inherent character defect to the poor - the poor are poor from lack of money, not of virtue. So, giving the poorest lump sums not only has better outcomes (employment, health, dignity etc....) but also can cost less overall than decades+ of state welfare. BUTThe studies listed are all incredibly small, short and ultimately brought to an end. Why were they stopped? Because they were deemed too expensive. Bregman rather hides this by blaming conservative governments, and putting it down to being political, but in each case the studies were stopped because it was deemed the money could be better spent elsewhere...I do not deny there is much to be said for a small, poor-focused, basic income, but the idea of Universal Basic Income goes WAY beyond the evidence and examples cited here. 15 Hour WeekThis was the most enlightening and perspective shifting section. The evidence is cited that often people working less really doesn't drastically drop productivity, but rather can improve mental health and also re-balance the care deficit of the genders (an interesting statistic cited is that even if men and women do equal jobs with equal pay, the women  still  do more care of family and domestic chores). It was fascinating too to learn how the current 5 day, 40 hour week came about thanks to Ford and Kellogg really running experiments on their work forces - not, it should be noted, for philanthropic reasons, but rather to maximise efficiency. That said, it is yet to be clear if the shorter working week might have implications we cannot see (such as maybe the positive effects are only initial and will plateau). However, a LOT of evidence seems to point to reducing the working week and overturning the fetishisation of working until you drop. Ditch Bullsh*t jobs By far the worst section. Yes, it is true that we as a society need rubbish collectors more than other jobs on a day to day basis, but does that mean we ought to either pay them the same salaries as bankers? This section seemed to me to be a cliched tirade and rant of a leftist academic who just wanted to basically throw all the bankers onto a slag heap. I personally don't value or particularly see the merit of 'lobbyist, tax men and investment bankers' but I also accept that my values are not the values of society at large. His decision to lampoon certain jobs over others seemed to me to be the arbitrary pettiness of a nostalgic and quixotic leftist - no real evidence or argument other than his feeling. Just because I agree with him doesn't make this less true. Completely open bordersWhere the previous suggestion I thought a rant, this one I felt was just a bit naive but also inconsistent. Bregman makes the fair point that opening borders would alleviate poverty more than any other action. He also cites how people tend to go back to their native country when left free to do so (although the 'evidence' for this is shaky - he compares the 80% return rate of Mexicans from the USA in the 60s to the 7% today but I can't help but feel as if the world is VERY different 60 years later!).What I think Bregman either ignores or under-appreciates is that many people across the world feel strongly about their own country, and their own historical values. I think to assume that there are no differences in fundamental human values is to underplay e.g. the role of the woman in Middle East Islamic traditions vs. Western European. Oddly, Bregman in his first chapters makes a strong and compelling case to remove GDP as it ignores all those things that we value the most. But then aren't patriotism, cultural history and sense of identity important to a lot, if not most, people? I'm not saying immigration can destroy this, but large scale open border migration would most certainly do so. I find it inconsistent for Bregman to lionise values over economics, and then makes this chapter almost exclusively about economic benefit - or are patriotism and national identity not values he (subjectively) doesn't think ought to be merited as such? So, overall, I enjoyed this book in the hopeful idealism that it offers. I agree we need to think big, and to seek to change the world drastically (even if the actual change is a slow thing as opposed to revolution!). However I do disagree with many of his points, but that doesn't mean we can't take something, a lot, from this book, and I would recommend people do read it."

I also doubt the motivation of the Silicon Valley UBI supporters. But while reading this book I had my convictions challenged. Radical, progressive ideas take time to implement and actually, the results from the experiments are intriguing. The author makes a great case for taking the UBI seriously. While I am not in agreement with all points made in the book, I believe it is a good start to learn more. But I don’t think it should be the only book you read on the subject. "

Utopia for Realists excited me in the same way that Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now did almost exactly one year ago. These books aren’t similar in style or methodology, nor do I think Bregman and Pinker would necessarily agree on the state of the world and the best ways to make it better. But both texts are infused with an energetic optimism––a zeal for being real about where we are and where we still need to go––that motivates and empowers me to keep striving for my own utopian dreams.I discovered Rutger Bregman by way of this excellent interview from Intelligence Squared. I was immediately drawn to his unabashed advocacy for ideas such as universal basic income, a shorter workweek, and a radical rethinking of how we structure human labor. These are transformative positions that I’ve been engaging with for some years, but only recently have I noticed them gaining mainstream notoriety. Bregman, it turns out, is one of the main reasons for this––a service for which this little book blogger is extremely grateful.Utopia for Realists is an electrifying work of futurism. In terms of readability, it is the single best book I’ve come across for introducing people to this niche of thinking––the best-ideas-you’ve-never-heard-of-or-just-thought-were-crazy approach. In ten highly-entertaining and endnote-peppered chapters, Bregman lays out his case for why the modern status quo is hobbling human potential and what we should do to change that. Each section presents its own particular argument, but the overall message can be summed up as a clarion call to institute planet-wide redistribution mechanisms to create fairer, safer, and more prosperous societies. Bold and sweeping action, Bregman suggests, is the surest way to propel 21st-century civilization to new experiential and ethical heights.To begin, Bregman characterizes contemporary humanity as suffering from a small-minded failure of collective imagination––one that persists despite the fact that we spent the last few centuries creating a “Land of Plenty” of which previous generations could only dream:""The Land of Plenty is shrouded in fog. Precisely when we should be shouldering the historic task of investing this rich, safe, and healthy existence with meaning, we’ve buried utopia instead. There’s no new dream to replace it because we can’t imagine a better world than the one we’ve got."" (10-1)""Optimism and pessimism have become synonymous with consumer confidence or the lack thereof. Radical ideas about a different world have become almost literally unthinkable. The expectations of what we as a society can achieve have been dramatically eroded, leaving us with the cold, hard truth that without utopia, all that remains is technocracy. Politics has been watered down to problem management. Voters swing back and forth not because the parties are so different, but because it’s barely possible to tell them apart, and what now separates right from left is a percentage point or two on the income tax rate."" (15)As a response to this predicament, Bregman urges readers to commit themselves to expansive and ambitious ideals:""True progress begins with something no knowledge economy can produce: wisdom about what it means to live well. We have to do what great thinkers like John Stuart Mill, Bertrand Russell, and John Maynard Keynes were already advocating for 100 years ago: to “value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful.” We have to direct our minds to the future. To stop consuming our own discontent through polls and relentlessly bad-news media. To consider alternatives and form new collectives. To transcend this confining zeitgeist and recognize our shared idealism."" (19-20)In the wake of Donald Trump’s election in 2016, I became temporarily allergic to this kind of “think big” radicalism. Better, I thought, to double down on the status quo in hopes of softening the impact of the runaway Trump train. And while I still bristle at flippant talk of “revolution” or “changing everything,” the last couple years have brought me back to some ideas that fueled my late teens and early twenties––lofty notions about true value, meaningful labor, and a desire to revise my methods for flourishing in the 21st century. Bregman got to me at the right time.So, what are these “utopian ideas” that will supposedly save us? The first and most important of Bregman’s propositions couldn’t be simpler: Just give people money. This idea, which is usually floated using the label of Universal Basic Income (UBI), involves direct cash transfers from national governments to their citizens. No cumbersome qualification process or bureaucracy invading your life to make sure you’re spending the “right way”––just a regular flow of funds to your bank account to use as you see fit. “The great thing about money,” Bregman quips, “is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need” (32).Bregman dives into the research on cash transfer programs, revealing that they are far more successful than other safety net programs when it comes to alleviating poverty. Confronting the constant worry and hardship that poverty inflicts, poor folks can become consumed by a ""scarcity mentality,"" causing them to make inefficacious but understandable decisions that most people would make under similar conditions (57). Bregman eviscerates the harmful myth that poor people are simply lazy and undeserving of aid because of some intrinsic flaw, and also demonstrates that cash transfers boost career investment in disadvantaged populations: “When the poor receive no-strings cash they actually tend to work harder” (32). This advocacy for Earth’s most vulnerable denizens is damned inspiring and completely necessary in a globalized age when “our societies have never been more dependent on one another” (183).Bregman also does heroic work by calling out Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a ludicrous method for measuring economic success. GDP––an obscure economic metric that was rejected by its inventor as an appropriate gauge for national prosperity––obfuscates the fact that modern capitalist powerhouses not only ignore the struggles of citizens and environmental degradation, but often profit from them. Bregman explains:""Besides being blind to lots of good things, the GDP also benefits from all manner of human suffering. Gridlock, drug abuse, adultery? Goldmines for gas stations, rehab centers, and divorce attorneys. If you were the GDP, your ideal citizen would be a compulsive gambler with cancer who’s going through a drawn-out divorce that he copes with by popping fistfuls of Prozac and going berserk on Black Friday. Environmental pollution even does double duty: One company makes a mint by cutting corners while another is paid to clean up the mess. By contrast, a centuries-old tree doesn’t count until you chop it down and sell it as lumber. Mental illness, obesity, pollution, crime––in terms of GDP, the more the better."" (105-6)There is no perfect or comprehensive way of measuring economic gains and losses, and we should admit this while also seeking better metrics than the lousy ones that have dominated in recent decades. Bregman also reminds us that “Some things in life, like music, resist all attempts at greater efficiency. While we can produce coffee machines faster and more cheaply, a violinist can’t pick up the pace without spoiling the tune” (119).Equally important is Bregman’s analysis of our failure to intelligently spend our most precious resource: time. He decries the culture of overwork that pervades wealthy societies, showing how miserable it makes us and lamenting our unwillingness to leverage our fabulous technology and capital to free everyone up to enjoy more leisure. Recounting some key anecdotes from labor’s history of chipping away at the workweek over the last century, Bregman wants us to keep this momentum going:""There are strong indications that in a modern knowledge economy, even forty hours a week is too much. Research suggests that someone who is constantly drawing on their creative abilities can, on average, be productive for no more than six hours a day. It’s no coincidence that the world’s wealthy countries, those with a large creative class and highly educated populations, have also shaved the most time off their workweeks."" (141)While we should collectively strive for a culture in which everyone works less, we should also get real about the actual value that certain vocations bring to the table. Bregman offers a useful framing by drawing a distinction between workers who create wealth (e.g. farmers, scientists, teachers, builders, garbage collectors) and ones who merely shift it around (e.g. bankers, lawyers, accountants, bureaucrats):""Bizarrely, it’s precisely the jobs that shift money around––creating next to nothing of tangible value––that net the best salaries. It’s a fascinating, paradoxical state of affairs. How is it possible that all those agents of prosperity––the teachers, the police officers, the nurses––are paid so poorly, while the unimportant, superfluous, and even destructive shifters do so well?"" (156, emphasis his)It’s not that we should abolish the jobs of “shifters,” but rather that they should take a pay cut in accordance with their modest value. On the flip side, people who create wealth––who do the hard work of bolstering society’s intellectual, social, and physical infrastructures––need a raise that rewards them according to their immense value. This would provide a much-needed update to the job market’s choice architecture, nudging our best minds toward labor that actually matters.The last main element of Bregman’s agenda––open borders––is perhaps his most radical, and also the one with which I am the least familiar. I’ve never read anyone who made a strong case for open borders, but Bregman’s is both surprising and convincing. National borders, in his view, are artifacts of modernity that constitute “the single biggest cause of discrimination in all of world history” on a globalized planet that is “wide open for everything but people” (216-7). Instead of spending billions on imperfect border security that endangers citizens and foreigners alike, Bregman would have us open the gates to the Land of Plenty. This would constitute a much more compassionate and prosperous approach to global politics, and could be implemented with reasonable accountability measures for immigrants:""Overall, the net value of immigrants is almost wholly positive. In countries like Hungary, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom, they even bring in more tax revenue per household than the native population. Still not reassured? Countries could also decide not to give immigrants the right to government assistance, or not until after a minimum number of years, or not until they’ve paid, say, $50,000 in taxes. And you could set up similar parameters if you’re concerned they form a political threat or won’t integrate. You can create language and culture tests. You can withhold the right to vote. And you can send them back if they don’t find a job. Unfair? Perhaps so. Yet isn’t the alternative of keeping people out altogether exponentially more unfair?"" (226-7)I find this line of reasoning difficult to disagree with, at least in the absence of the extreme circumstances discussed below.As I’m sure you can tell if you’ve made it this far, I really liked this book and think Bregman is a smart guy with his heart in the right place. However, Utopia for Realists has a few significant blindspots that merit mentioning. First, although the book is stocked with encouraging and actionable policies, Bregman doesn’t offer much guidance regarding coalition-building or political strategy. Implementing just one of his recommendations (let alone all of them) will require seismic changes in political power structures across the globe, and while I think he has a great understanding of the desired destination, his slogan for how to get there boils down to “Ideas can change the world!”––almost verbatim the title of his last chapter. Bregman’s not wrong, but he’s only half right; I don’t think ideas alone can change the world, and that crucial piece of the puzzle is missing here. Fortunately for Americans, there is at least one  candidate with UBI at the center of his platform running for President in 2020, so we needn’t depend solely on the power of our ideas to move in this direction.The second problem with Utopia for Realists is that it all but ignores the looming, omnipresent problem of climate change. Bregman gestures vaguely toward some ways his proposed policies might ameliorate climate change, but never devotes any serious time to the subject. Worse still, he doesn’t even consider the possible ways his ideas could either contribute negatively to climate change or go awry because of the climate crisis. The two most obvious examples involve consumption and mass migration. In the absence of radical and widespread changes in our methods for manufacturing, packaging, transporting, selling, and consuming products, increasing the purchasing power of the world’s population through cash transfer programs could supercharge our already-supercharged carbon footprint. Also, I think Bregman’s argument for open borders becomes decidedly less persuasive when whole swaths of the planet become uninhabitable and some 8 or 9 billion people start scrambling for cooler climes.Finally, although Bregman is appropriately critical of his fellow liberals at times, he also dabbles in the anti-rational rhetoric that is all too common on the left these days. For example:""If it is true that ideas don’t change things gradually but in fits and starts––in shocks––then the basic premise of our democracy, our journalism, and our education is all wrong. It would mean, in essence, that the Enlightenment model of how people change their opinions––through information-gathering and reasoned deliberation––is really a buttress for the status quo. It would mean that those who swear by rationality, nuance, and compromise fail to grasp how ideas govern the world."" (240)Here, Bregman blends fact and falsehood into an unsavory stew. It’s true that the “rational actor” model of human behavior is spurious, and it’s also true that moments of shock can have an outsized influence on world events. However, these truths coexist with another truth: People also gather information, deliberate a lot, and change their minds––sometimes in defense of the status quo, and sometimes not. Rationality, nuance, and compromise are not the only games in town, but they still serve as agents of incremental change, most importantly as preparatory exercises for choosing one course of action over another when the shit hits the fan.Bregman also sinks into anti-rational whimsy in his closing remarks:""Don’t let anyone tell you what’s what. If we want to change the world, we need to be unrealistic, unreasonable, and impossible. Remember: those who called for the abolition of slavery, for suffrage for women, and for same-sex marriage were also once branded lunatics. Until history proved them right."" (263-4)This is an unbecoming sendoff for a book titled Utopia for Realists, and again we are subjected to an unsettling mixture of sense and nonsense. Bregman is of course correct that the humanist heroes of history have been granted the moral high ground in retrospect, and in fact had it all along. However, those noble folks had the high ground precisely because their views were more reasonable than the prevailing views of their time. Their work––arduous, unforgiving, sometimes deadly––was not the work of unrealistic, unreasonable, or impossible people. It was the work of people who understood the true meaning of rationality better than most others around them.This objection may seem merely semantic, but I actually think it’s worth harping on for a moment longer. Directives such as “Don’t let anyone tell you what’s what” and “We need to be unrealistic,” despite being forceful and romantic, actually undermine Bregman’s position. Bregman is not a crazy person; he’s an informed, educated man trying to get us to see that ideas often dismissed as crazy are actually worth considering. But encouraging people to shrug or scoff when the world tells them they’re being unreasonable is not the way to recruit the people who can actually summon utopian ideals into reality. It’s a recipe for disaster on both sides of the political spectrum, and everywhere in between. It leaves the door open for charlatans and idiots to walk right in and insist that their unreasonable ideas deserve equal consideration with all the others. Why not solve global poverty through the power of manifesting, eh, Mr. Bregman? Why not give everyone healing crystals instead of healthcare? Why not curb the advance of autism by abolishing vaccines? Why not end inequality by sending an elite unit of commandos to eliminate the wealth-hoarding Illuminati?To counteract this inevitable dynamic, we must always strive to be on the side of reason, most of all when confronting those who would mischaracterize our reasonable ideas as unreasonable. And even that’s not enough. In addition to devoting ourselves to reasonable positions and actions, we must also heed the most important mantra of all: I might be wrong. You can’t do either of those things if you’re immune to criticism and flaunt your irrationality like a badge of honor.Okay, I think the reasonable thing to do now is stop ranting about the importance of being reasonable. On the whole, Utopia for Realists is an awesome book. I will especially utilize it as a default recommendation for folks who are trying to formulate a responsible but non-traditional political identity, as well as a reminder that radicalism becomes less dangerous and more palatable when coupled with research and (mostly) good thinking.This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,1,"Short review: it's garbage.Longer review, originally posted at http://sandymaguire.me/blog/utopia-fo...Rutger Bergman's Utopia for Realists is a book whose primary thesis is that we should have a guaranteed minimum income (GMI).I must admit, I was pretty sold on a guaranteed minimum income before reading this book. I hadn't thought too much about it, besides the fact that lots of smart people I know say it's a good idea, and that obviously we're going to need a solution to what happens to humans after we automate away all of the jobs.After reading this book, I am significantly less on-board with the idea.What it boils down to is that Utopia for Realists isn't very good. If these are the best arguments for a GMI, well... let's hope that they're not the best arguments for a GMI.I can't make up my mind on whether this book is merely incompetent or actively dishonest.For example, the book discusses the Speenhamland system, which it describes as an early form of GMI, and then discusses a contemporary report which described it as a failed experiment. But then Utopia for Realists turns around with the sentence ""more recent research has revealed that the Speenhamland system was actually a success."" A description of how the original study was supposedly flawed, but no citation to back it up. No reference to which ""more recent research"" reveals resounding success. There are lots of other citations in the book. Why not one here?Utopia makes some other bold claims without backing them up; here's a few that bothered me enough to mark them down: ""Ultimately, the perfect, self-regulating market proved an illusion."" ""The historian Brian Steesland... emphasizes that, had Nixon's plan gone ahead, the ramifications would have been huge... No longer would there be such a thing as the 'deserving' or 'undeserving poor' [no citation]""There was another time I wanted to check a source. The book makes a case for ""giving housing/money to homeless people is cheaper than dealing with the consequences of not"" via a case study. I'm willing to believe this; prevention is usually a better strategy than treatment. OK, fine. What I wanted to check was the cost breakdown; Utopia describes the project as costing $217 million, and being responsible for getting 6,500 people off of the streets over nine years. This struck me as being exorbitantly expensive, and I wanted to check their methodologies and math.The given citation for this ""unmitigated success"" was to a random pdf on the Utrecht municipal website which doesn't exist anymore. I didn't try any harder than this to find the document. The citation describing the experiment points to a Dutch news site (that Google annoyingly refuses to translate) that looks more like an op-ed than anything official, but more damningly, doesn't provide any links closer to the original source.Bregman's grasp of economics is pretty tenuous. For example: From a certain perspective, [Bastiat] says, breaking a window sounds like a fine idea. ""Imagine it costs six francs to repair the damage. And imagine that this creates a commercial gain of six francs---I confess there's no arguing with this reasoning. The glazier comes along, does his work, and happily pockets six francs..."" [emphasis mine]No arguing? Except that the glazier charges a fair price to replace the window, so he is only marginally better off after replacing the window, but the world has lost one window and the owner is the worse-off for it.He goes on: Unlike the manufacture of a fridge or a car, history lessons and doctor's [sic] checkups can't simply be made ""more efficient.""This is absurdly stupid. We've all taken classes that were long-winded and boring. The quality of a teacher has a huge bearing on how efficiently we learn from them. Websites like Khan Academy are teaching entire university courses in a fraction of the time it would take to do through the usual channels. Doctors' checkups can and have been made more efficient; it's not an accident that doctors carry stethoscopes and have access to MRI machines.But Bergman persists: ... the government is gobbling up a growing share of the economic pie... this phenomenon is now known as ""Baumol's cost disease,"" basically says that prices in labor-intensive sectors such as healthcare and education increase faster than prices in sectors where most of the work can be more extensively automated... shouldn't we be calling this a blessing, rather than a disease? After all, the more efficient our factories and our computers, the less efficient our healthcare and education need to be; that is, the more time we have left to attend to the old and infirm and to organize education on a more personal scale. When you're obsessed with efficient and productivity, it's difficult to see the real value of education and care. Which is why so many politicians and taxpayers alike see only the costs. They don't realize that the richer a country becomes the more it should be spending on teachers and doctors.No no no no no no. Cost disease doesn't say ""we spend too much on healthcare and education."" It says ""we spend too much on healthcare and education on the margin."" Which is to say that in less cost-diseased countries, spending an additional $1,000 will buy you a lot more than the same additional $1,000 in a more cost-diseased place.Cost disease is the phenomenon that we're paying more to get less. For example, Thailand has a booming dentistry industry among Australians because you can get the same quality work done for significantly less money. This isn't ""exploiting Thai workers"" nor is it ""taking jobs away from Australians""---it's just Australian cost disease.A significantly smaller portion of the book describes the fifteen-hour workweek is an ideal one. Sure! Sounds good! But, Bergman says, ""breaking the vicious cycle [of the 40 hour workweek] will require collective action---by companies, or better yet, by countries.""I don't get this one. If you want to work less than 40 hours, just... work less than 40 hours? Nobody is forcing you, except your spending habits. As it happens, life is actually pretty cheap. Find a small apartment, share it with some roommates, and eat a lot of rice. You can definitely manage to do it for less than $800 a month if you're willing to shop around---and especially if you're willing to move.The secret is to just not spend money. That means stop eating lavish meals. Don't get a pet. Don't buy a vehicle. Stop drinking and smoking and give up whatever other vices you have that cost a bunch of money. It sounds dumb, but the secret to not working very much is to not need a lot of money.And then use your extra time to learn how to do something valuable so that you can work even less.At the end of the day, I get the strong impression that this book was written backwards. Bergman very clearly believes in his cause, and has worked backwards trying to find arguments that support it---as evidenced by the sloppy citation work, numerous straw-men and gross-misunderstanding of the arguments against his point of view.It's a particularly bad sign when a book is so bad that it makes people on your side agree with you less after reading it. Give this one a miss, but if you're looking for a significantly better resource championing MGI, look no further than Slate Star Codex's take on same."

This is a very readable, very accessible book about concepts like UBI, open borders, and a shorter work week. Honestly it reads more like a pamphlet than a book, and I wish I had known that going in, because I wouldn't have wasted my time - which is not to say that this book isn't worthy of people's time, just that it wasn't necessarily worthy of mine. I'm not some centrist who needs to be convinced that these are good ideas, and in a lot of instances, the author isn't radical or progressive enough for me. By all means, if there's a centrist in your life who needs a push to start exploring progressive ideas like UBI, this book is probably a decent introduction. As it was, I didn't really learn anything new except for, apparently, the fact that President Nixon was a progressive in a lot of ways (an advocate for UBI and a shorter work week?? who knew). This is partly the fault of my own expectations; I thought, given the title, that this book would be a detailed look at just how policies like UBI could be implemented. I was expecting a lot of hard numbers and policy details. This is not that in the slightest. In fact one of the reasons I didn't like this book was that it gives surface-level overviews of the ideas it discusses. There's no detail, just the author skimming over a whole bunch of different things.Also, this is purely personal, but I hated the smarmy tone of the book. Something about the author's voice just bugged me."

This book is a must read. 15 hour work weeks! Universal basic Income in the most literal sense! Open borders!! I know for a lot of people it sounds crazy. But for the author we can reach utopia by achieving these; not only these though. Besides when slavery was at its peak, it was also crazy to think that one day the most influential country in the world would have a black president. It also gets preachy at times and in a good way, like how it's only robots that should be productive and humans should just procrastinate and explore the world around them, humans should educate themselves for life and not for jobs, and have more room for friends, family, community service, science, art, sports, and all the other things that make life worthwhile.I felt like the book is heavily depended on studies/ researches/ surveys which- after skimming through how to lie with statistics by Darrel Huff - I'm skeptical of. Even though im absolutely not qualified enough to criticise the ideas he discussed And if I'm to be honest it's not that I understood 100% of the content( I need a lot of growing up to do).And given that we somehow save ourselves from the climate change, I've really wanted him to take the rise of automation and AI into account and how it would affect our utopia. Maybe, just like all of us, Rutgers Bregman too doesn't have the answers to these. Maybe he is working on them right now. And let's hope he is, for i can't wait to read his new book.P.S. I still have ten more pages to read. I just didn't want goodreads to show this is the first book I finished in 2019."

I think the best part about this book is that it's drenched in optimism, of which we seem in dire short supply these days. It's extremely interesting to read studies of UBI or shorter work weeks. Perhaps the book could have done with a little more devil's advocacy, anticipating objections and counter-arguments. I think if I were to get into a debate with someone about UBI I would have no more ammunition at this point than to say, well, I read this book and it cites some studies where it apparently works. Would it work everywhere? Who knows. Let's give it a try and find out. Bregman is wry and charming in the manner of Hans Rosling or Yuval Noah Harari. And he's one of a handful of voices that is really thinking about the future, and what it means for our species if A.I. lives up to its imminent potential. It's a serious question that almost no one takes seriously: what are we going to do with ourselves if technology renders us obsolete?"

And between stories about the carbon footprint of all the private jets and what Bezos is wearing was a little clip, quickly going viral, of Rutger speaking truth to power. I figured my view of the clip (two or three views if I’m being honest) was worth at least buying the guy’s book. It’s a marvelous read: Piketty without all the math, a real view forward. It loses a star only because it’s too casual. This crisis is becoming life and death, an existential malady for humanity, and Bregman is still a cheerleader, not a warlord. This will change.

So when it came to discussions with more conservative friends I never had anything to show for accept for moral arguments. Not to say that I have a sufficient idea of economics now after having read this book but I definetly understood the points the author made and could explain them to other people. In general the concepts in this book make sense are good researched and are easy to understand. And most important for making an argument against more conservative folks: numbers are given that show his ideas are ""utopias"" that could actually work.Another reason why I liked this piece of writing so much is that it wasn´t dry at all. The author had a nice subtle humor and his arguments were often embedded in interesting historical narratives.So if you want to dive into political or economic literature but your'e afraid of endless dry ideological books I can highly recommend this one.Certainly this book is not enough and now i have to check different sources on the topics but in terms of raising interest it did a great job."

And despite all of that, we listen and nod as we're told any idea other than maintaining the status quo is pie-in-the-sky, wishy-washy, liberal Bolshevism.Enter Utopia for Realists. Rutger Bremer, of Davos fame, makes the case for radical, left-wing ideas not being dismissed straight away. He demonstrates the actual evidence of universal basic income working, of a shorter work week boosting productivity, that the best way to lift people out of poverty and reduce homelessness (and lessen the financial burden on the state) is to hand out cash, and the many benefits to getting rid of tax havens. He very articulately argues that the left need to stand their ground, not to allow the 'window of acceptable policy' to lurch ever rightwards. Did you know Margaret Thatcher, when asked what her greatest achievement was, answered with Tony Blair and New Labour? Enough said.Sure not all his suggestions are perfect and some have some pretty major drawbacks, but at least this book is full of ideas. The only way things will change, after all, is if the left continues to bring new ideas to the table and unapologetically argues for them. "

109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Bregman starts with a medieval utopia, Cockaigne, the land of plenty, and argues that we're more or less there. By this reading, politics is now just problem solving--in other words, getting everyone caught up, which seems to be closer than one might think. Then again, we also seem to face these issues: obesity, climate change, and a lack of purpose and direction. Has the utopia just once again turned into a dystopia?Blueprint utopias are problematic because they so quickly become dystopian. Arguments against utopia include futility (this can't work; let's not try), danger (the new order threatens stability; let's not try), and perversion (what makes us us will be corrupted). We see these arguments, or forms of them, in every skeptical response to policy--and the last has appeared a million times in dystopian literature.But Bregman is using utopia as a means for exploring an aspiration. It is this latter sense that Bregman worries about--i.e., that we don't seem to have any clue what to do with the wealth and prosperity we've acquired. We create utopias in order to achieve them and then create others. He looks at Fukuyama's ""End of History"" hypothesis with gratitude, but also with a sense of disappointment. Have we lost the ability to dream?But if practicality is all that floats your boat, then Bregman looks at employment and notes that economic growth is now happening as labor participation seems to be dropping. In other words, automation has arrived and humans seem to only become less important and less useful. Further, wealth appears to concentrate in fewer hands. We need to think up new systems now, why not utopian systems that we can work towards?The stack? Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature and Enlightenment Now. Rosling's Factfulness.

I then saw his TED talk, his clash with Tucker Carlson which was brilliant, and then how Andrew Yang takes a lot of his UBI theories from him.All this meant that I had to read Rutger Bregman's book. I read it right after Andrew Yang's book so a lot of the Universal Basic Income bits were familiar. His clarity and depth reminded me of Harari - not quite at the same level, but getting there.Outside of UBI, there were some ideas that seem obvious when mentioned but so radical the way the world works right now. For instance, the futility of investment bankers versus the importance of trash collectors and how we value them. Can the 15-hour work-week become a thing? How is our society so addicted to work versus being incentivized to thrive? The fact that poverty is because of a lack of cash and nothing else. He uses data and logical reasoning throughout to seriously test governing norms of today and its fascinating.An incredible notion that he surfaces is that importance of crises. In a crisis, the masses are ready to change dramatically, but what is needed is a viable, congruent theory to drive that change. Milton Friedman and his crew rode that wave with their neoliberal agenda that has made capitalism what it is today. But when the 2008 financial crisis happened, there weren't any ideas or leaders there to take advantage of using that crisis to drive seismic change.There are times when you think Bregman has an air of arrogance, but he is so rational that you have to almost allow it. This book was originally written in Dutch but he claims that it's even better in English. It's a quick read, and extremely interesting, a must read for everyone, especially if you want to tackle global poverty and don't believe in bullshit."
111,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1808251-diogenes,5,"I’m not sure how realistic this book is, but if we can take Bregman’s data at true face-value, Utopia for Realists is an awe-inspiring endeavor meant to shake the foundations of neoliberal capitalism (and all the lies its sown within any populace) down to its very arthritic bones. “Be realistic, demand the impossible! rang the rallying cry of the Paris demonstrators in 1968. The end of slavery, the emancipation of women, the rise of the welfare state—all were progressive ideas that started out as crazy and ‘irrational' but were ultimately accepted as basic common sense” (p. 209). The system that is must be expunged, rebuilt, transmogrified, and the Green New Deal manifesto seems to be a beacon of light in an otherwise dimly lit tunnel of greed, selfishness, and mindless ignorance/cognitive dissonance now led by a bloated egotist who has never worked an honest day of hard labor in his pathetic life. The data suggest this ideal can happen anywhere. Nixon of all people was on the cusp of casting such a bold plan, but ultimately failed, as in so many other acts, due to faulty intelligence, fomenting common myths that still permeate to this day (https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/ri...). Think about an alternative future that could have been kick-started 40 years ago, and where we could have been NOW. Chicago could be like Tokyo, where even hunched-over grandmothers can use light rail to get to anywhere they need to, instead of a gridlocked traffic web belching massive quantities of CO into the upper atmosphere. If we do not severely change the system, we are doomed to the drastic inequality that persists today and all the symptomatic repercussions that inequality breeds. “Today, the richest 8% earn half of all the world’s income, and the richest 1% own more than half of all wealth. The poorest billion people account for just 1% of all consumption; the richest billion, 72%” (p. 192). As the recent South Africa corruption scandal highlights, this issue is pervasive globally (https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019...), chronically. Bregman’s Dutch optimism is infectious. If we choose to see one another as part of a holistic collective, given the exact same rights, bestowed a life of quality and fulfillment, freed from the vices of poverty, need, and scarcity, why can’t we share the wealth, level the playing field, and embrace the Buddhist tenet of eliminating suffering around this blue-marble globe? The money and resources are there; they just need to be used more wisely, for the most people, and for the greatest good. “Now is the time to finally let go of pointless distinctions between the deserving and undeserving poor people. Now is the time to move beyond the fallacy that a life without poverty is a privilege you have to work for, rather than a right we all deserve.” This book is a short, succinct treatise on imagining a better world in the twenty-first century. Many dispel it as liberal fantasy, and sadly it might be. The powers-that-be are deeply entrenched in their capitalistic rapacity, and they could care less about the future of your children, and their grandchildren. Every piece of plastic I see drifting across the highway on my commute to and from work among the bleak wastelands of Nevada (and there is SO much of it), is a testament to human laziness, and a harbinger of what’s to come. However, many of the youth are taking up the torch, as Jamie Margolin (age 17) recently wrote (https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...), and Emily Atkin and Brian Kahn wrote for Gizmodo/The New Republic (https://newrepublic.com/article/15441...). Margolin hammers history home with, “Colonialism’s mindset of heedless extraction, greed and human exploitation not only planted the seeds of today’s climate crisis, it remains visible in the crisis’s central injustice: although the poor are responsible for only a tiny share of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, they generally suffer first and worst from the heatwaves, droughts, storms, rising seas and other effects of those emissions.” Perhaps the band Stick to Your Guns is hopefully right, “The kids will save themselves!” (Dove and Fist, 2019). It takes time to make incredible paradigm shifts, but that is exactly what is needed as soon as humanly possible. “[T]he inability to imagine a world in which things are different is evidence only of a poor imagination, not of the impossibility of change” (p. 165). We need to rage against the machine. We faceless citizens hold the reins to the animal. We cast the ballots and elect the legislators. Our purchasing power tells corporations how to behave. We make the choices on how we help—or how we harm—the future. Whom we choose to lead obviously has drastic effects on our lives. If we make better choices, we can creep towards a utopia that suits the majority, and let the billionaires and their perfectly engineered sex robots live on Mars, at least until their robots rise up and Bobbitt them, tossing the detritus into space, and starting the littering of the solar system while making their own Utopia far away from the reach of homo sapien stupidicus. In all seriousness, the seismic shift will take sacrifices. Nobody needs a McLaren, or a Zombie-Apocalypse Jeep. Everyone needs a ride to work, and to the grocery store, but even groceries could be ordered in bulk via smartphone, and delivered via electric trucks on scheduled timetables. We could all use electric lawnmowers, have solar panels on our roofs, help neighbors out, buy less junk, create less waste. It just takes the will to want a better world for us, our families, our communities, and the planet Herself—collectively—in our ways of thinking, and in the application of the resources we already possess. The Second Machine Age is here, erasing more human jobs with every coming year, exacerbating swelling inequality, and fomenting greater dissent at the systems of power in place. We either make the herculean shift to a better world for the 90%, or we drown in our own myopic madness already well underway. “Ideas, however outrageous, have changed the world, and they will again” (p. 206).   Let us “underdog socialists” (and everyone else who cares) strive to make that statement true. ***Two worthwhile reviews of this title:https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/m...https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/b..."

It was filled with half-truths, random jumps to conclusions, contradictions, and assumptions that correlation equals causation. Terrible. I will say though, it presents some interesting examples surrounding the terrible arguments it makes. Mind you, it's not the ideas itself I take issue with. They're just presented so poorly. I don't believe letting my views whether or not I agree serve as a pass for such poorly laid out arguments. There are also so many instances where the author just says Africa, which is an entire continent with different cultures and demographics. Many times, countries in North America and Europe are broken down, acknowledging that the US is not Canada is not the UK is not Belgium. Africa just seems to serve as a nebulous poor, backwards country. I gave this book a real chance. I read every word. The arguments are really bad. It lacks perspective. It's told from a very privileged view with no self-awareness. The sources are questionable in too many cases. There are too many contradictions that are never reconciled. The arguments rely on flimsy evidence and often doesn't bother to prove whether or not any of the data or situations are actually connected. If you're interested in the concepts presented here like open borders, shorter workweeks, and universal basic income, don't read this book. Almost anything else would be better than this."
113,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64241555-robert-s,1,"Utopia for Realists on its face is a book I would find thoroughly enjoyable. Its a relatively breezy read where the author advocates for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) and a 15 hour workweek. The author also strongly advocates for open borders without really ever defining what that means exactly.The author seems to be under the impression that a 15-hour workweek and UBI happens alone and instead of in a vacuum. It would probably have helped to consider the need for stronger education, healthcare, infrastructure, and regulations in place for either idea to truly work.A UBI would quickly be eaten due to rising cost of rent (never mind property) in a land without rent controls. The knowledge of everyone receiving a bare minimum income without the corresponding regulations in place to make sure its not taken advantage would be too tempting.I do think that the twin ideas can work in the long run but not in the way represented here.Also it was truly strange to see the author lauding Hayek and Friedman while randomly going after the ""left"" and propping up neoliberalism. It came completely out of left field and really put a bad taste in the mouth of the end of the book."

He lays out the evidence demonstrating that measures like universal basic income, a 15-hour workweek, and open borders--all of which could benefit all of us in strictly economic, as well as making the world a better, happier place. And for those who say that these are impossible dreams--he points out that sensible people once said the same about democracy, abolition, and women's suffrage. Every utopia is impossible until it's realized, and then it becomes inevitable. But first we have to be thinking about and planning for those impossible dreams."

For me, the most valuable part of the book was toward the end, where Bregman writes about how change happens, and what it will take to see these ideas accepted in the popular mindset.

130,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1509780-april,4,"I don't normally read a lot of non-fiction and I can't remember when I have ever read anything about the economy, but a few months ago I saw an interview with Rutger Bregman talking about his book Utopia for Realists and I was intrigued. It was entirely likely that I would reserve the book from the library, flip through a few pages and decide it wasn't going to actually be readable- not by me, anyway. I did just go on and on in my last review about how little patience I have with books that don't capture my attention. Well, no one could be more surprised than I was to find myself completely absorbed with concepts I knew absolutely nothing about before opening this book.According to Bregman, we need to drastically change some of our economic beliefs if we want to make the world a better, and more profitable, place. He talks about a universal basic income, shorter work weeks, and significant changes to immigration laws. These ideas will sound entirely too radical for many people, but Bregman does a good job of explaining how they work and what it could mean for society. Here are a few points that stood out to me: Lest there be any misunderstanding: It is capitalism that opened the gates to the Land of Plenty, but capitalism alone cannot sustain it.On the topic of international relief: The great thing about money (actual cash) is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need. And, as it happens, there is one category of product which poor people do not spend free money on and that's alcohol and tobacco. In fact, a major study by the World Bank demonstrated that in 82% of all researched cases in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, alcohol and tobacco consumption actually declined.Did you know that Nixon was in the process of passing a bill to provide a basic income in the 1970s, but a study found that the divorce rate among those participating in an experiment in Seattle jumped more than 50%? My first thought was that when women have the financial means to support themselves, they are no longer forced to stay in bad marriages. This rise in the divorce rate was enough to change the opinion of politicians supporting it despite all the other outcomes, such as better school performance and improvements in health. A basic income, evidently, gave women too much independence. Sadly, it was discovered a decade later that there had been a statistical error and that the divorce rate hadn't actually changed at all.There were several studies that illustrated that the cost of poverty and homelessness (health care, social services, police, and court costs) is actually more than what it would cost to provide a basic income which has been shown to be more successful anyway. In Utah, in 2005, in an effort to combat homelessness, housing became a right. Free apartments were provided for those in need and it was actually a windfall for the state budget. State economists calculated that a drifter living on the street cost the government $16,670 a year. An apartment plus professional counseling, by contrast, cost a modest $11,000.It may be an unpopular topic among some, but raising taxes on top earners has been shown to improve not only society at large, but actually the economy as well. Not all work is created equal- an investment banker or hedge fund manager may make a lot of money, but doesn't actually create anything. A builder fills a need, but doesn't make as much income. For every dollar a bank earns, an estimated equivalent of 60 cents is destroyed elsewhere in the economic chain. Conversely, for every dollar a researcher earns, a value of at least $5 - and often more - is pumped back into the economy. … In plain English: Higher taxes would get more people to do work that's useful.Regarding immigration, Bregman suggests that open boarders would be the solution to many problems, but if you're not ready to go quite that far, he says: Even just cracking the door would help. If all the developed countries would let in just 3% more immigrants, the world's poor would have $305 billion more to spend, say scientists at the World Bank. That's the combined total of all development aid - times three.These ideas may all be a bit hard to swallow, but Bregman explains them in a way that certainly does make the reader curious about what could be. The author does not browbeat his readers, nor does he discount the concerns they may have. He simply presents the information with the hope that it will educate and enlighten. I found this book fascinating and very accessible. I am sure there is a lot I don't understand, but this gives me something to consider and maybe even hope for in the future.I think this book could be an excellent conversation starter if you thought your book club could handle it. Money and politics can be tricky, but they are important conversations to have."
131,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14139887-david-buccola,3,"My three star review is generous. It's influenced by the fact that the general ideas espoused are decent while the ""realist"" part is awful. Any decent person should be able to get behind a shorter work week, universal income, and a world without borders. The ideas are fine, and I won't spend much time here quibbling with the way they are presented. But remember this is a book for realists. It's supposedly a book aimed at pragmatists who are going to get things going; change the world!First of all none of these ideas are new. None. And so obviously Bregman needs to explain why these things haven't come to fruition already. He rhetorically asks, ""What are the socialists doing wrong? They're dull. They don't have command of the facts."" And--here's the best one--""Those on the Left like losing."" Let's unpack this a bit.First off Bregman omits the incredible and savage violence meted out to socialists, communists, anarchists, labor leaders, feminists, indigenous movement leaders, black liberation leaders and the third world in general. The United States alone has invaded and overthrown over 40 democratically elected governments around the world since the second world war. Even as recently as 2012 when Clinton aided the Honduran military in overthrowing their democratically elected president who happened to try and raise the minimum wage a few pennies. Here in the bastion of Democracy we have programs like COINTEL Pro carried about by the FBI that used every dirty tool in the book including outright assassination to stymy any move toward a more progressive future. Leaders of these movements like Leonard Peltier--jailed--or Fred Hampton--murdered. Dead people do tend to be dull. Need I even mention the number of third world leaders that have been disposed, murdered or removed: Nasser, Lumumba, Mosedeq, Allende, Arbenz and many more. There is nothing real about omitting this very real violence, sabotage and subterfuge carried out to make sure the very things you are espousing in your book never come to fruition. ""They don't have command of the facts."" This is just silly. As Michael Parenti has often pointed out the facts are Leftist. By that he means the rising inequality, the ecological crisis, the plight of the precarious worker here and abroad and a host of other social ills all require a turn to the Left. Luminaries on the Left from Noam Chomsky to Naomi Klein and a host of others not only have command of the facts but have written stacks of books on these facts. The left is drowning in facts. ""The Left like losing."" This is just crazy once you understand what losing means in the real world. Losing means getting beaten by police. It means having your village raised by Contra Death squads financed by the CIA. It means being murdered in your sleep by the FBI. It means being imprisoned for exposing war crimes committed by the United States Government. Bregman naively assumes that if we were just more charismatic, had better command of the facts and didn't like losing so much that miraculously we could overcome the most violent and sociopathic ruling elite the world has ever known. That's not realistic. And while, yes, the various policy ideas espoused here are realistic and would go a long way toward making this a better world, it's the very unrealistic ways in which Bregman thinks this could happen that hurt this book. He mentions organizing once in passing. He briefly mentions the need for a new labor movement. That is, the most important things we could be doing to push forward these ideas--organizing and revitalizing the labor movement--are only mentioned in passing. This book should be more accurately titled, ""Utopia for dreamers"" because there is nothing realistic about ignoring the fact that we currently live in a Plutocracy that is ruled by an interlocking set of institutions that will do anything--including killing the very planet we all depend on--in order to protect their class privilege. If you're not familiar with the arguments for a shorter work week, a world without borders or universal basic income there is good information here. But don't expect any realistic ideas for how we might implement them. "

Now less than 10% of Americans are in that category. Between 1974 and 2014, internet usage rose from 0.4% to 40.4%.People who had less than 2000 calories/day fropped from 51% in 1965 to 3% in 2005.

War casualties have gone down 90% since 1946.However, millions still live in poverty, while “we are rich enough to put an end to it.” Health care in the U.S. costs more than anywhere else, but our life expectancy is going down.Bergman then reports on various experiments to study the economic impact of providing a basic income to various limited populations:1) Liberia gave alcoholics, addicts and petty criminals the equivalent of $200 per time period. Three years later, those people had spent it on food, clothes, meds and small business.2) War on Poverty 1964—President Nixon saw his basic income bill as a “marriage of conservative and progressive policies.” 8500 people in 7 states were given a basic income. None worked less. More stayed in high school. The program was not too expensive, and the jobless were required to register. It failed in part because of “His (Nixon’s) rhetoric, saying that fighting laziness among the poor and unemployed would turn the country against basic income…[calling it a] welfare state.” The “myth of the lazy poor” held strong, in spite of studies to the contrary.In 1968, five economists (Galbraith) wrote to Congress, stating that the country’s responsibility is to assure that everyone in the nation has an income no less than the definition of poverty. 1200 other economists signed it and Congress nearly passed a basic income, arguing how much it should be. However, it was defeated in 1978 when a study in Seattle providing basic income to more than a 1000 peopled indicated that their divorce rate had gone up 50%. With basic income support, bureaucratic help becomes unnecessary--security and a sense of belonging means people feel empowered to find work, start businesses and stay off alcohol and drugs. Red tape only produces more dependence. Social workers, police and courts cost $16,670 per year for each street drifter. The Netherlands had similar results.Utah in 2005 provided free apartments to the homeless for $11,000 per year each, and saw homelessness decline 74%. At the same time, without aid to the homeless, Wyoming’s homeless numbers increased 213 %.Once again, the security provided by enough money to feed and house one’s family gave people the drive to enhance their lives. Financial stress is known to increase cognitive impairment, so that people in despair take to drugs and alcohol, and they lose jobs. If basic income is distributed as a universal “right” to all, so it is provided equally to everyone, it does not drive a wedge between the poor and the rest of society. It is now recognized (Bergman says in 2014) that eradicating poverty would cost 175 billion/year, equal to ¼ of military expenditures. Afghanistan and Iraq have cost us 4-6 trillion! We need to challenge our priorities."

Something about the way he makes his arguments - straight-to-the point, yet hopeful and forward-thinking - really appeals to me, so I was quickly drawn in by Utopia’s premise. Not only does Bregman make the case for “castle in the sky” projects like a shorter work week, universal income, and open borders, but all of these goals are couched in the language of utopic thinking. Society in general, Bregman argues, has ceased to imagine what a better world could look like. Without such an imagination, we tend to stagnate and reinforce the status quo of the moment. I found this framework extremely compelling; while Bregman could have written a tome solely in terms of economics, his framework of “utopia” serves to inspire and motivate readers, rather than overwhelm them with studies and statistics.Furthermore, I appreciated that this book was written to appeal to people who are more conservative or right-leaning. While one can make arguments for UBI, a 15-hour work week, etc. in terms of morality, Bregman backs up every case with evidence from economists, psychologists, etc. and tackles opposing arguments head-on. As a result, the barriers to “utopic” projects are clearly the will to carry them out.I don’t know enough about economics to judge whether or not all of Bregman’s arguments are sound, but I do think some of his arguments about “the left” and moral superiority could have been phrased better. While I don’t think he was saying that struggles for gender and racial equality were wastes of time, or that even the poorest black Americans should be grateful for what they have because it’s miles better than what it was in the past, I do think the attitude he took about allowing the sense of moral superiority to hinder progress could have come off that way to some readers. I also was not a fan of the way he framed history, saying that everything was worse in the past (maybe it was, in some ways, but I don’t think we can universally pass judgment on the past that way). Lastly, I think more time could have been devoted to open borders, as it felt like that topic was covered less than UBI or shorter work weeks.That being said, the strongest parts of this book were when Bregman was addressing the studies that proved UBI, open borders, and a shorter work week would benefit people in general. I don’t think he had all the answers for every problem that could be related to these policies, nor does Bregman give a detailed plan for implementing them, but I don’t think that’s the purpose of the book. It’s not an economic or political how-to guide, but a general inspiration for readers to dream bigger and look beyond the present moment. Overall, I think Utopia for Realists was an accessible read, especially for those who find politics and economics overwhelming, and provides a nice introduction to the concepts it covers."
134,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18639418-kerry,4,"This book is full of startling statistics and quotable passages. The section about the benefits of a universal basic income is enlightening and thought-provoking; the ability it has to improve educational opportunities and reduce spending on stop-gap measures is reason enough to look more into this topic, even as some countries experiment with their own universal basic income programs. Bregman says: Already, research has correlated unconditional cash disbursements with reductions in crime, child mortality, malnutrition, teenage pregnancy, and truancy, and with improved school performance, economic growth, and gender equality.He also demonstrates how some measures put in place to combat poverty or expenditure on people who may ""take advantage"" of the system are only keeping poor people poor by erecting barriers to their getting help.You might imagine that all the rules and paperwork serve to putoff those who aren't genuinely needy. But in fact, it works the other way around: The poor--those whose bandwidth is already overtaxed, whose need is greatest--are the least likely to ask Uncle Sam for help.Bregman exposes many myths about poverty, the economy, borders, and the length of the work week that create an endless and growing cycle of discrimination, the wage gap, and productivity. The section on open borders and immigration alone could be expanded and turned into another book, which, admittedly, might only appeal to those who already agree with the author on some of the many great points made.The one section that isn't well-argued, however, is the one about the reduced work week. While what Bergman says makes sense (with a reduced work week, workers are more productive, contribute to society in a multitude of positive ways, and feel more fulfilled), he doesn't describe how to reconcile the idea with the lower pay that workers would get as a result. If that isn't what he is saying, he also doesn't explain whether he envisions a world where a shortened work week wouldn't mean less pay. He also doesn't merge two main ideas of the book: the shortened work week with a universal basic income--should these two ideas work together, and if so, how?Also left out of the narrative is a point that seems obvious: people in power don't want to the status quo to change because that would mean a decrease in status and wealth. This book is a balm for cynics who find day-to-day life in the overworked world of zombie consumerism frustrating at best and unbearable at most. Utopia is an ideal, and while Bregman doesn't necessarily make it feel attainable (particularly in our lifetime), he does show how science demonstrates that some of its tenets play out in such a way to benefit everyone positively where they have been studied and tested."
135,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60292191-eb,4,"I can’t help but think that some of Rutger Bregman’s assertions in Utopia for Realists, albeit optimistic to the point of inspirational, lack the necessary context to understanding the reality which he discusses. Take his admiration of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman towards the end of the book. He writes “Together, they tore apart that cocoon [of mainstream thought], upending the world in a way dictators and billionaires can only dream of” (pg. 244). The problem is that billionaires didn’t just dream the same dreams. They bankrolled them. Hayek and Freidman didn’t toil in a sociopolitical vacuum. Reading Naomi Klein’s Shock Doctrine, anyone can realize that these men were successful to the extent that they came of age at a time of big business and big government, and I would contend that their ideas were ripe for cooptation by those driven by economic greed and political power. Perhaps the author is just trying to be charitable to two intellectuals with which he likely disagrees on most linchpin issues, however admiringly. Or maybe I’m just reading too much into the part where he decided “to hell with historical non-fiction, what I really want to do is prose!” Still, there were parts of the book like this where I found myself thinking “I’ve really got to stop reading this soft-boiled stuff.”And if you’re wondering why I would begin a review with such a negative mindset despite giving the book 4 stars, it’s because I’m lazy and not very good at this. I make notes to myself as I’m reading to save time, and the above paragraph is all that I’d managed to spit out. Perhaps if I worked the author’s suggested 15 hours a week rather than 50+, I’d have more time to develop some modicum of competence. But here we are, living a neoliberal nightmare.Despite it’s somewhat casual approach sociopolitical context, history, and economic principles, Utopia for Realists is an enjoyable read in which I felt like I gained new and improved insight into things that I might have supported based on mere intuition or tribalism before. His final words of advice, which he addresses to “underdog socialists” but could just as well be offered to the left-leaning and liberal-minded, are well-made and essentially amount to “there’s more of us than them, so focus local and don’t be such a wimp” (my words, not his). Bregman has a persuasive way of discussing the ideas, and I also appreciate his introspection in admitting how much he is personally invested in their truth. He has a tendency to put everything in the larger picture of all that led to this moment, even if he does skim over some timelines and factoids, and more than anything I appreciate his mindset that everything was impossible until someone did it."

Besides that author analyzes current trends and gives a lot of real life examples to prove that his ideas might work. I am not an economist and have rather a basic knowledge of economic principles, but may say, that some of his ideas seem to be very realistic. The only idea about open borders globally looks for me neither working nor reliable. Definitely worth reading it, if you want to have a bigger picture of how our world and especially its economic processes are running.Below some quotes: « All the while, the market and commercial interests are enjoying free reign. The food industry supplies us with cheap garbage loaded with salt, sugar, and fat, putting us on the fast track to the doctor and dietitian. Advancing technologies are laying waste to ever more jobs, sending us back again to the job coach. And the ad industry encourages us to spend money we don’t have on junk we don’t need in order to impress people we can’t stand.25 Then we can go cry on our therapist’s shoulder.That’s the dystopia we are living in today.»«Time and again, we blame collective problems like unemployment, dissatisfaction, and depression on the individual. If success is a choice, then so is failure. Lost your job? You should have worked harder. Sick? You must not be leading a healthy lifestyle. Unhappy? Take a pill.»«We may be living in the age of individualism, but our societies have never been more dependent on one another...The British economist Alfred Marshall already noted this dynamic back in the late 19th century: The smaller the world gets, the fewer the number of winners»«The reality is that it takes fewer and fewer people to create a successful business, meaning that when a business succeeds, fewer and fewer people benefit.»«There’s a key distinction though between people with busy lives and those living in poverty: You can’t take a break from poverty.»«Naturally, we should still take pride in the liberty that generations before us fought for and won. But the question is, what is the value of free speech when we no longer have anything worthwhile to say? What’s the point of freedom of association when we no longer feel any sense of affiliation? What purpose does freedom of religion serve when we no longer believe in anything?»"
137,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56125385-elina-salminen,5,"I'm giving this book five stars because you should read it. You should read it if you already buy into (ha!) ideas such as universal income, open-ish borders, a radical redistribution of global wealth, and a shorter workweek. It will be a fortifying balm for your soul. You should read it if you pointedly don't buy into those ideas, so that you can get some actual data on social experiments that seem utopian and bound to lead to laziness and corruption. (Spoiler alert: most signs point toward that not being true.)For all my posturing as a leftist globalist, many of the studies and figures in the book surprised me. I didn't realize just how drastically even relatively minor infusions of cash, such as $10,000 for a family of four a year, could affect outcomes from education to employment to health to happiness. (No, $10k a year is not a small sum, but it pales in comparison to hundreds of thousands in hospital fees, the massive welfare bureaucracy, etc.) To my shame, I didn't fully believe that poor people, when given free money, would use it in ways I deem worthwhile and productive and would do the *opposite* of sitting on their butts all day. It's telling that even as I was reading the book, and even as I'm writing this review, I'm tempted to put on my cynic's hat, critiquing the fact that he cites the Daily Telegraph alongside peer-reviewed articles, pointing out that he doesn't address the environmental consequences of the entire world getting rich, and noting that GiveDirectly, one of the examples he cites as a resounding success, has since tempered its statements about the success of the program. And, of course, dismiss it as, well, a utopia.But, as Rutger Bregman argues, we need to dream big and shift the ""window of acceptability."" If enough people are idealists, those ideas suddenly become feasible - and not in the ""anything is possible if you just dream!"" sense, but in the sense that public opinion guides political discussion and decision-making, and public opinion can be influenced by a few loud people - for better or for worse. And he makes a really good case for ""why not?"" and shows that the answers are too often irrational, based on pettiness and misguided ideas. The ideas he talks about are not impossible, nor will they lead to the apocalypse, but they do require calling bullshit on the current form of capitalism and trusting that the zero-sum game that is the global economy can be restructured in fairer ways."
138,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33738834-peter,5,"I find that big, potentially world-changing ideas are always fun to read about, even if they aren't necessarily that attainable. It's probably why I love fantasy and sci-fi so much. With this book though, I found the realistic grounding of the ideas extremely interesting, thought-provoking and mostly doable. I've read about all the main concepts before and so I, unfortunately, came in with a bit of a bias in favour of them already. However, the way the topics were laid out and discussed was very insightful, even though there were a few digressions and minor inconsistencies along the way.With this being a translation, I was pleasantly surprised by how the writing was easily readable and genuinely funny. From the quotes to the anecdotes, the content felt well researched and thought out. It was also quite short and quick which had both positives and negatives. However, I think keeping it on the shorter side was probably for the best since you could easily write an entire book on each topic. This way, more people are less likely to get burnt out with all that new information.That being said, I would have liked to see more discussions on some of the opposing views to the ideas though. There were a lot of consequences to the ideas that weren't really touched on and whenever I read something that's too one-sided, I get a bit suspicious. There was also a lack of concrete, practical milestones on how to get to those ideals. Just saying that progress happens in fits and starts and that pushing for big ideas makes the smaller steps sound more reasonable is still a bit too vague for me. However, I don't think those gripes are necessarily detrimental to the book. In fact, I think that they're a great jumping-off point for the types of real-world discussions the content deserves. I'm still thinking through them as I write this review and wondering about whether a 15-hour workweek is really the sweet spot. Why not base it on what the job and the people doing it actually require? That might mean longer hours for some and less for others. And I think that's the point of this book. It stimulates the kinds of thinking that more people should be having and proliferating, even if you don't agree with them. Hence why this is worth all 5 stars and definitely worth the couple of hours it would take to read."

Rutger Bregman acknowledging all the progress that has been made through history by human beings. To me, it is like Bregman is zooming into the Level 4 income countries first (people that make more than 32 $/day, Factfulness) and pointing out the problems there, afterward extending it to all over the world. Like why do we have more depression, performance anxiety, early-career burnout, unemployment, dissatisfaction, and these kinds of mental health problems, even though we are richer? Why do we still have poverty? What about inequality? He also critics the current metrics to measure the growth, like GDP, as is not a comprehensive key indicator to represent all types of growth.So his solution is to stop for a moment, see if we are on the right track, and ask ourselves, is this really what we want? And then thinking out of the box, being unreasonable and suggesting radical solutions. “It is time to go back to politics and find a new Utopia”. Why should we manage a problem instead of completely solving it? In his suggested Utopia, there will be basic income for all, more tax on wealthier, 15-hour week work, and open borders. For sure, these suggestions do not fit the status quo and therefore seem crazy! He made examples of similar ones, the end of slavery, the emancipation of women, etc., that are common sense today!2.	There was somewhere in the book that the author was saying that being poor nowadays and especially in a rich country is entirely different from the past. Your expectation will be made based on the people around you. Today your career defines who you are, and on the other hand, technologies and robots are taking over the jobs. Now I want you to imagine that you are well-educated, average skilled, and unemployed. It sucks, huh? But why should it be like that? What about the average? How many “Linchpins” can we have? All the low hanging fruits are already taken and it will be more challenging to find an opportunity. Well, absolutely fueling the inequality! 3.	Swedes have a concept or philosophy, “Lagom”, meaning “not too little, not too much, just right”. Reading this book popped it out in my mind again and again; let everybody has a share. 4.	I will continue searching for critics of this fantastic book by economists and politicians. But you read and enjoy being puzzled!"
140,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,4,"Rutger Bregman (translated by Elizabeth Manton) argues that our societal development has stalled because nobody in politics is promoting ""visionary"" ideas any more, but rather simply different versions of the same basic model of society. He cites examples such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage as visionary ideas which were once seen as outlandish but have come to be societal norms, and suggests that few are promoting equivalent causes today.I couldn't disagree more. In the last decade, we have seen monumental changes in society and there are fierce debates about how these should be handled. The web has brought true freedom of publication, and there are fierce debates on whether fake news and abuse should be curtailed by restricting that freedom or by managing the consequences. Social media has brought a radical degree of sharing of information unseen in human history, and politicians argue non-stop about the degree to which consent to use that information should be implied or explicit. (Hello, GDPR). Voters across the Western world have expressed a strong feeling against technocracy, preferring to elect politicians on the basis of personality rather than technical skill, and there are fervent discussions about whether democracy is reaching its natural conclusion. These are all monumental debates about the very heart of society: I cannot agree with the premise that nobody is ""thinking big thoughts"".All of that said: I really enjoyed Bregman's book. He describes - though is explicit in saying that he is not intending to promote, whatever the press coverage may imply - three radical changes to society, namely a universal basic income, a 15-hour work week, and a world without borders. With the possible exception of the latter, I don't think any of these is actually particularly radical, which is a shame given his central thesis. He discusses each of these optimistically, drawing on evidence to suggest that each would be beneficial. He does this deftly, mixing in anecdote and data in a really engaging way, which caused me to think very carefully about these ideas. The booked helped me to look at society from a couple of new perspectives.In other words, I thought this was a great book, even though I disagreed profoundly with its central thesis."
141,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5087792-melba,4,"I initially had mixed reactions as I began reading this book.....for starters I kept thinking that for a book entitled ""Utopia for Realists"" that it seemed pretty idealistic. I was motivated, however, to keep reading because Bregman wrote the book in a much needed effort to fix the ominously persistent problem of the ever increasing inequality in the distribution of wealth across the world. He asks the questions, ""Why have we been working harder and harder since the 1980s despite being richer than ever? Why are millions of people still living in poverty when we are more than rich enough to put an end to it once and for all? And why is more than 60% of your income dependent on the country where you just happen to have been born?"" The three fixes Bregman is proposing include 1) a universal basic income, 2) a shorter work week, and, 3) open borders. The bulk of the book involves providing his rational for each supported by historical information to support his thinking. Each solution is intriguing and I learned some fascinating/surprising historical facts along the way (like Richard Nixon, during his presidency, was very close to supporting a universal basic income in the U.S.). I found myself, however, wanting more specific information detailing how these would be implemented in the world in which we currently find ourselves living.Towards the end of the book Bregman tackles the issue of people's resistance to change, their limited capacity to accept new information that challenges their established mindset, and how the internet seems to make sure it feeds us mostly what we want to hear. He explains how the power of cognitive dissonance is a frightening force that keeps us from reflecting and growing. ""When reality clashes with our deepest convictions, we'd rather recalibrate reality than amend our worldview. Not only that we become even more rigid in our beliefs than before"". This part of the book was strikingly if not disturbingly relevant to the deep divide in thinking of people in today's political environment. I appreciated his honestly in recognizing how his own thinking can fall victim to cognitive dissonance. This is a book worth reading even if you do not believe in what he is saying.....maybe the purpose for reading it could be to challenge your own cognitive dissonance."

This is a very light, accessible read for popular audiences, but i mean it as a high, remarkable compliment here.Writing for popular audiences is not an easy task, as seen by the landfill of badly written, click-baity ""pop history"" or ""pop science""drivel you find in bookstores these days, which try too hard to be Amusing and Humorous, usually by recourse to shitting on scholars, theorists, thinkers or animals whom they don't like in what these authors imagine to be Funny prose, but is just bloated, badly edited writing. The overall effect is like eating a badly-made macaron in a pretentious, overpriced cafe. By contrast, Bregman here offers us a tightly written, engaging work that treats its subject matter, themes and topics thoughtfully and carefully. Every historical figure, theorist and thinker (even the notorious Richard Nixon) Bregman brings up is accorded care and respect. It may be a small thing, but it is something i appreciate of this writer. The ideas and evidence mustered to support his arguments are succinctly linked together, so that one comes away feeling powerfully persuaded by the writing. It has been a long time since I have read something so hopeful, so audacious, and so likable! And that's perhaps my biggest criticism with this very digestible piece - that it's so positive, so accessibly written, that skepticism almost inevitably begs itself: if things are so la-di-dah and so smooth, why hasn't Universal Basic Income, or a 15-Hour Workweek been implemented anywhere else in the world more consistently? Bregman's narrative seems to suggest that the answer is largely ""accidents"" and ""freak missed opportunities"". I would have liked if he had wrestled more seriously with some of the complexities of the historical events he brings up. As a opening salvo, a rallying cry for dreaming bigger, for grander dreams of a more equal world though, this book electrified me, admonished me for having become mired and blinkered in my small corner of the world. Highly recommended as a gateway drug into dreaming bigger, seeing further - by seeing 'backward' into the past."
143,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13687692-niamh,4,"Utopia. It's a subject often resigned for cynics and politicians laughing at the Left. Dystopia is much more in vogue currently. Whether we're reading it in contemporary fiction or actually living it under the rule of a talking tangerine, we don't often think about utopia and how, perhaps, it is actually viable. Something we could really make happen. Bregman, a Dutch writer, makes the case for a 'realistic utopia' in our modern world, exploring matters of economics, basic income, avoiding financial crises, man versus machine, ending poverty and eradicating homelessness, among other things. Not only does he propose solutions for what we consider societies most difficult and constant problems, but he provides real world examples of where these experiments are happening and, most importantly, succeeding. Out of all of his anecdotes, my favourite was about Ireland during the 1970s that managed to sustain their economy and even make it grow without the use of big banks. Instead, they used their local pubs as a way of creating their own currency, generating income into the millions. It seems ridiculous and possibly fictional, but it really provides a dose of reality to what we believe can only be a myth. Ultimately, he's making the case that we can make a difference and not have it break the bank. Even conservative thinkers have been brought around to this way of 'make utopia a reality' thinking- he cites Richard Nixon several times throughout the book. This is a really interesting and really digestible non-fiction piece that forces us to examine how we can solve our social problems, bypassing the government relying on opinions and beliefs, and how we can deliver actual help to those who need it. I would recommend anyone feeling disheartened by the state of the world currently to pick this book up because it will remind you that there is a way to do this and make a difference. It's not impossible. "

Hayek, etc.The books starts off by recounting a lot of coincidences and unfortunate events which prevented the adoption of an unconditional basic income.In the beginning the author argues for a different look at the economy, ""gross domestic product"" is not a suitable measurement, but later he uses the predicted growth of the ""gross worldwide product"" as an argument.He talks about opening all borders as the best development aid, but only rebuts straw man arguments against the idea.I haven't counted, but he seems to use more newspaper articles than scientific papers in his arguments.Then there is a detour about ""bloodletting"" and randomistas.Like this review the book misses a common theme. It seems inconsistent and the arguments lack a strong scientific foundation and are not very well thought out.It's a collection of ideas, findings and bold quotes by famous people that have been floating around for a while and that you probably have heard of before.I was especially disappointed because I support a lot of these ideas and I had hoped for strong arguments and a coherent world view instead of just bits and pieces."
145,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41603397-margaret,3,"Pretty un-rigorous and overly broad. I picked this up because I was interested in universal basic income, but this is a very shallow overview. It would be helpful to have an experienced economist's take - especially on whether they would project that UBI would cause inflation or major price increases. It seems that UBI is vulnerable to misuse, too - I can easily imagine conservative politicians funding it out of taxes on the middle and working classes, and denying UBI to undocumented people. On that note, like Bregman I support open borders, although I cannot imagine making the concessions Bregman is willing to make: ""Countries [with open borders] could decide not to give immigrants the right to government assistance or not until after a minimum number of years, or not until they've paid, say, $50,000 in taxes. And you could set up similar parameters if you're concerned they form a political threat or won't integrate. You can create language and culture tests. You can withhold the right to vote. And you can send them back if they don't find a job."" $50,000 in taxes? It seems to me this would create a precarious, disenfranchised class of people within the borders of wealthy countries - much like the predicament undocumented immigrants face now. Hardly a utopia. Bregman also devotes a section to Esther Duflo's work on poverty. Duflo advocates using randomized controlled trials to find out ""what works"" in developmental aid. I am not particularly drawn to this approach. My own bias is towards simply asking local leadership and the people you would like to help what they want and what they would find helpful, rather than conducting what I imagine are rather expensive studies. I'm not deluded into thinking that people will always ask for what's best for them (I have my own regular forays to the convenience store for Cheetos and ice cream to prove otherwise). It just seems rather disturbingly imperialist to go trotting around the world telling people that you've empirically proven what's best for them. "

Working longer isn't directly related to greater productivity. When bankers go on strike, nothing major happens; when municipal workers strike, all hell breaks lose (atleast in the US, in India we have a much higher tolerance to seeing garbage on our streets; case in point the repeated strike in Delhi which seem to yield minimal results because, well we've got other problems of municipal budgetary mismanagement here so let me just stop). Some of the ideas covered here. What I agreed with most though was the on point assessment that we are losing focus on long term innovation in favour of selling a new version of the same phone with minor refurbishments every year. Utopian thinking, according to Bregman, would give us a reality check as to what we should aim towards as a society rather than just being an exercise in aerial construction. He also points out that in order to get to these utopian targets (or atleast start moving in that direction) we need solid political leadership which is able to set its own agenda and respond to critique rather than just meekly trying to react to agenda that the conservatives are increasingly coming to define. Both of which are necessities to give new life to a world stuck in a rut.A solid book that goads you into thinking what kind of world you would like to live in in 20/30/50 years, given the possibilities of innovation that are at hand right now. The book asks you to reawaken your imagination (the wildest, most utopian kind which works without real world constraints to just stretch the idea of what may be radical and acceptable) and set the course for the future of humanity instead of simply being a sucker for the next, slightly upgraded versions of your current gadgets."

The author lays out a number of the main ideas you may have already heard being discussed in policy circles around universal basic income, ‘housing first’, shorter working weeks, measures beyond GDP of a country’s progress etc.From recommendations from friends, I’d expected the book to be fervently anti-capitalist. It isn’t. Instead the author argues that at a certain point capitalism needs to be reframed for the problems outlined in the book and puts forward a reasonable case (e.g. a basic income is highly efficient, jobs in healthcare have positive externalities that need to be recognised through payments). An interesting take, to be sure.The part that separated this book into being more enjoyable for me, was the comparison and references to history. How attitudes have changed (or in some cases haven’t) and why they do (or don’t). There is a chapter on how ideas change perceptions and can become the accepted norm in a society. Unfortunately, it is the shortest chapter in the book and I feel it is poorer for it –it would have been better to have a larger focus on this. However, the author does get some kudos for recognising their own potential cognitive biases in putting their case forward.A note on translation. The book was originally written in Dutch and translated by Elizabeth Manton. They have done a good job and I didn’t run into any issues in reading.If these areas of reform are new/unknown to you, I think you’ll enjoy the book a lot more. If you are already acquainted with them, then it’s fairly average.3.5 stars."

I’m convinced that the proposed solutions have merit but I’m not convinced the necessary cultural change is remotely possible. I completely agree that most people in highest paying jobs work very little and wouldn’t be missed if they quit showing up. I’ve seen the truth of fundamental inequality. The work we claim to value most isn’t the work that’s paid the most. How many times have we heard that “children are our future” and no job is more important than caring for our children. Yet look at how little we pay for daycare, how little we pay teachers. Pediatricians aren’t the highest paid medical professionals. Look at the wealthiest people in the world and ask yourself what do they do each day to make the world a better place? And is it their work that we reward so generously? Really? Or is it the work of an army of employees trying to stay afloat and provide for their families. An army of employees that take home only a tiny fraction of the wealth they create. Are the top 1% actually smarter, harder working, and more innovative than 3,500,000,000 other people put together?If any of the 36 richest people in the world never came in to work again, would anything be different for the billions struggling to survive?The one thing the rich and powerful people do better than the poor and powerless is skillfully rigging the system to strengthen their grip on wealth and power.

Are open borders really possible ? What impact will universal basic income have ? How should we measure GDP ? Do highly-paid ""knowledge economy"" jobs create wealth or shift wealth ?

It marshals plenty of historical evidence and contemporary statistics in support of its arguments, and what's more, it is a breezy, light-hearted, good-natured read. It's a great book to get you thinking about these topics, and why so many us have knee-jerk reactions that say these things could never happen.Bregman encourages us to understand that we have to develop an idea of a better world to work towards; that we are not stuck in a perpetual, unchanging present. If the Utopias of the past no are no longer useful, we must develop new ones. If we have no idea what a better society might look like, we sure as hell aren't likely to get there. Though the book makes use of many real-life examples, the approach to discussing these topics is somewhat abstract in the sense that there isn't much if any serious discussion of the main obstacles to implementing any progress toward Utopian goals that he describes. That's the book's main shortcoming and why I dock it a star. There are, of course, real material interests that benefit from the status quo, and they fight tenaciously to protect their privilege and wealth. Good luck making much progress toward a more equitable society without dismantling the institutions that support our current inequitable arrangements. But maybe that's a longer book and not that one that Bregman was setting out to write, which fair enough I guess. As it stands, this is still a fun, enjoyable read that engages with radical ideas in an accessible way. It would make a good gift for the budding lefty in your life who is still finding his or her footing."

Or spent the best years of their life duplicating existing pharmaceuticals in a way that's infinitesimally different enough to warrant a new patent application by a brainy lawyer so a brilliant PR department can launch a brand-new marketing campaign for the not-so-brand-new drug.A long time ago Friedrich Engels described the ""false consciousness"" to which the working class of his day - the ""proletariat"" - had fallen victim. According Engels, the nineteenth-century factory worker didn't rise up against the landed elite because his world view was clouded by religion and nationalism. Maybe society is stuck in a comparable rut today, except at the very top of the pyramid. Maybe some of those people at the top have their vision clouded by all the zeros on their paychecks, the hefty bonuses, and the cushy retirement plans. Maybe a fat billfold triggers a similar false consciousness: the conviction that you're producing something of value BECAUSE you earn so much."""

However, I did enjoy the book for its true purpose: a plea for the necessity of Utopian ideas. The author is well-aware that his proposed plans seem unrealistic to most people (although, mind you, they are really not). Even so, he manages to make you aware of the importance of wanting the world to be better than it is. His lust for new ideas, especially ‘unrealistic’ ones, is very infectious. I dare say, modern leftists could learn a thing or two from that. I intend on re-reading this book, to filter out the really good bits that have to to with that Dare-To-DDream type stuff. I recommend this book, but don’t go into this book expecting hardcore leftism. The fact that sometimes it misses the mark slightly does make it more enjoyable to read though, in my personal opinion at least, because it gives you something to engage with, rather than just saying “yes, exactly” to yourself for a couple hundred pages."

Bravo on the translation! The topic itself is timely and necessary. If we want to actually move into a more equitable world not driven by greed, unrelenting work, and downward-spiraling wages as we wait for machines (physical robots or computers) to take our jobs, then this is a good read. As always, utopias are difficult to imagine unless we start working towards them, and the author does make that point to try to get the reader over the hump of thinking his ideas are impossible. As he suggests, I would think we should try as a society some of these ideas in a modern context (like universal income trials like Ontario tried only to be axed by Doug Ford's government) to see if they work. One thing I really appreciated is the mythbusting the author undertakes to show that people (especially poor people) are not inherently lazy or undeserving of a living wage, even a guaranteed one for all, where we get to lift everyone out of poverty and help unbalance the inequities in a neo-liberal world."

In a different book about the dystopia we're currently living in and where it's headed, QualityLand, the AI running for president asks the question, ""For generations you have been told that you would only have to shovel coal for a while longer, then the train would take you to paradise. Have you ever considered that you have long since arrived in paradise but forgotten to get off?"" And this book asks this question a lot, too. Our productivity is so high that we could afford to be less productive in other areas, areas that matter. But we don't. Instead, we try to make healthcare and education ""more productive"", too. We could work fewer hours. But we don't. Instead, a lot of us work overtime in jobs that do not add anything at all to the good of society. We could devote ourselves to bettering our condition. But we don't. Instead, we have become ""caretakers of the museum of history"" and believe that bettering our condition is no longer possible. The author laments that our world has developed in such a way that broad societal improvement has become unthinkable. We have no utopias any more because we've shaped ourselves in such a way that we deny ourselves to think about them.

Bregman is arguing for three major changes in humanity: 1) Universal basic income, 2) The 15-hour work week, and 3) Open borders internationally. His arguments for basic income are the strongest. He cites many, many places where this has been tried and has proven successful. This section alone makes the book a nourishing meal for thought. The points he makes about open borders are also compelling. He argues that opening borders would be the fastest way to increase the well-being of people around the world, and his arguments -- while more philosophical than evidence-based -- are very, very convincing.The concept of the 15-hour work week is his weakest point, although I came away convinced, at least, that we can and should work a lot less. Again, his thought experiments are very persuasive. I wish every adult would read this and we could have a giant national and international conversation about how to implement Bregman's ideas!"

Kept thinking of this as a wonderful complimentary read to 'Winners Take All'.Rutger Bregman understands he's describing extremely radical ideas, but encourages readers to build the skill to embrace it. To have a vivid view of a glorious future, and not just be running away from a bad present. For some parts, he's almost a motivational speaker. As evident from his talks, he is strongly opinionated (which he admits in between) which can be an issue as he's quoted tons of experiments and stats, most of which can have heavy selection bias. It also goes to show how little solid scientific work is done in these fields. The book is definitely a strong thought-starter - hopeful of a future built with big, radical ideas."

It honestly does feel that Bregman is viewing at the whole thing from the perspective of a citizen of a developed nation. I can't fathom how any of those ideas can possibly be implemented in a country like India.Still, there are plenty of very fascinating ideas in the book. I think it will merit a second reading and a good deal of thought to understand applicability in different kinds of societies. The book also probes a fair amount of introspection of the cause of all the stress, and the inherent value of the ""work"" most of us do.

I was impressed that Bregman very calmly suggested that wealth inequality was at the heart of social problems (which set Carlson into a mindless rant). The book has the same quality of simplicity and common sense, backed by reference to multiple studies to prove his points. He points out that many of the solutions we think we've developed to social issues, like poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, etc, aren't working and we don't even realize it because we don't test our theories with data. We keep doing the same things that haven't worked the first, second or multiple times.

I was one of those Harvard grads that went into research: what does a good life look like?

The choice of the title of the book is certainly exaggerated and bombastic, as (necessarily) it does not offer an overall and complete recipe for solving among the biggest problems facing humanity, but rather reiterates the importance of taking (again) in consideration a series of solutions that today may seem radical but which, in the end, are nothing more than reasonable."

The book is concise and an enjoyable read with plenty of anecdotes to support his theories including cases in which UBI has worked in the past. He also disproves some of the time old arguments against changing the status quo. Most importantly though Utiopia for Realists tackles the issue with its own ideas. Namely that politicians dismiss them out of hand as being radical despite themselves enacting radical theories on the other end of the spectrum. Also that the very people who we need to be enacting these ideas or at least arguing for their efficacy aren't doing so in a verbose or meaningful way. The onus is in the reader who is convinced that these ideas could work to spread the word and organise.

For a set of policies that are not reactionary, or backward looking, but forward looking, hopeful and question who we all are and where we want to go together. It is a reminder that we are not buffeted on the winds of change, but rather the society we have is the result of our own actions; at any point in time we can choose something different.

That said, Bregman's writing is... well... dry. And I don't think his narration of the audiobook helps. Unlike sociological writers who adopt a narrative tone (I'm thinking Barbara Ehrenreich here), I think Bregman's approach is academic and thus dry.

Rampant inequality and global poverty should not be things that we readily accept. Bregman has a few ideas on how we can change this, and in this book, he shares how he believes universal basic income, open borders, and a shorter workweek could help bring us closer to a more utopian world.Near the end of the book, Bregman talks about how great change usually comes in times of crisis. Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, ideas like universal basic income, student debt forgiveness, rent control are now finding new and unexpected support.Time will tell if Bregman's utopia will come to pass, but I can only hope that the tide will start to shift as more of us become increasingly dissatisfied with the lackluster promises of our politicians."

He advocates a radical vision of open borders, among other things. Like any 'popular' book, in the process of dumbing down complex ideas one can often lose meaning, context, or fall victim of reductionism. For example, a cause of concern is the number of 'myths' Bregman 'debunks' with a short stroke of the pen. Immigrants don't force down wages, Bregman argues, citing one report to the effect. What does this mean, and how can we take this as truth: seperated research has said the opposite. Bregman also notes (p2) that in present day Netherlands a homeless person receiving public assistance has more to spend than the average Dutchman. True, no doubt, but meaningless if not contextualised and relativised against, say, the purchasing power of those two protagonists in their respective periods. These are just a few examples of a thread of ahistorical examples in Bregmans book.In fact, rather belatedly (p237) Bregman concedes that when reality clashes with our deepest convictions, rather than change them we recalibrate our worldview. Known as cognitive dissonance, on the same page Bregman admits that he too has discarded empirical evidence to suit his narrative. The cognitive dissonance accusation can be levelled at Bregman. A thought-provoking read, and definitely worth it, but take it with a pinch of salt.

According to economic calculations it would be cheaper to give homeless people a home for free than deal with the negative consequences and spillover effects, similarly just giving poor people money yields better results and brings less than anticipated negative effects than highly organized external foreign aid campaigns. I did not find the case for UBG that convincing, author keeps referring to the ""high-grade"" experiments in Finland but according to my latest knowledge the findings form there were not that convincing.

They've got no story to tell, nor even any language to convey it in. Fantastic book and an eye-opener for myself, one of many people disappointed with the state of social democracy and politics today. Clear, driven manifesto for basic income, a 15-hour work week and a revision of the relationship between labour, capital and people."

Introduced a lot of interesting ideas but remained fairly surfacial about them without ever fully engaging with counter arguments or diving deep into data. While some topics were thought provoking - namely, the idea of a utopia (or it's very existence as a thought) as a sign of the future and as an indicator of cultural relevance, others were just damn right arrogant for how casually they were spoken about without fully augmenting the counter narratives in the argument.

One of the ways agents of the establishment preserve the status quo is by making you feel ridiculous, wild, and stupid for thinking things could be different. They shame you into silence and acceptance. For most of us, it's really hard to mount a counter-offensive and show just how sensible an alternative could be. So we don't, and we sit there discontent, powerless, and embarrassed.Fortunately, Rutger Bregman actually studies these things and has the time to mount that counter-offensive. Utopia for Realists is just that: a counter-offensive against the proposition that the way things are is the only realistic way they could be.If you want to learn how to talk about building a world of less work (most of us aren't so fortunate as to work our dream jobs, so less work effectively means more time to do what we love), less poverty, and more migratory freedom, then this book is for you. And we all should learn how to talk about these things, because it sucks that the establishment has the upper hand just because it is incumbent, when there are better, saner, fairer ideas out there."

However, after diagnosing the problems that many recognize (we work too much, we spend money on the wrong things, and we don't treat people the way we say we should), he stops short of providing truly realistic cures for the disease.

It's optimistic – or perhaps just realistic. It reads like a dream – but a dream that you should take seriously, remembering that giving women the vote was once a preposterous idea. His vision of Utopia is based around a universal basic income, a 15 hour work week, and a world without borders – all big ideas to tackle in 264 pages. But they are passionately and persuasively argued for, as are his side campaigns to prove why the GDP is not an appropriate measurement of success in the modern day, and to highlight the ""bullshit"" of capitalism.

This book is a collection of some of the economist's insights into how to make sweeping societal progressions and thinking big. And I'll admit, some of it was amazing! He leads with his strongest argument for a Universal Basic Income, which is brilliant and should absolutely be done tomorrow. Sign me up. But then he loses me with some of his less convincing arguments, like for a shorter work week. When he argues for Open Borders, I was almost ready to write him off; but I think that might be a translating error, as he seems to be making the case for drastically increased migration rates. I'm 100% on board with that, but not ""Open Borders""; but the text was not originally written in English, so it's possible that the terms got mixed up somewhere."

234,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48859032-jamie-macdonald-jones,2,"BRILLIANT IDEAS MARRED BY POOR EVIDENCE AND CHEAP POLITICISINGIt’s difficult to give this book 2 stars, especially when the premises are something I really do agree with but there were far too many noticeable issues both with the writing and it’s content. Where to start...?Bregman presents three ideas - a shorter working week, a universal basic income and open borders. I understand the book is intend to be ‘popular’ and Bregman himself states “If you can’t explain your ideal to a fairly intelligent twelve-year old [...] it’s probably your own fault”. Sadly, Bregman stops at the level of a twelve-year-old and ultimately this book resembles a GCSE or A-Level style essay. THE EVIDENCE I found many assertions by the author where I’d look for a source to back it up to find Bregman had not bothered to give one, and of the sources in the Notes section at least half are quotations from novelists or opinion pieces in newspapers. He spends a lot of time talking about mechanisation and horses that sounds strikingly similar to a video on YouTube from a couple of years ago (Humans Need Not Apply) that explains the same stuff in two minutes and is common knowledge to most high school students. There’s some embarrassing lack of historical knowledge for a Historian as he implies that Luddism started in W Yorks rather than Nottinghamshire and his cobbled-together narrative of the Rawfolds Mill incident suggests he’d just looked it up in the book he sources moments before and assumes nobody will question it (I live and work about 5 minutes away from it). He crowbars in graph showing GDP from Worldmapper by Prof. Danny Dorling and co. and just leaves it there, not bothering to link this to his point within the chapter when it would have added depth and more importantly empirical evidence to what he was stating. He throws out statistics such as 47% of jobs likely to be lost to automation, not bothering to deconstruct what sectors of the economy these are in, for example, and the implications this has on his hypothesis. I understand that this book is meant to be a brief introduction and he’s a Historian not a Geographer or Economist but for someone espousing Enlightenment ideals the empirical evidence he really extrapolates from is scant in large parts (especially when you actually look at the sources and see sample sizes, method of measurement or statistical analysis).THE POLITICISATIONUnderstandable that Bregman has a political opinion and this is his book so he wants to put it across. However, others have noted that the final two chapters are less him advancing his three ideas as a cheap attack on the Left (he rightfully points out that they are often ineffective but lumps all the Left together as communistic, blue-sky thinkers) and doesn’t mention anything about the Right, even going so far as to imply that the Neoliberals are the emissaries of order, peace and all that is good - if only they listen to him! For me, presenting the powerful ideas he has requires some semblance of impartiality and would demand political concensus across the board if it is to be achieveable in the near future be he rather effectively rules this out. (I did wonder if some of his comments are meant to be the shake up the parties on the political Left need but then he descended into mud-slinging and I realised not.) I did have a good laugh a few paragraphs after Bregman decries “the underdog socialist” who only has an appeal to emotion left before he himself appeals to emotion with a weepy story of how he’s been told no by so many people but he still goes on and does what he’s doing because he believes passionately in the Utopian ideal. Do as I say and not as I do, reader.THE DELIVERYAside from the really awful adaptation of this book for the US market and the copy that I have which has a profile of the author under the banner “The Viral Sensation taking on the Billionaires”... Bregman seems to have a fixation on particular things throughout. He is fond of using idioms but not commonplace ones (he’s a non-native speaker, fair enough but the editor didn’t pick up on these?) He VERY liberally sprinkles in quotations from all and sundry (though Oscar Wilde pops up every seventh sentence seemingly) to give what I imagine he believes is a little flair to his writing. Sadly this has the opposite effect and crosses into pretention. And lastly he spends so little time examining ideas that just as you’re starting to engage with one he’s fluttering away to the next. OVERALLI went out of my way to order this book having heard of it and seen the reviews on Goodreads. It’s a shame that the potent arguments in this book were reduced to such basic points that they lost meaning and as someone who mostly agreed with the views before setting out I found myself questioning them. If I were someone who started out with opposing ideas I can certainly say that I would never have been swayed by Bregman. Perhaps this would have been much better with a different person delivering?"

It's just hard to think logically and analytically when part of your brain is so distracted by the thought of working only 15 hours a week and still getting benefits, all while the government gives you a few thousand dollars a year simply because it can afford it and we DO live in the richest country the world has ever seen. Honestly, that does sound like a pretty straight forward way of eliminating poverty, by simply raising EVERONE above the poverty line..... Hmmmmm.... I need to think about this some more......"

I did feel that the first few chapters were beating down the same points. Later chapters did vary more and were more interesting I felt and the last couple were extremely so considering what is going on in the world at the moment. Knowing that this was originally written in 2014 is strange as the events of the last 5 years would have a major impact on this book if it were written today. Overall it was not what I thought it was going to be but it was an interesting read. 
249,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3319481-dave,2,"Pretty quick read. At a high level, I felt that the book lacked data for the arguments it was making. It's not that I disagree with some of the points, but I was disappointed that the arguments lacked facts to back them up. One point I want to make clear is that I'm somewhat convinced about some of the main ideas behind the book, that universal basic income (for example) probably will need to happen at some point. I was just disappointed that this book is not the one I could recommend to people to convince the unconvinced.In contrast to a data filled book (""Why we sleep"" for example), where I might have my opinions confirmed or rejected based on surveys / data / studies, this book repeatedly stated what was clearly an opinion/interpretation of some unknown data, but then didn't follow up with backup facts. Or correlations were used to imply causality without bringing up the potential that this is not causal. And the fact that causality was probably not a word in the book at all indicates that this is a ""lecture"" book rather than an ""educate"" book.One thing which particularly annoyed me is the populist arguments where certain jobs / people were used as punch lines / jokes. ""Social media consultants"" bandied around across the book as a waste of time, a joke of a job, a bullshit job, etc etc. While you can make great soundbites out of making fun of the 1%, or social media consultants, or other jobs the ""masses"" might think aren't a great idea, it's not an educated viewpoint, and it's not something which brings us further along in the conversation.All together it felt like someone passionately (without data) arguing to a group of people who would already agree with them, and then that abstract argument feels convincing to said group of people who already agreed. Anyone not on the same page with the author will find the arguments unconvincing and unsupported."

255,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89624700-frank-lee,1,"When trying to come up with a Dystopia, the classical recipe is simple: think of a Utopia (or several, in Rutger's case) and ask yourself how you would achieve it.The book is full of sometimes infantile, often exaggerated claims, factoids given undue weight, ideological talking points, or false statements which, at times, are also doubled by self-righteous indignation. With the exception of a few arguments, the methodology employed by the author seems simple and straightforward: - start with an idea you like, and look for ""studies"" or articles that contain phrases that seem to support what you already believe in (a single anecdote in an article can later be used in your favor to convince readers unfamiliar with the topic or too busy to bother checking all the references you provide anyway); - quote those paragraphs while ignoring nuance or clarifications the original authors make (in their studies, articles, etc) that might indicate a more complex picture than the one you are after;- ignore acknowledgements (from the authors of the papers your quote) about the limitations of the research you quote;- ignore acknowledgements that additional studies are required before making more definitive statements;- present your Straw-man as ""what the actual Science shows"" Here are a few examples:""Some scientists even contend that the first person who will live to celebrate their 1,000th birthday has already been born.""Nope! No real scientist with expertise in a relevant field (e.g.: Biology) claims that. ""Science""-reporting journalists are not scientists. Speculators are not scientists either.""True, history is full of horrifying forms of utopianism – fascism, communism, Nazism – just as every religion has also spawned fanatical sects. But if one religious radical incites violence, should we automatically write off the whole religion? So why write off the utopianism?""The problem with this Straw-man is that, throughout history, we did not have ""one religious radical"" who has incited violence, but millions, at least (think of the Sunni/Shia schism; the Crusades; the expansion of Islam in Northern Africa, Iran, or Spain; the religious wars in Europe that followed the Protestant Reformation; the spread of Catholicism during the Spanish colonization of the Americas; the persecution of Hindus during Aurangzeb's rule; the Ottoman Empire; etc). Consider religious fanatics as part of the much wider pool of ideological fanaticism and the picture gets even more grim.""The US border effect on the wages of equal intrinsic productivity workers is greater than any form of wage discrimination (gender, race, or ethnicity) that has ever been measured ... It's apartheid on a global scale""This is classic wordplay wrapped in a rhetorical attempt at shaming the people living in developed countries for not conforming to the ideological fantasies and the self-righteousness of Mr. Bregman. ""Open borders promote immigrants’ return"" Here Bregman quotes from ""Understanding America’s Immigration Crisis"" by Douglas S. Massey. The paper, however, is specific to US and only over a relatively short time-window. Increase that time-window from a few years to 100 years and a radically different perspective emerges. Look at immigration to other developed regions of the world and the picture will get even more complex. What's worse is that Massey's paper discusses the alleged impact of various (more strict or more relaxed) immigration policies ... not what will happen should borders be open ... this is like someone discussing the impact of more strict or more relaxed financial regulations and a Bregman -like individual cherry-picking part of the argument to pretend to make the case for no financial regulations at all.""if you get people out of poverty, the average IQ goes up 3-5 points every 10 years""Most psychologists doubt such claims. Others question even the Scientific validity of IQ-tests (especially in the tails of the distributions).Immigration reform could be the key to world-wide equality.Complete nonsense. There's no evidence, no scientific study to support such a claim. What's even worse, no top-down solution to economic problems has ever worked in dynamic, large-scale, distributed and diverse environments."

We want serious change. Whether you talk about what's next after capitalism or how to turn back the clock to a time when the white male's supremacy was unquestioned, you're frustrated with the collective lack of imagination in Congress. Why do so many of the brightest minds at Google and Facebook engineers spend their days trying to get us to waste more time or click more ads? Why are bankers and lobbyists not considered by-and-large societal grifters?Anyway, I like Bregman's appreciation for evidence-based solutions. This is a hopefully, idealistic book, but it plants the seeds for realists. We _can_ build a better society. We just need the willpower, imagination, and courage to do it."
259,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97168196-damp-mop,1,"This book is written really well and sounds good in theory. Only it's written in a way that assumes every culture, person and class has everyone's best interests at heart.The open border policy is daft at best, assuming that you can open the borders to Europe without having it flooded by economic migrants from Africa and the middle East in a matter of days, ending all economic prosperity in Europe and the social fabric to go with it. If we want to improve the lives of people in these parts of the world, we should be exporting liberal values, the separation of church and state and a decent education. Not importing theocracy, totalitarianism and blatant homophobia.As for UBI, the idea of it is nice, the only question is, who foots the bill? It's not answered. He just rambles on about how bankers don't actually do anything, without really understanding, or if he does. Doing his best to ignore the way capital works, while ignoring the fact that the wealthy will leave as soon as the lower classes try to redistribute their money, leaving the middle class to be the ones purged by the working class for their money, just like every other time redistribution has been tried.Then he moves on to completely discredit his entire argument in the final chapter, by explaining confirmation bias and telling us how he ignored strong evidence suggesting he was wrong and only looked at the evidence that confirms his existing beliefs, followed by encouraging the readers to move the Overton window. Personally, I think the book is dumb and ignores human nature. Though he does briefly touch on psychology, in Cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias, he manages to display both traits throughout the book. I'd still suggest anyone with decent critical thinking skills read it if you want a better idea on the mentality of the cultural Marxists within western society today. Otherwise, he does use very strong rhetoric to make a good case to those who are easily influenced."

He sometimes makes it out that him and a few ""new"" economists were the first ones to think of this simple idea which has been argued for by the far left for a long time.

261,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1351359-lesley,4,"Simple recipe for fixing the world: give everyone money, rather than programs and social services; slash the work week to give people time for things that matter; and open all borders. Easy right?Before you ask, ""What is this guy smoking?"" give hm a listen. Bregman points out that by the standards of even a century ago, we've already achieved the means of utopia: plentiful year round food supplies; temperature controlled environments, simple cures for diseases which ravaged our ancestors. Of course these benefits have not spread equally across the world, and even in wealthy countries we have plenty of stuff but are working ourselves crazy.Bregman's heavily researched yet accessible argument is that we waste enormous amounts of resources on social service programs, border security and ""bullshit jobs"" which merely move money around but don't create wealth or solve important problems. He further notes that most of our objections to his utopian schemes are based on prejudice and preconceptions but little actual evidence. Doesn't giving poor people money for nothing or a shorter work week mean they'll sit around drinking all day? Nope; several experiments on the Universal Basic Income (UBI) have shown just the opposite. Won't poor people make stupid purchases like drugs and unhealthy food with the money if they aren't regulated? Again no: UBI recipients in various countries and social systems tended to make strategic investments in equipment and transportation and housing. Won't open borders depress wages and lead to mass unemployment and crime? Again wrong: immigration has no net effect on wages, and can actually increase jobs since immigrants are also consumers. (Fun fact: increased policing of the U.S./Mexico border has led to MORE undocumented immigrants living permanently in the Us...because going back and forth to Mexico is so difficult.)Bregman comes down hard on the nonprofit, foreign aid and development industries, (""Why send over expensive white folks in SUVs when we can simply hand over their salaries to the poor?"" p. 31) noting there is zero evidence that such aid actually accomplishes anything. He is also a harsh critic of the ""underdog socialists"" who react emotionally to injustice but are incapable of articulating any exciting new ideas. ""And, too often, it seems as if those on the left actually like losing. As if all the failure, the doom, and the atrocities manly serve to prove they were right all along...Sadly the underdog socialist has forgotten that the story of the left ought to be a narrative of hope and progress. The greatest sin of the academic left is that it has become fundamentally aristocratic, writing in bizarre jargon that makes simple matters dazzlingly complex...What we need is a narrative that speaks to millions of ordinary people"". ( p 258)There are some obvious flaws with Bregman's prescription: if everyone is getting a certain income and thus has more purchasing power it seems likely that prices would rise accordingly. And, as the proponents for Universal Basic Services point out, without a strong communal network for health care, education, sanitation etc. a private income will only go so far. There's also the simple factor of greed: the current system works pretty well for a small entrenched group of powerful people, and it won't be easy to convince them to release their grip, (Bregman recommends high taxation of financial transfers to encourage smart people to go into education, science and research rather than hedge funds).But like I said, give him a listen. There are young, progressive Congressional leaders: (Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, Underwood) who are speaking his language. It's time for cranky underdog socialists like myself to give them space."

263,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82208787-liam-semple,3,"I wish I'd been able to read this in 2014 when it was first published in Dutch. It's well worth reading, but I'm reviewing Utopia for Realists in 2020, which is lightyears from 2014 ideologically. Rutger Bregman's book is a three-headed defense of ""utopian"" policies, covering universal basic income, a 15-hour-workweek, and open borders. In 2014 these were radical ideas. In 2020 they're on the table. Note that I already broadly agreed that these three ideas were good ones before I read Utopia for Realists, so I can't say how well Rutger's arguments hold up against a total non-believer, but I think it would be hard to mount an evidence-based opposition. Rutger employs a blend of instructional historical examples and hard economic data to back up his claims that 1) these policies are possible and 2) these policies would be good economically and socially/morally. Utopia for Realists is short, but I must admit its steady rhythm of ""Here's a societal problem, here's a story about how it got fixed, here's the utopian policy, here's some data and another example to prove it's not utopian,"" got repetitive by the end. The writing is very accessible (which is a big positive for a popular history/economics book) but also somewhat bland. This book was originally released in Dutch, but since Bregman is fluent in English I'm not sure if he/the publisher simply translated it or rewrote it. Still, I think the accessibility is more of an asset than a detriment. The utility of this book is high, because it lays out the case for important but radical-seeming policies in terms and arguments anyone can understand and get behind. You might think the policy focus means Utopia for Realists will soon age to the point of not being worth reading, but the real takeaway (and the reason I think this book will be considered a classic of popular politics/economics) is not the specific ""utopian"" policies, but Rutger's way of seeing them. In the book's final chapter, Rutger spends some time discussing Milton Friedman in a positive light. I've been fascinated by Milton ever since I first read about him and Rutger finally illuminated why. At a time when social democracy was the standard economic model, Milton Friedman was able to convince an entire generation of economists that greed is actually good and that society will be better if we let the greedy be as greedy as they like. In 1960 this was a radical fringe idea, but by 1980 it had become the bedrock of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. Even for those of us who detest Milton's ideas, his progression from fringe thinker to foundational thinker is instructive. If the neoclassical economists could do it, so can today's social democrats, and even those further left than that. The past six years have only proven Rutger's point. (Rutger wrote a very good piece for The Correspondent about what he sees as the coming collapse of neoliberalism that illustrates this.)Since reading Utopia for Realists, I've become a fan of Rutger's writings for The Correspondent, and there he has demonstrated that he's become a more concise and effective communicator of neokeynesian economic policies. That's why I'm looking forward to his next book, Humankind. I like Utopia for Realists, but I think his new book will be an improvement in every way with an even more ambitious message."

GIST
At the end of the book, Brugman asserts that the best way to cut off the status quo is to present the most radical ideas in the most abrupt way possible. He succeeded doing that in this book, and I cannot stress how much it implored me to be more idealistic, not because for fanatical reasons, but for the sake of knowing that things can always be better. In this book, he proposes three main things: 1) basic universal income, 2) shorter workweeks, and 3) open borders for all.Key points- In Utopia for Realists, Brugman discusses some ideas that can change the way the present world operates. By reflecting on the need to have a utopia as a compass for progress, he presents radical ideas that not are backed by numbers themselves.- The first proposition of the books is the call for a universal basic income. Brugman cites numerous studies to support the benefits of providing free money to everyone. I repeat, everyone. Studies in Canada, UK, and even in developing nations have shown that the poor do not need much help, just cash.- Having money greatly reduces the mental bandwidth of the poor, allowing them to focus more on school and provide more time for their families. Brugman also debunks the common assertion that providing free money would make people lazy, however this is far from the case. With baseline money provided, it allows people to dig deeper into their own passions and to not get stuck into bullshit jobs (to be discussed later). By providing cash (no catches or requirements), poverty can be curtailed by 1) providing enough money for all basic needs and 2) allowing these individuals to reduce their mental bandwidth, preventing them from making stupid decisions that leads them deeper into the rabbit hole of poverty. In effect, providing free money levels the playing field for everyone.- Bregman argues that the figures to define the progress of an era must adopt to the needs of that era, in particular. In fact, using GDP as the yardstick for progress nowadays greatly limits the ability of policymakers to check for the progress on things that usually matter. GDP was borne of the need for a figure that represents the total production of the country in a given time span, and this was greatly beneficial during war as shipments of artilleries, ammunitions, tanks, cars, can easily account for the needs of the time—to produce more stuff to use for the war.- However, in our new age wherein world wars went into hiding, there is no incentive to detect progress purely from a production standpoint. Numerous new yardsticks were invented through the years, ranging from calculating happiness (Happiness index) to human development indices. In the end, what our generation needs is a generally agreed upon yardstick for progress that not only accounts for consumption but the overall well-being of the citizenry itself.- One of the bizarre propositions is the 15-hour workweek. In fact, Brugman argues that it inevitably leads to this. What's the point of the endless attempts for optimization in production, cutting employees and using more machines if humanity cannot have an increase in leisure. In fact, contrary to the ongoing hustle culture, typical people need good rest to become productive employees. However, since the feminist movement in the late 20th century, the average workweek of an American family skyrocketed as women entered the workforce. This is not necessarily bad per se in the context of the fight for the equality of both sexes but it also presents the backwardness of the system as supposed improvements in systems and machinery through the years have yet reduced the toil of the workforce. Having shorter workweeks should not be tied to the notions of stagnation but instead to the intrinsic needs of humans—relationships, family, and leisure.- In Chapter 7, Rutger Bregman gives a major middle finger to the finance sector as it continues to cash in on the capitalist system while actually producing nothing. In fact, if you'd compare the effects of garbage men striking to bankers striking, the effects are bewildering. When garbage men struck in New York in 1968, the city almost went into total chaos due to filth. When bankers struck in Ireland, barely nothing happened.- The truth is that humanity has been looking down on service jobs that actually provide real value while it glorifies jobs that actually just shift the location of cash in the market ladder (bankers). This is not to undermine the unarguable skill and intelligence of these bankers, yet it must also be remembered that doing something difficult and specialized does not necessarily make it useful. Furthermore, with the obvious obsession for more work, companies have created more bullshit jobs, jobs that actually create any tangible value to the world—leading to a workforce that feels hollow in its core. And this is further exacerbated by the income gap between notable service jobs—jobs whose absence can make society go berserk such as healthcare and education. Yet, the salaries of these people seem like change money to the bonuses handed out to people at Wall Street.- This new market that caters to shifters has lead to a shift in careers that focus on creating new ideas and value (scientists, innovators, and thinkers) to jobs that only shift value such as banking, corporate law, lobbying, high-frequency trading, and more. These people are getting paid just to track the market and shift preexisting wealth that is actually generated by people who focused more on creating value. How ironic. The disappointing truth is that the education system further exacerbates this by buzz words such as 21st century skills, problem-solving techniques, and more. It had become so obsessed on grooming students to fit the job market that it failed to answer if that job market provides any tangible value anyways.- Robots are here, and yes, it seems that some jobs are at their mercy. In fact, compared to previous corporations in the 60s that employed up to hundreds of thousands of people, the biggest corporations nowadays produce more but only employ half. Robots are here to stay. This automation creates the dystopian possibility that someday—humans may be demoted to creatures who just push the buttons of these robots so that they'd start doing work. As these robots eat up a huge portion of these bullshit jobs, it would be better for us to concern ourselves to not make our jobs our identity through a universal basic income and shorter workweek.- Lastly, Bregman calls for a solution to global poverty through open borders. Instead of pouring in cash through cash aids for developing nations, why not open the borders instead? We live in a society wherein your standard of living is not predetermined by talent or social class but to the country you are born in. In fact, people at the poverty line in the US enjoy far more compared to the poorest people in developing countries. The existence of borders has lead to a segregation of the standard of living of people throughout the globe, preventing the supposed goal of allowing everyone to share the fruits of prosperity.- Numerous fallacies were debunked by Bregman as to why people prefer to have borders instead. 1) terrorism, 2) criminal rates, 3) undermining social cohesion, 4) job competition, 5) decreasing wages due to immigrant labor, 6) immigrants are lazy, 7) immigrants will never go back to their home nations. However, all of these fallacious arguments are debunked. By opening borders, developing countries can rake in more cash that can be used to also curtail poverty for their citizenry. The pay gap between two workers with the same experience and skillset in two countries is jarring.
Conclusion
Lastly, if there is any takeaway from this book, it's that ideas change the world. During times of crisis where the status quo is challenged, it is the existence of alternative ideas, new ideas that can lay the groundwork for the new normal. By having a utopia in mind, humanity need not look further on where it is headed as current systems succumb. In fact, the lack of change after the 2008 collapse of the finance sector can be due to the lack of ideas presented during the time. Radical ideas come in handy in times of crisis.Great book! Reading these types of books gives me a breathe of fresh air from all the technical reactions shown in science textbooks.5/5!"

266,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632701-sarah,5,"This is a fascinating look at our current society, especially pertaining to our work/life balance. Rutger Bregman is a political historian and author, and his book was originally published in Europe, where it won literary acclaim. Years ago, many people predicted that with the advent of technology, humans would not have to work so hard, and machines would do the majority of the work. This would enable us to have much more leisure time. In fact, the opposite may have happened. Many more occupations have been created, including many jobs which are superfluous, and don’t contribute to the betterment of society. Numerous studies have proven that the less people work, the more productive their output. Overworked people don’t create any more, and tend to clog up creativity and ingenuity. Bregman includes a very interesting history on GDP, how it’s determined, what it measures, and what it leaves out. By relying on these statistics to gain insight on how our country is actually performing, can be misleading and inaccurate.I found Bregman’s argument for basic income exceptionally compelling. He defends that poor’s people number one issue is that they don’t have enough money, and by merely supplying them with adequate funds, a myriad of other issues simply disappear. When you consider the economic strain of the welfare state, and all the costs associated with dispensing the assistance, and all of the oversight, it’s actually more economically feasible to dole out cash, no strings attached. There have been numerous studies which have had much higher success rates. Fears about people squandering cash, or not managing the money well, are pretty much unfounded. People are so used to the welfare state, that it seems easier to continue the status quo. Included are lots of interesting studies, including some hosted by our own government, including Nixon’s administration. Bregman also argues that closed borders are one of the biggest discriminatory factors in our current world. Where you are born, not only dictate where you live, but where you can work and travel to and from. Your economic destiny is predetermined not by how hard you work, but by the economic conditions of your country, and its relationship to the rest of the world. This section has an interesting premise, but I felt it could be fleshed out more in another volume. This book poses a lot of questions about our current state of doing things, and if it’s really achieving the goals we set out to reach. Bregman argues there must be a better way of streamlining economic stimulus, making sure citizens are taken of, and making all of our lives more leisurely and enjoyable. I really found this book to be compelling and easily digestible. A modern day Thomas More for critical thinkers. "

OSCAR WILDE (1854–1900)==========﻿These days, there are more people suffering from obesity worldwide than from hunger.5 In Western Europe, the murder rate is 40 times lower, on average, than what it was in the Middle Ages, and if you have the right passport, you’re assured an impressive social safety net.6 Maybe that’s also our biggest problem: Today, the old medieval dream of the utopia is running on empty.==========Africa, too, is fast shedding its reputation for economic devastation; the continent is now home to six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies.==========﻿~ ufff, drito u sržWelcome, in other words, to the Land of Plenty. To the good life. To Cockaigne, where almost everyone is rich, safe, and healthy. Where there’s only one thing we lack: a reason to get out of bed in the morning.Notching up our purchasing power another percentage point, or shaving a couple off our carbon emissions; perhaps a new gadget – that’s about the extent of our vision. We live in an era of wealth and overabundance, but how bleak it is.==========﻿There’s no new dream to replace it because we can’t imagine a better world than the one we’ve got.==========﻿We see it in academia, where everybody is too busy writing to read, too busy publishing to debate. In fact, the 21st-century university resembles nothing so much as a factory, as do our hospitals, schools, and TV networks. What counts is achieving targets. Whether it’s the growth of the economy, audience shares, publications – slowly but surely, quality is being replaced by quantity.==========Meanwhile, the welfare state has increasingly shifted its focus from the causes of our discontent to the symptoms.Time and again, we blame collective problems like unemployment, dissatisfaction, and depression on the individual. If success is a choice, then so is failure. Lost your job? You should have worked harder. Sick? You must not be leading a healthy lifestyle. Unhappy? Take a pill.==========It is capitalism that opened the gates to the Land of Plenty, but capitalism alone cannot sustain it.==========﻿We have to do what great thinkers like John Stuart Mill, Bertrand Russell, and John Maynard Keynes were already advocating 100 years ago: to “value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful.”==========~ The book is definitely written from the perspective of a highly developed western country, as some of the features of Utopia which the author identifies are already not present in countries just a little East, such as Croatia. But the author is aware f that as pointed out here:This is a book for everyone living in the Land of Plenty. For everyone with a roof over their head, a reasonable salary, and the opportunity to make the most of life.==========﻿~ the message is don't be afraid to dream big when dreaming up a new worldWithout all those wide-eyed dreamers down through the ages, we would all still be poor, hungry, dirty, afraid, stupid, sick, and ugly.==========~ 15 hour work week chapter:To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization. BERTRAND RUSSELL (1872–1970)==========﻿A dyed-in-the-wool capitalist and the mastermind behind the production line, Henry Ford had discovered that a shorter workweek actually increased productivity among his employees.==========﻿“Leisure, thought by many to be the epitome of paradise, may well become the most perplexing problem of the future.”==========﻿In the U.S., working mothers actually spend more time with their kids today than stay-at-home moms did in the 1970s.==========﻿Research suggests that someone who is constantly drawing on their creative abilities can, on average, be productive for no more than six hours a day.36 It’s no coincidence that the world’s wealthy countries, those with a large creative class and highly educated populations, have also shaved the most time off their workweeks.==========The central issue is achieving a more equitable distribution of work. Not until men do their fair share of cooking, cleaning, and other domestic labor will women be free to fully participate in the broader economy. In other words, the emancipation of women is a men’s issue.==========﻿Work is now often perceived as a kind of hobby, or even as the very crux of our identity.==========﻿Not coincidentally, the countries with the shortest workweeks also have the largest number of volunteers and the most social capital.==========﻿Michael Faye, founder of Give Directly, the organization behind Bernard’s windfall. “And the truth is, I don’t think I have a very good sense of what the poor need.”7 Faye doesn’t give people fish, or even teach them to fish. He gives them cash, in the conviction that the real experts on what poor people need are the poor people themselves.==========~ stab at volunteer programs and charity organizations in the developing worldThe great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need.==========﻿~ love this haha ""the capitalist road to communism""And Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) promises that, one day, it will come. A universal basic guaranteed income. And not merely for a few years, or in developing countries alone, or only for the poor, but just what it says on the box: free money for everyone. Not as a favor, but as but as a right. Call it the “capitalist road to communism.”==========﻿~ More leisure time in the fight against climate change - a social circular economy with no waste of productivity - coolClimate change? A worldwide shift to a shorter workweek could cut the CO2 emitted this century by half.39 Countries with a shorter workweek have a smaller ecological footprint.40 Consuming less starts with working less – or, better yet – with consuming our prosperity in the form of leisure.==========﻿Pundits were even going around quoting Victor Hugo – “Nothing is stronger than an idea whose time has come.”==========Not so very long ago, democracy still seemed a glorious utopia. Many a great mind, from the philosopher Plato (427–347 B.C.) to the statesman Edmund Burke (1729–1779), warned that democracy was futile (the masses were too foolish to handle it), dangerous (majority rule would be akin to playing with fire), and perverse (the “general interest” would soon be corrupted by the interests of some crafty general or other).==========﻿We may be living in the age of individualism, but our societies have never been more dependent on one another.==========To quote a joke popular among economists: “The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.”==========﻿People who owned capital (stocks, houses, machines) enjoyed a much higher standard of living than folks who merely worked hard. For hundreds of years the return on capital was 4–5%, while annual economic growth lagged behind at under 2%.=========="

Utopia for Realists? More like Utopia for Optimists on Crack! Especially since, and I'm not kidding here, the author basically encourages the reader to be unrealistic in the very last paragraph! 🙄So first, a bit of context: I'm fairly on the ""Left"" to begin with, and am certainly open to the idea of UBI or a shorter work week. I'm in any case convinced that our growth, consumerism and work-obsessed neoliberal über-capitalist society needs a major overhaul if we want to ensure fairness, happiness, and oh, yeah, the freaking survival of our species on this planet in decently pleasant circumstances (the dire, existential threat of massive environmental destruction is, mostly, conveniently ignored by our author, which just baffled me). I'm even one of those who thinks perpetual economic growth needs to be questioned, and even dropped to a certain extent. The author does mention that a wee bit, but doesn't spend enough time on it, in my opinion... Largely because, and this was incredibly weird to me: despite proponing pretty ""left-wing"" ideas, he regularly, throughout the book, went out of his way to praise Capitalism, and neoliberalism. The lack of self-awareness and the amount of cognitive dissonance displayed by this guy was staggering. Truly staggering. I'm not saying he had to trash the concept of capitalism, not at all, but why was he so desperate to prop it up when it's so painfully obvious capitalism, or at least its excesses, is responsible for most of the societal ills he mentions in his book?! Like, what the hell was up with that? I'll also add that, while I'm by no means an economist, neither is he, clearly. I'll just go through some of the things that irked me: - Starts the book off with a Hobbesian narrative: the world was hell for everyone (or almost everyone, but the nuance here doesn't matter) before now. All our ancestors were stupider, more miserable, poorer, uglier (really?) than we are today. Oh fuckin' hell. I don't buy that. History is not a linear narrative (except, perhaps, technology-wise, and even that's actually debatable when you look at Antiquity vs. the Dark Ages), and you'd think that, as a supposed Historian, he'd know that. I'm not one of those people who thinks everything was better before either, by the way. Not at all. I think both statements are false. Some things were better at certain times than they are now. Other things, hell most other things, were worse, but not consistently worse either. It largely depends on time and place. And that's just for written History too. How the hell can you even compare the well-being/happiness of a 150000 year-old hunter-gatherer human to a modern one? It's a question that's literally impossible to answer, so I just cannot take an author who makes such black and white statements about the past and present that seriously. - Shoddy bibliography. Now, when you make grand claims about pretty complicated topics, I expect solid citations. Not, like, 50% of them coming from newspaper articles, opinion pieces or your own previous writing! Add to that the consistent lack of contextualisation; in so many instances it was ridiculous. I was like: ""yes, but what does this actually mean in the context of your subject?"" or ""how can you even compare these things?"" ""How do you even define this, to make this statement/comparison?"" And on and on it went. - The endless contradictions. Now, one or two I can understand: sometimes you don't know how to express nuance well, and it comes off as sounding like you're agreeing with two opposing statements. I get that, it happens to me too. But it just would not stop in this book. The author would say x on one page, then three pages letter would say the exact freaking opposite. Sometimes he'd even contradict statements supported by a citation, which was quite frankly hilarious (if not embarrassing). It would cross chapters too, undermining some of his arguments (this was especially relavant regarding his one chapter on open borders, which was by far the weakest of the three in my opinion, but then again I have more reservations about that idea, so I acknowledge bias might be at play). - The vagueness of some of his ideas, and the ultimate lack of direction in how to even apply them. Which is another reason why I find the title of the book to be misleading. This book is not a how to! It's, at best, a superficial introduction to the concepts of UBI, work-society restructuration and lighter borders/border abolition. I mean, sure, he introduces a couple of experiments that are being done, or more often, have been done in the past... and that's it. So, if it serves as a spark of inspiration for someone, cool I guess, but I was expecting something a bit more concrete and substantial. - The abysmal lack of awareness, or I guess just plain denial of the interconnectedness between capitalism (or at least, once again, capitalism in its current excessive/toxic form), sexism/misogyny (Patriarchy for short), racism/xenophobia (Colonialism for short) and, of course, environmental destruction on a massive scale...Oh, but wait, right, that doesn't really matter because we live in the Land of Plenty and all we need is just a few new ideas to push us forward because otherwise we stagnate in societal boredom, I guess? But at the same time, society has never been more unequal, and we're in the shit (only on a socio-economic level, mind you). 🙄 That's what I meant when I mentioned the constant contradicting going on in the book. I'll also add that he does, and I really hate myself for even putting it this way, sound like a smug, arrogant ""white guy"" at times. With overall good intentions, mind you. And that chapter on ""open borders"" I mentioned? Yeah, a shit-show. Epitomized every bit of criticism I just mentioned. With a good dollop of bad faith too. Applying statistics from one country to every other country (which, just, does not work, for so many reasons), using arguments he'd basically demolished in a previous chapter on automation and ""robots are going to replace most jobs"", ignoring a couple of elephants in the room (religion, and the threat to secular society or women's rights, for example), etc... Not to mention a lot of countries already have borders that aren't closed? So, is he actually advocating for abolishing borders entirely, or just asking countries not to close the borders they have? That wasn't clear at all. Personally, I'm more sympathetic to having regulated immigration than no immigration or unregulated immigration, so I guess I'm in favour of open borders? If that's what he actually meant?? Same with UBI. I'm in favour of the idea, but not if it means scrapping every other socialized system in place, such as universal healthcare. His position on that wasn't clear at all. He seemed in favour of scrapping a lot of elements of the ""nanny"" state, which I don't necessarily disagree with, but you can't just scrap everything either. UBI on its own, in the aggressive capitalist system we currently live in, wouldn't help much, as other commenters who agree with the concept, but not the way it's presented in this book, have pointed out. If this book can't appeal to someone who more or less agrees with its core premises, then there's no way in hell it will convince anyone who wasn't open to those ideas in the first place. I would not recommend this book to anyone honestly. But I'm open to better suggestions on those same subjects."

It is this self-defeating cynicism that the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman sets out to counteract in “Utopia for Realists: How we can build the Ideal World”. As fewer and fewer people believe a fairer, more just world can be created, and where we seem to have constructed societies “where optimism and pessimism have become synonymous with consumer confidence or the lack thereof”, “Utopia for Realists” is a commendable (if flawed) attempt to show another world is possible.Bregman spends much of this readable – although ultimately slight – volume sketching out the policy ideas that might comprise a new utopia. He argues against the predominance of GDP and GNP in economic theory and argues for the eradication of “bullshit jobs”. Having established how economic productivity and long hours do *not* go hand-in-hand with each other, he makes a passionate case for a shorter working week, viewing it as an antidote to everything from workplace stress and burnout, climate change, unemployment and family breakdown, through to declining levels of volunteering and involvement in civil society. He advocates higher taxes for higher earners, specifically as a way of moving citizens away from employment in the financial sector and as a method of getting “more people to do work that is useful”. Neither is Bregman afraid to propose policies that may appear unpopular in our current political climate; “Utopia for Realists” contains spirited defences of immigration and “a world without borders” as routes to economic fairness and poverty alleviation. As optimistic and upbeat as Rutger Bregman might be, the problem with “Utopia for Realists” is that it outlines a utopian vision without telling us how it might be turned into reality. Rutger Bregman is great at outlining why something like Universal Basic Income or giving free money to poor people are excellent ideas for society, but incredibly vague as to how you might get citizens to vote for them or pay for them. Similarly, ‘Open Borders’ is undoubtedly an ennobling concept but, as far-right populism seemingly sweeps the globe, how the hell do you get western electorates to sign up to it? It is not enough merely to describe what the promised land will look like; you also need to be able to build a bridge that people can cross to it."
271,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13721061-richard-bromhall,4,"It is unsurprising that Rutger's book, Utopia for Realists, has had such worldwide acclaim. It's clear, casual style makes it accessible to almost any reading level, and it's explanation of complex economic ideas through anecdote makes for an engaging and relatable read. It is what any thinker, who seeks to transform the world, should attempt to do. Long, rambling, inaccessible texts appear, which posture and serve only to convey the intellect of the author, are all too ubiquitous in the field of economics, philosophy, sociology, cultural studies, and beyond. Rutger's text, however, is a serious attempt to introduce ordinary people to transformative ideas. In this sense, it is a truly brilliant work.Because of this, and the avalanche of statistics that feature, Utopia for Realists is persuasive. The explanation of the 15-hour workweek and the universal basic income is successful in so far that it debunks all the criticisms of progressive economic ideas from the past, anticipating the critiques of ideologues who will no doubt hate the notion of a reduction in official working hours for the majority. The text draws on studies completed across the developed and developing worlds, and, Rutger shows, has positive outcomes. Autonomy of individuals - when money does not restrict them - creates wealth and prosperity, whether the universal basic income is implemented in North America, Europe, or Africa.What is less persuasive is the chapter on open borders. I struggled to find what it was precise that meant open borders were a good idea. Again, the anticipated criticisms were debunked, but the emphasis on why it would prove successful seemed to be glanced over. That it was relegated to the penultimate chapter of the book, when there was more than enough space in the middle section, seems to acknowledge this failing. More elaboration on this section would be useful if it is to convince the right-wing narratives that dominate debate in the UK and USA.Yet, the text itself, though some chapters seem superfluous, is excellent. It offers a real alternative that few other commentators - the 'armchair philosophers' Rutger calls them - have yet to provide. This is required reading for anyone who has had enough of the dreadful economic system of neoliberalism. It's not just for politicians or commentators to consume; it's a book for everyone, the dreamers who hope for a better world. Buy or steal a copy now."

273,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39472181-timothy-dymond,4,"The 'last chapter problem' afflicts all books that offer political and social analysis along with profound policy recommendations. Having outlined carefully what is wrong and what would fix it, the writer has little left to offer on how to actually implement these brilliant ideas. A common fallback is to invoke the need for 'political will' - which is always a euphemism for 'I have no idea how to do this'. Rutger Bregman almost gets around this in his epilogue by making a virtue out of 'impossiblism': the 1968 slogan 'be realistic, demand the impossible' is the actual political strategy. Bregman's policy goals (e.g. universal basic income; fifteen hour work week; tax capital not labour) are, in his view, on the right side of achievable, while offering a tantalizing and exciting social transformation. Bregman criticizes those he calls 'underdog socialists' on the Left - whose goal in life appears to be to deaden everyone else's expectations, and bore people to political death. Bregman makes convincing cases for the viability of all his proposals, using historical references and wonkish studies. My favorite section was his defense of the 'Speenhamland' system, a late 18th, early 19th century British attempt to set up a basic income system of family payments. Both Right and Left have derided Speenhamland as a failure, however Bregman argues that it was actually a great success, and it was brought down by false information and slander.Unlike a lot of 'policy wonk' writers, Bregman appreciates that how you get somewhere (i.e. by mass political activism) is as important as where you are going. Thus he argues for a radical politics that excites people - which makes a virtue out of 'impossible' goals. Bregman is an easy read, and it's easy to feel convinced by this book. Where do you go afterwards? Well you got to dream! "
274,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,1,"This book is not a Utopia for realists - it's a Utopia for daydreamers. None of the claims for UBI show financial feasibility. Most people would agree that giving money to the poor would help alleviate poverty - so that's not the question here. The real question is how would we go about executing it? Even with Elizabeth Warren's 2% wealth tax on the rich (which was considered extreme), she didn't have the budget to do half of the progressive agenda she wanted to do. Andrew Yang's UBI proposal was equal parts absurd and hilarious - he said to give Americans a bare minimum UBI he would only need a 10% VAT tax and a higher capital gains tax. Independent analysts claimed that even if Yang increased the VAT to 20% he would still be 25% short of his goal. How can a book about UBI completely overlook this? Where is the analysis that shows UBI is financially feasible? Here are a few other things that I noticed about the book that were completely off the mark.1.) He thinks that machine learning and robots are going to take all of the human jobs. This is a populist idea that's been around since the steam engine. This is how I feel about it: 	• The transition from labor-intensive jobs to knowledge-intensive jobs will continue to happen. And a lot of people will lose their current jobs - but there won't be a shortage of jobs. Those who refuse to change with the times will suffer, those who adapt will survive. There will always be work for humans because robots (however sophisticated we make them) will never truly understand human nature and what we need.	•  Contrary to popular opinion - this is a good thing. Labor-intensive jobs tend to be ""slave-jobs"" while jobs that require knowledge tend to promote psychological safety and individual liberties.	• Nowhere in the book does he have a critical analysis of jobs created due to technology vs. jobs lost due to technology. The reason is simple: he will have to admit to the fact that we are actually doing better jobs, and regardless of pockets of industries that have become obsolete, overall the number of occupations have increased.  2.) He argues that Education is not really a poverty trap - the real poverty trap according to him is ""scarcity"". He cites one review paper that concludes that financial literacy only explains 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors to back this up - which I think is ridiculous.	• If you really want to read about poverty traps I recommend Abhijit Banerjee's ""Poor Economics"". In it, he shows that food scarcity is actually no longer a poverty trap in most of the world. Abhijeet also shows that education is really the biggest poverty trap there is - and we don't pay enough attention to it. Or at least think it's too much of a risk to invest that much of a long time in school.  Other poverty traps that we really need to focus on include health, city infrastructure and functional local governance (courts, banks, insurance etc).	 3.) Social mobility - he gets this wrong too. He says that there's no country on Earth where the American Dream is less likely to come try than in the US.	• Not true - America is not a monolith. The social mobility in US cities is equivalent to/or higher than European cities. The social mobility in rural areas are lower than European rural areas -  but not worse than developing countries.	 4.) ""Bullshit jobs"" and education - I don't even know where to start with this one. If public relations, human resources, and administrative jobs are ""bullshit"" - the only thing that is lacking is an organizational vision and leadership.	• He also thinks that by restructuring education, the job market will tag along. In a maybe tongue-in-the-cheek comment, he says we should teach budding Economists morals and philosophy. At this point, I really wanted to put down the book, but I read on.	• Everybody and their uncle have an opinion about Education and how it should change. I'm not against listening to any of these ideas: but the reality is there isn't going to be a solution that helps everyone. You can't lift the demand for artists, philosophers, historians (as he believes) from thin air. He seems to be wanting to use education for his own agenda - which is the one thing we should be worried about Education reform. 5.) The rant about GDP.  - I feel like he's just building a straw man here to beat up. We all know that GDP is a crude measure of production. No sane economist these days would use it as an absolute measure of growth. Instead it's only used to provide context and most people are careful to point out the caveats. 6.) Handing out money is better than microfinance? He comes to this conclusion in a very strange and delusional way.	•  First, he cites a study done by Esther Dufflo who he believes to say that microfinance doesn't help the poor. This is not true - that study says that business profits only increase for the 90th percentile of the people who get for-profit microfinance loans. But the study also says microfinance affects the structure of household consumption. Households invest in durable goods, restrict temptation goods and expenditures on festivals. For someone who just spent a whole chapter ranting about GDP, it's ironic that the author focuses on business profit as the only metric instead of these quality of life improvements.	• Second, he cites a completely different study that hands out money to the poor. I have no doubt that this helps the poor. But this is not a fair comparison to for-profit microfinance. For-profit microfinance is sustainable by itself while handing out money relies on donations or taxation - of course you would expect the poor to be better off with the latter. 7.) Banking and Neoliberalism -throughout the book there's narrative towards how neoliberalism started out and how it was orchestrated by a powerful few. And also how banking is this is evil institution. This is borderline conspiracy theory material. 	• The banking system is not inherently corrupt - there were a few ponzi schemes and bad players that took down the financial system while regulators were asleep. The real question is why did the regulators fail and how can we empower them? Not burn the whole system to the ground.	• This may also be an indication of the author's lack of understanding about the financial system. I don't know. Maybe that's why he never thought about writing about whether UBI is financially feasible? 	---------------------------------------- All-in-all this book delivers nothing it promised. It doesn't make the case for UBI. It doesn't tackle any of the important topics that expert economists are thinking about on eradicating poverty. Instead it comes off like a high-school essayist who had an assignment about ""disruptive ideas for a better society"""
275,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"Description: Universal basic income. A 15-hour workweek. Open borders. Does it sound too good to be true? One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way-and in some places it isn't.Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014. His April 2017 talk continues to make the provocative case, detailing the idea's 500-year history and even its brief success in a forgotten trial in Manitoba in the 1970s. Nearly a million views later, guaranteed basic income is being seriously considered by leading economists and government leaders the world over. It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today.Utopia for Realists is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. Every progressive milestone of civilization-from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy-was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world. "
276,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62302403-michael-blue,5,"Utopia for Realists doesn't waste most of its pages repeating what any real realist will know are the major problems that face us today. ""Whether it’s the growth of the economy, audience shares, publications – slowly but surely, quality is being replaced by quantity.Rather, it gets into the discussions on solutions without apparent ideological attachment. Rutger Bregman saves us from politically taboo topics and instead just gets down to how his solutions would work and the science or facts about them. His main topic is the Universal Basic Income.""Free money: It’s a notion already proposed by some of history’s leading thinkers. Thomas More dreamed about it in his book Utopia in 1516.""""A universal basic income. And not merely for a few years, or in developing countries alone, or only for the poor, but just what it says on the box: free money for everyone. Not as a favor, but as a right. Call it the “capitalist road to communism.” 26 A monthly allowance, enough to live on, without having to lift a finger. The only condition, as such, is that you “have a pulse.” 27 No inspectors looking over your shoulder to see if you’ve spent it wisely, nobody questioning if it’s really deserved. No more special benefit and assistance programs; at most an additional allowance for seniors, the unemployed, and those unable to work. Basic income: It’s an idea whose time has come.""I've always been a fan of it, but the depth of his examination would put even the most hardline sceptic in its favour. He talks about the various trials around the world that have proven successful but that have later been squashed by our disgraceful political machinery.""Futile? For the first time in history, we are actually rich enough to finance a sizable basic income. We can get rid of the whole bureaucratic rigmarole designed to force assistance recipients into low-productivity jobs at any cost, and we can help finance the new simplified system by chucking the maze of tax credits and deductions, too. Any further necessary funds can be raised by taxing assets, waste, raw materials, and consumption.""He nicely puts the irony of our quest for perpetual growth.""Nevertheless, in the Land of Plenty we have come to the end of a long and historic voyage. For more than thirty years now, growth has hardly made us better off, and in some cases quite the reverse. If we want a higher quality of life, we will have to take the first step in search of other means, and alternative metrics. The idea that the GDP still serves as an accurate gauge of social welfare is one of the most widespread myths of our times. Even politicians who fight over everything else can always agree that the GDP must grow. Growth is good. It’s good for employment, it’s good for purchasing power, and it’s good for our government, giving it more to spend.""And dispenses with the nobility and necessity fo work.""When it comes to garbage collectors, though, it’s different. Any way you look at it, they do a job we can’t do without. And the harsh truth is that an increasing number of people do jobs that we can do just fine without. Were they to suddenly stop working the world wouldn’t get any poorer, uglier, or in any way worse. Take the slick Wall Street traders who line their pockets at the expense of another retirement fund. Take the shrewd lawyers who can draw a corporate lawsuit out until the end of days. Or take the brilliant ad writer who pens the slogan of the year and puts the competition right out of business. Instead of creating wealth, these jobs mostly just shift it around.""""In other words, the fact that something is difficult does not automatically make it valuable. In recent decades those clever minds have concocted all manner of complex financial products that don’t create wealth, but destroy it. These products are, essentially, like a tax on the rest of the population. Who do you think is paying for all those custom-tailored suits, sprawling mansions, and luxury yachts? If bankers aren’t generating the underlying value themselves, then it has to come from somewhere – or someone – else. The government isn’t the only one redistributing wealth. The financial sector does it, too, but without a democratic mandate. The bottom line is that wealth can be concentrated somewhere, but that doesn’t also mean that’s where it’s being created. This is just as true for your former feudal landowner as it is for the current CEO of Goldman Sachs. The only difference is that bankers sometimes have a momentary lapse and imagine themselves the great creators of all this wealth. The lord who was proud to live off his peasants’ labor suffered no such delusions.""""In Graeber’s analysis, innumerable people spend their entire working lives doing jobs they consider to be pointless, jobs like telemarketer, HR manager, social media strategist, PR advisor, and a whole host of administrative positions at hospitals, universities, and government offices. “Bullshit jobs,” Graeber calls them. They’re the jobs that even the people doing them admit are, in essence, superfluous.""""In Graeber’s analysis, innumerable people spend their entire working lives doing jobs they consider to be pointless, jobs like telemarketer, HR manager, social media strategist, PR advisor, and a whole host of administrative positions at hospitals, universities, and government offices. “Bullshit jobs,” Graeber calls them.

Some parts are a bit left leaning and simplistic for me (eg universal open borders) but they are certainly food for thought in a time when lots of us are questioning the world's sociopolitical direction after this crisis passes"

He doesn't offer much in terms of how to actually achieve these worthy goals, but he provides lots of good policy commentary and argument.

279,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91651788-ben-jones,5,"1-10 Takeaways:1) Universal Basic Income is a good idea that almost became a reality in the US. In 1970, during Nixon's presidency (Republican), UBI passed in the House but not in the Senate only because Democrats wished that more money was provided. In many ways, UBI is a great compromise for Left and Right politics. For the Left, UBI offers an end to poverty, allows women to leave bad marriages and is much better than Welfare (Welfare is based off of learned helplessness and suspicion where applicants need to prove their helplessness all while State employees suspiciously vet the applicants and the applicant's neighbors distrust/look down on them). For the Right, UBI increases personal freedom to change jobs, go back to school, start your own business and inherently values the judgment of the individual to solve their own problems more than the ""red tape"" of State programs/employees. The UBI tests done in the US, Canada, India, etc. showed a decrease in government spending overtime. This is the kicker. If a government invests in its citizens on the front end (UBI), it avoids costs on the backend (incarceration, Welfare, funding government programs, lost human capital). 2) 15 hr. work week is a good idea. In 1930, Keynes predicted that in the year 2030 we would have 15 hour workweeks due to advances in technology. How has the increase in technology led to us working more rather than less? Bregman talks about bullshi*t or ""shifter"" jobs. Jobs where nothing of value is created but money is shifted around. A good test of whether a certain profession is a bullsh*t job is if those workers can go on strike and then nothing changes. This very thing happened in NYC in 1968 and Ireland in 1970. In NYC, the garbage collectors went on strike, trash began piling up, the mayor declared a state of emergency and then, in 9 days, all the garbagemen's demands were met. In Ireland, all the bankers went on strike. This froze much of Irelands cash. Sounds pretty dire, right? All the economists foresaw disaster; but, Ireland not only survived but the economy didn't worsen at all. After 6 months, all the bankers came back to work. The problem with bullsh*t jobs is that you have to be smart to have them. Some of the worlds best and brightest are occupying jobs like social media consultants, high frequency traders, etc.; but, if all the social media consultants didn't show up to work for an extended period of time, would we notice? The financial sector is 7x bigger than the agricultural sector of the US; but, we would feel the absence of farmers much more than bankers. The financial sector (like other sectors in the US) have become incredibly bloated where they are more shifting wealth around amongst themselves than adding value. (The financial sector isn't all bad. It contributes to our wealth, greases the wheels of other sectors, helps to spread risks and backs people with bright ideas.). A Harvard study of 12,000 professionals found that half of them believed their jobs to be superfluous. Another study showed that the more managers a position has, the less productive it is. Many intelligent people know that their job does not add value; but they are afraid to take a pay cut so as to work on something of value. There needs to be an increase in taxes and a crack down on tax havens to decrease the amount of intelligent people pursuing bullsh*t jobs. With the brightest pursuing jobs of value, the human race will experience enough abundance to work less. When we work less, our time will go towards hobbies that in turn stimulate the economy (Henry Ford reducing work hours so that his employees had time to go places/buy a Ford automobile). Many of the necessary jobs are challenging/not desirable (garbageman, etc.). If UBI exists, the people who pursue these challenging/essential jobs can bargain for better pay/work environments because they don't necessarily ""need"" the job). 3) Open boarders is a good idea. Common objections to open boarders: people won't go back, immigrants are lazy, immigrants are criminals/terrorists (benefit from government programs without adding value), immigrants will take our jobs. Responding to people won't go back, Bregman says: Before the US/Mexico boarder was heavily militarized, 58% of Mexicans came to the US but then went back. Now, with the militarized boarder, only 7% of Mexicans return. Mexicans are still coming into the United States illegally but now with the border, they don't leave. Responding to immigrants are lazy: a second tier citizen needs to be made where people can come to the country and work but they need to wait a certain amount of time/pay taxes before receiving full citizenship with all its benefits (UBI, etc.). Responding to immigrants are criminals/terrorists: In the US, as immigration has grown, the crime rate has been going down. For terrorism, studies show that visiting other countries increases empathy, different perspectives, etc.. People being able to travel between countries should diminish terroristic ideologies. Responding to immigrants will take our jobs: When women suddenly entered the work force in the 1970's, some men were worried about losing their ""breadwinner"" jobs. This is an inaccurate view of jobs. Jobs are not like musical chairs. More people in the workforce means more consumption which means more/new jobs. Open boarders would greatly reduce poverty. 60% of people's wealth is decided by the country they are born in. Two people with the same skill set will make dramatically different amounts just depending upon where they are born. Open boarders would greatly add to global wealth. Harvard economist, Lant Pritchett, predicts that allowing people to go from country to country, similar to how goods go from country to country, would increase global wealth by 63 trillion dollars. Crazy. 1-10 Questions: 1) Why is health insurance tied to jobs in America? This locks people into jobs that might not be best for them. If people new that they didn't have to give up their job + health insurance, they would be more free to change jobs, go back to school, start their own business, etc. Especially when studies show that America will save money on Universal Healthcare (https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...). (Is the concern that certain procedures will have a long wait time?)"

My main issue is that I just don't agree with Bregman ideologically. With that being said, I don't want that to take away from the positive aspects of the book.First off, Bregman's motivation for writing this book is clear and inspiring. At times, his standpoints feel very opinionated, but overall his goal is to help readers feel like Utopia is possible. He tries to give people hope for the future. On the other hand, this book seems to assert that Utopia can only come out of more socialistic policies. Bregman cites some very convincing studies and provides well researched facts, but he makes very big assertions. He uses small case studies, to justify large-scale policies like universal basic income. I'm open to these ideas, but this book doesn't convince me. The book never really addresses why people might not support these ideas. Bregman doesn't offer or debunk most of the counter arguments.Overall, if you are interested in economics, politics, or public policy, this is a great read for anyone along the political spectrum. It definitely made me think long and hard about my standpoint, but it just didn't convince me in the end."
281,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73886-ira,4,"This is an entertaining airport lounge kind of read, filled with questions such as, why doesn't the world work better, and proof that the current mess it's in is, ultimately, unnecessary. Typically for a book of this kind is to present relatively counter-intuitive arguments supported by evidence from small scale case studies that have so far been buried under piles of governmental indifference. Homelessness would be less costly if we gave the homeless money. Work would be more productive if we reduced the time we spend on it. Performance-driven government by numbers obsessed with absurd targets and ever newer acronyms (GDP, Happiness index, Better life index, etc.) is not fit for humans. Basic income encourages industriousness. Poor people are not stupid, just overwhelmed with so many problems and economic worries that their decision making processes are impaired. And this in only the first half of the book. I'd recommend it, it's a light read, but does make you wonder, if you weren't already, why is the world in the mess it's in then? "

If you are looking for concrete proposals to develop a universal basic income system, you could be disappointed.  The book raises arguments about a universal basic income, a shorter working week - and how these can help overcoming poverty and inequalities-, which make the reader think about other possibilities and how our vision about work/job is a recent social construction.One of the positive points in the book: the reference to some experiments done already. And the critical arguments concerning GDP, overcoming poverty, the new trend of ""bullshit jobs"", jobs in the digital era, social inequality...Some unsolved issues: how a country/government/estate could afford giving a basic income to everyone (specially with open borders); and the cultural particularities (specially in poorer countries) that could make a project like this one fail. "
283,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22590771-todd,3,"I recommend starting this book with an open mind, as Bregman departs from a lot of the older left-right divides. He hopes to cast our vision to a far horizon and try to get us thinking about things in a new light, according to what humankind's progress so far might allow for in the future. He assesses that despite the relative prosperity of a great deal of the world's population (and he gives a slew of figures to illustrate that), we maybe don't find a lot of meaning to our lives and require a new inspiration to animate us. While venturing into the topic of utopia, Bregman recognizes that real utopian ideas tend to lend themselves toward fanaticism, intolerance, violence, etc., so he aims merely to provide a looser vision that the typical more detailed utopian ideal.The first part of Bregman's utopian vision is free money. That is, a universal basic income (UBI). He makes a very compelling-sounding case for it, citing all manner of examples and studies. However, a close inspection of these reveal that most of them are means-tested, that is, aimed at only the poor, and therefore they are not ""universal."" This leaves it to question if everyone received a certain amount (let's say $3,000 per month), would not everyone's expectations and expenditures merely rise to that level, such that those without additional income would seem almost no better off than those without UBI today? Remember that Bregman, after insisting that even ""poor"" people in the West are well-off compared to wealthy people in the recent past or many people in less developed countries today, are still ""poor"" because the envy they have for those even richer than themselves and this causes significant anxiety for them--""it's all about relative poverty"" (emphasis in original, p 65). Additionally, Bregman gives the impression of cherry-picking his evidence. For instance, he cites the example of 13 homeless people who received free money in England and how much they prospered. But how many of the homeless suffer from significant mental illness, and how might that affect a broader program? We don't learn from Bregman because he offers no evidence in this area. Certainly a simple UBI program would be less obnoxious and less expensive than a highly structured, regulated, well-staffed entitlement program with copious oversight. Restricting a basic income to only a means-tested basic income (not for all, but for the poor/needy), would undo some of the benefits of UBI's simplicity, but might help prevent the benefits being lost in the wash of money thrown at society, and also not involve giving away as much. Bregman does not really tackle the moral issue raised by Murray Rothbard, Robert Nozick, and the like--based on what argument may one person seize goods one person has worked for by force and just give them to another who has not? His arguments are chiefly pragmatic, and since Bregman here (and elsewhere) cherry picks and sometimes outright misrepresents his evidence, the reader is advised toward a bit of skepticism on the purely results-oriented elements.To focus a bit on that last point, Bregman claims to quote Frédéric Bastiat's tract about what is seen and what is unseen (the famous broken window story). While he starts the story accurately, he ends it by claiming Bastiat says what is unseen is ""community service, clean air, free refills on the house."" (p 103) In fact, Bastiat blew up the whole idea of consumerism that all of Bregman's economic arguments are premised on, that the development of capital is more important than spending for spending's sake. Which is precisely why we're not better off by bombing New York City every other year and rebuilding it, because what is not seen are the resources required to rebuild, while appearing to ""stimulate"" some aspects of the economy, are coming from other areas that would have been stimulated instead, and, at the end of the day, despite all that apparent ""stimulation,"" we're only as well off as we were in the beginning, whereas had those resources gone to something new, we would have had what we already had plus something new besides. Which is why Liberty is the only philosophy to embrace peace as a means toward greater prosperity.Bregman goes on from UBI toward a shorter work week, specifically, a 15-hour week. He actually alleges that ""medieval people were probably closer to achieving the contended idleness of the Land of Plenty than we are today."" (p 138). Of course they were, and it's precisely why their lives were so primitive and short, as well, a fact Bregman documents in his first chapter. Bregman makes it sound like everyone is eager to work less, citing (selectively) study after study and survey after survey. Yet, in the end, he calls for a recourse to government violence to enforce his idea, ""There is hardly a politician around still willing to endorse it."" (p 146) Prosperous people are certainly under no obligation to work 40 or more hours a week if they don't wish to, and I know some who don't. But that so many do--why did Bill Gates keep going to work day after day for so long?--is stronger testimony than any studies or surveys Bregman might cite. And if the idea of a 15-hour work week is so terrific, why do we have to point the government's gun at everyone's head to enforce it?More practically, think about what such a law would do. Bregman is a writer. So that means he would not only be forbidden from writing for more than 15 hours a week, but he could not think about his writing, do research for his writing, talk about his writing, meet with readers, sell his product, for more than 15 hours a week, combining all those tasks. How would we enforce it? With a Harrison Bergeron-style buzzer interrupting Bregman's thoughts for all but 15 hours a week? Bregman is correct that we could probably live as good a life as we presently do on quite a bit less work every week. But we would be treading water. Forget about a COVID-19 vaccine, a cure for cancer or AIDS or the common cold, flying cars, reduced pollution, improved agricultural methods, etc. Forget about progress. And if people are so stressed out from just relative inequality, even if they are far from absolute poverty, they will become more stressed when they realize they are prohibited from hustling to improve their position.Bregman also takes aim at ""bullshit"" jobs, many of which are jobs he just doesn't understand in terms of value-added. Why did people line up to bail out banks with their hard-earned incomes back in 2008 if nobody needs a bank and they don't add value? One of the ""facts"" Bregman cites to prove his contention against the financial sector is that ""For every dollar a bank earns, an estimated equivalent of 60 cents is destroyed elsewhere in the economic chain."" (p 169) This doesn't even pass the third-grader test. Given both the volume of dollars that pass through banks and the frequency with which they do, if this were true, we'd be living in the Stone Age already. I would agree with Bregman that there are a number of people who individually feel their jobs are bullshit, and I would take those individuals at their word. No doubt such things exist (I've seen some too), but much of what Bregman lumps into that category merely reveals his own ignorance about what some people do.Bregman suggests open borders. I will try not to tell him that puts him in the camp of real Liberals like that sneaky Friedrich Hayek (no, not anti-Liberal ""liberal"" Progressives, but real Liberals in favor of Freedom and Liberty). He cites the many benefits of doing so. While some of his figures might be suspect (especially since he has shown elsewhere a mighty flexibility in both picking and quoting facts), in fact it is hard to argue that open borders do anything but benefit everyone on the net. However, if combined with other things like raising taxes and providing free handouts, those with the goods would leave the high-tax areas, and those without would flock to them, so it turns out Liberty is pretty much a package deal. All of it (or at least most of it) or the pieces Bregman would cafeteria-style select might well undo to more Statist elements selected.Speaking of Liberalism, Bregman tries to crucify it, especially by citing economic crises. He completely ignores the amount and level of government intervention in each of them, as well as the contribution to economic trouble made by well-meaning interventions after the fact. For instance, he cites the 2008 crisis and says ""one free-market dogma after another crashed and burned."" (p 241) He should try reading Dick Morris' predictions prior to the crisis describing the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in creating the housing crisis and predicting its outcome (accurately). The fact that Bregman's own first chapter is pretty much a vindication of the practical benefits of Freedom, he is really only left with complaining that Freedom does not leave anyone feeling fulfilled and motivated (I would agree), and its natural outcomes (such as income inequality) leave people feeling anxious, no matter how much better off they are even being at the bottom of a rising pile. Maybe try reading Jonah Goldberg's Suicide of the West: How the Rebirth of Tribalism, Populism, Nationalism, and Identity Politics Is Destroying American Democracy for a different take on both the reasons for today's malaise and what to do about it.Make no mistake, Bregman identifies real problems in the world today. His writing style is fluid and entertaining, he makes his subject accessible to all. Some of his observations and even one-liners are as penetrating as they are entertaining. He turns out to sometimes be a little too glib, on close inspection... So when it comes time for real solutions, I would keep looking, but anyway, the book is worth reading."

At the beginning I thought that maybe I wouldn't be as interested in the book as I previously had thought, because I wasn't very agree with some of the ideas from the first chapter, but the truth is that in the rest of the book I've shared many of the opinions defended by the author.His proposals talking about working less hours, productivity, economy, poverty, politics, education, etc., are substantiated, as well as the critics he makes about the underdog socialism that is destroying itself... I save for myself a quote from this book: ""Don't let anyone tell you what's what. If we want to change the world, we need to be unrealistic, unreasonable, and impossible.

The idea of needing 'utopian' goals to orient our work, or the need for radical ideas to have any kind of change or reflection of our current paradigm, was super motivating for me and also very useful to how I look at the work and role of governments. A lot of public documents and public ethics talk about the role of government to work for improving the ""public interest"". We can't know what that is without big ideas that look beyond incrementalism. Step-by-step planning is necessary in complex systems but we need forward looking and ideas that change the way things are done for incremental steps to have any meaning. "

It's a great book for giving facts, but there doesn't seem to be any underlying criticism of the current mindset beyond ""oh, we were wrong, silly us!"". It plays as flippant at worst and toothless at best, and that can be really incongruous when you're discussing vast income inequality or life expectancy.
