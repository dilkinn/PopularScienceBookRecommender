The author came across as a huge fan of Elon Musk; I would guess at least 80% of the book is about Musk and SpaceX. That could be because SpaceX seems to be the company that's really speeding forward, or maybe because Bezos and BlueOrigin are very secretive. It could also be because Bezos owns the Washington Post, where the author works. He might be trying so hard to be balanced and fair in his reporting that he focused too much on Musk instead. Branson's Virgin Galactic and Paul Allen's company (the name escapes me and I've returned the book already), are barely footnotes. The whole thing could have used one more good copyedit; some things were worded really awkwardly (As I suspect this review is. Forgive a tired reviewer, please), and sometimes the same information was presented twice in quick succession. Still, I enjoyed learning more about our private sector space companies and found myself idly daydreaming about taking a vacation on the moon when I'm an old woman. These guys believe it will happen, and it's impossible not to share their dreams."

But, somehow, this book, even though it's supposed to combine all of this, didn't click with me. Instead, I felt like I was reading a monstrously overblown article from some newspaper. Some ingredients were missing. I do appreciate that the facts were all right-ish, they did this, invested that, the rocket blew up, another one returned and had legs, the citric acid was important, blah blah. Something was still missing, some core details, backgrounds in other places. It felt like the author was preoccupied with stuff other than what he wrote. Many things felt to be edited out. Overall starting rating: 5 stars+1 star: space and business-1 star: disjointedness and overall bad, no, horrible structure. -1 star: things that felt edited out-1 star: unimportant or maybe important details left hanging+1 star: facts used, hallelujah-1 star: abruptness of topics changes and the overall journalist approach to writing, the whole read as unfinished draft.Final rating: 3 stars.Q:“Paul, isn’t this better than the best sex you ever had?” Branson asked him, as the spaceship climbed higher.“If I was this anxious during any kind of interpersonal activity, I couldn’t enjoy it very much,” Allen thought. (c)Q:AND SO THE moon. Again, the moon.The greatest achievement in the history of humankind, revisited. Only now, so much time had passed that the twelve Apollo astronauts who had walked on the lunar surface were dying off, one by one.James Irwin, Apollo 15, was the first to go, in 1991.Alan Shepard, Apollo 14, died seven years later.Pete Conrad, Apollo 12, passed a year after that.Then Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11.Then Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14.In January 2017, Gene Cernan, Apollo 17, the last man to walk on the moon, died. (c)Q:“We believe space mining is still a long way from commercial viability, but it has the potential to further ease access to space and facilitate an in-space manufacturing economy,” an analyst for Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to investors. “Space mining could be more realistic than perceived… a single asteroid the size of a football field could contain $25 billion to $50 billion worth of platinum.” (c)Q:Google executives Larry Page and Eric Schmidt invested in Planetary Resources, which planned to mine asteroids. Filled with precious metals, the asteroids are the “diamonds in the rough of the solar system,” Eric Anderson, the company’s cofounder, told CNBC.Asteroids have “rare metals, industrial metals and even fuels,” he said, “so we could create gas stations in space that would enable us to travel throughout the solar system just like Star Trek.” (c)Q:FOR WEEKS, MUSK and a small SWAT team of SpaceX employees had spent their Saturdays working on the Mars architecture, and the presentation. But they seemed to overlook a key detail—the Q & A session that would follow.…Another guy told Musk he wanted to give him a comic book about the “first man on Mars, just like you.” But he couldn’t get by the guards protecting the stage, and asked, “Should I just throw this onto the stage?”Then there was the woman who asked, “On behalf of all the ladies, can I go upstairs and give you a kiss, a good luck kiss?”Musk shifted stiffly as the crowd started whooping and hollering, as if at a brothel.“Thank you,” he offered, awkwardly. “Appreciate the thought.” (c) Why is this an issue, really? Q&A sessions can include lots of weirdness and still not be a doozy. This one definitely wasn't, so what was the author trying to tell in this paragraph? Q:For all its accomplishments, NASA could no longer lay exclusive claim to the title. The space shuttle program had been a compromise that didn’t deliver on its goal of providing reliable, low-cost access to space. It was pricey and dangerous, taking the lives of fourteen astronauts. Bush’s Constellation program, which was supposed to take humans back to the moon, had been killed. NASA’s replacement program, which was supposed to get to Mars, didn’t seem within decades of doing so with the overbudget, behind-schedule SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft.Musk, then, filled a void that was larger than his space company. (c)Q:They were a mix of marketing and fantasy that went viral, a sign of the emergence of a new leader in human space travel. (c)Q:Investors, long leery of the risky industry, started to wade in. In 2014, the global space economy totaled $330 billion, a 9 percent jump from the previous year and up from $176 billion in 2005, according to the Space Foundation, a nonprofit space advocacy organization. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX, backing another of Musk’s ventures: a bold plan to build a constellation of thousands of small satellites that would swarm over Earth, beaming the Internet to remote parts of the world. (c)Q:For decades, the engine was the most important part of the rocket. But this rocket had something altogether different, something that had not been necessary before.This rocket had legs. (c) And? What for, how did it fit into the design, what was it about, why was it needed, did it improve anything? Ugh!Q:SpaceX had demonstrated it—Pad 40 alone was a master class in creativity, not to mention the innovative ways it had built its rockets in-house. What, she wanted to know, was Blue Origin’s secret?The answer, in part, was citric acid.For a while the company had been using a toxic cleaner for its engine nozzles, which it intended to reuse. But that cleaner was expensive and difficult to handle—it had to be used in a separate, clean room because it was so toxic. Then someone discovered that citric acid worked just as well. So, the company started buying it by the gallon, an easier, less expensive solution that worked better.“Now I’m the largest purchaser of lemon juice in the country,” (c)"
2,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"After decades of state delays, the visionaries are turning to Mars cities and asteroid mining.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Science fiction, especially space operas, hard science fiction, and the classic series, have dealt with the issue in a vast variety of ways. Which variants will prevail in which time frame is the exciting question. Where, in principle, it is more likely that the cultural and ideological barriers will increase with spatial separation by the vacuum between colonized planets.Every visionary and thus also the group pursue ideologically and economically different approaches to implementation. Accordingly, different professional competencies, blind spots, and individual mistakes arise. The research must also be adapted to the core areas of the company so that diversity is still increasing. At the same time, however, often the same developments are researched several times by different players. Even ideologically, depending on the company´s philosophy, the emphasis seems to be shifting additionally.The sociological, political and economic components play an underestimated role. Not only ideological but also economic misconceptions can delay development. Whether the opponents see the despair of their faith or a threat to their economic concept, remains the same. The damage in the delay of development is done in both cases. These factors have led to inglorious deletions and budget cuts in space programs, especially in the previous government budgets. So much about the worldwide far too long starting phase for space programs.The main focus of the book is on Musk, which may also be due to its extroversion. About a quiet man like Bezos, who prefers to remain silent in business, is just less to find and secrecy is prioritized. Speaking of a conflict of interest for the author to stay objective, because Bezos owns the Washington Post where the writer works, would be too far-flung and speculative. By contrast, Richard Branson and Paul Allen polarize less, though Branson is as compelling as Musk. But his space tourism is not so visionary put in relation to the other concepts.Conceptually I am purely subjective and intuitive with Bezo's opinion. First, the industrial infrastructure for mass production in space has to be created. Without asteroid mining and terraforming, Musk's concept of a Martian city is too risky both technologically as well as economically. Only when one can produce and grow independently, one has achieved true independence and, above all, survivability. Besides, economic dependencies and extortions on Earth often led to conflicts in the past. Maybe a bad way to start with new colonies that start revolutions after decades. All already had, didn´t work well.What delayed development in recent decades, apart from the lack of funding, was above all the lack of innovation. Just as incalculable as the breadth of inventions in the 21st century is their utilization for space travel. The main focus will first be limited to terrestrial use until one can start manufacturing in larger capacities for space and especially in space. Nanomaterials, graphene and quantum computers will go the same way as industrial steel, microprocessors or plain mirrors. It takes time to perfect and automate the manufacturing process, but then it can be produced 24 hours a day in each environment.Concerning monopolization, it is more extreme than ever. Every nation on earth could claim colonies with a few ships in the past. Other companies could produce similar products and compete with the first ones in the market. But acquiring the, partially patented, knowledge about space technologies via reverse engineering is almost impossible in the time necessary to be competitive.The effect is compounded by revenues from resource extraction, terraforming, development, and occupation of new territories and asteroid mining. What cements the lead is the advantage of being able to test all new technologies and devices directly on site, or in this case, the different vicinities. The extremely expensive laboratories and experimental setups, as on earth, are not necessary. And whoever is first on Mars will most probably be the first to enter all other worlds. Not to mention the prices that can be charged for all private and state customers.Also, the corporations and states will also seek their legal departments or international courts to influence the newly defined laws in their favor. If one imagines the power already concentrated on earth in very few hands, one can not rudimentarily imagine its extent in a few hundred years. The first person on a planet also has no reason to fear any controllers who look at his fingers. No witness, no judge, no crime.Only a few huge companies, often in cooperation with large states and their military and exclusive supply contracts, will be able to do so. Thus, the development of infinite vastness will be endowed with finite capacities and opportunities for all smaller companies, states, and individuals. Similar to many of the science fiction works that inspired and delighted the great visionaries as young people. And without which these endeavors might never have started so early on this massive scale. And in the far retrospective out of a long time in the future, this delay could have been fatal in many ways. Because as so often applies: All eggs in a basket = Bad idea.Nach Jahrzehnten staatlicher Verzögerung heben die Visionäre zu Marsstädten und Asteroidenbergbau ab.Science Fiction, insbesondere Space Operas, Hard Science Fiction und die klassischen Serien, haben die Thematik in verschiedensten Spielarten ausgebreitet. Welche Varianten sich in welcher Zeitspanne durchsetzen werden, ist die spannende Frage. Wobei es grundsätzlich wahrscheinlicher ist, dass sich die kulturellen und ideologischen Schranken bei räumlicher Trennung durch Vakuum zwischen kolonialisierten Planeten verstärken. Jeder Visionär und damit auch der Konzern verfolgen ideologisch und ökonomisch verschiedene Ansätze zur Umsetzung. Entsprechend entstehen verschiedene Fachkompetenzen, blinde Flecken und individuelle Fehler. Die Forschung muss auch auf die Kerngebiete der Firma adaptiert werden, so dass die Diversität noch steigt. Gleichzeitig aber oft mehrfach an denselben Entwicklungen geforscht wird. Selbst ideologisch scheint sich je nach Firmenphilosophie die Schwerpunktsetzung zusätzlich zu verschieben. Dabei spielt die soziologische, politische und ökonomische Komponente eine unterschätzte Rolle. Nicht nur ideologische, sondern auch wirtschaftliche Falschannahmen können die Entwicklung verzögern. Ob die Gegner eine Anzweiflung ihres Glaubens oder eine Gefährdung ihres Wirtschaftskonzepts sehen, bleibt sich gleich. Der Schaden in der Verzögerung der Entwicklung wird in beiden Fällen angerichtet. Insbesondere in den bisherigen staatlichen Programmen haben diese Faktoren zu unrühmlichen Streichungen und Budgetkürzungen bei den Raumfahrtprogrammen geführt. Der Hauptfokus des Buches liegt auf Musk, was auch an dessen Extrovertiertheit liegen dürfte. Von einem ruhigen Mann wie Bezos, der sich auch geschäftlich lieber in Schweigen hüllt, ist schlicht weniger zu finden. Von einem Interessenskonflikt zu sprechen, weil Bezos die Washington Post gehört bei der der Autor arbeitet, wäre zu weit gegriffen und spekulativ. Richard Branson und Paul Allen hingegen polarisieren im Gegensatz dazu weniger, obwohl Branson ebenso mitreißend wie Musk ist. Aber sein Weltraumtourismus ist in Relation gesetzt nicht so visionär.Vom Konzept her bin ich rein subjektiv und intuitiv Bezos Meinung. Es muss zuerst die industrielle Infrastruktur für die Massenfertigung vor Ort im Weltraum geschaffen werden. Ohne Asteroidenbergbau und Terraforming ist Musks Konzept einer Marsstadt sowohl technologisch als auch ökonomisch zu riskant. Erst wenn man autark produzieren und damit wachsen kann, hat man wahre Unabhängigkeit und vor allem Überlebensfähigkeit erreicht. Noch dazu führten wirtschaftliche Abhängigkeiten und Erpressungen auf der Erde in der Vergangenheit oft genug zu Konflikten.Was die Entwicklung in den letzten Jahrzehnten verzögerte waren neben der mangelnden Finanzierung vor allem die fehlenden Innovationen. Ebenso unabsehbar wie die Breite der Erfindungen im 21 Jahrhundert ist deren Nutzbarmachung für die Raumfahrt. Das Hauptaugenmerk wird zuerst auf eine terrestrische Nutzung beschränkt sein. Bis man beginnen kann, in größeren Kapazitäten für die Raumfahrt zu fertigen. Nanomaterialien, Graphen und Quantencomputer werden den gleichen Weg wie Industriestahl, Mikroprozessoren oder schlichte Spiegel gehen. Bis zur Perfektionierung und Automatisierung des Fertigungsprozesses dauert es seine Zeit, aber dann kann 24 Stunden am Tag produziert werden. Es ist von der Monopolisierung her noch extremer als jemals zuvor. Jede Nation konnte auf der Erde mit ein paar Schiffen Kolonien beanspruchen. Andere Firmen konnten ähnliche Produkte herstellen und mit den Ersten am Markt konkurrieren. Aber das einmal erworbene und teils patentierte Wissen rund um die Raumfahrt über reverse engineering zu erwerben, ist beinahe unmöglich. Was den Effekt noch verstärkt, sind die Einnahmen aus Rohstoffabbau, Terraforming, Erschließung und Inbesitznahme neuer Territorien und Asteroidenbergbau. Was den Vorsprung endgültig zementiert, ist der Vorteil, alle Technologien und Geräte direkt vor Ort zu testen. Die extrem teuren Labore und Versuchsaufbauten wie auf der Erde sind nicht notwendig. Und wer als erster auf dem Mars ist, wird auch alle anderen Welten als erster betreten. Von den Preisen, die für sämtliche privaten und staatlichen Kunden verlangt werden können, ganz zu schweigen. Ergänzend werden die Konzerne und Staaten auch ihre Rechtsabteilungen beziehungsweise internationalen Gerichtshöfe bemühen, um die neu zu definierenden Gesetze zu ihren Gunsten zu beeinflussen. Wenn man sich die auf Erden bereits in sehr wenigen Händen konzentrierte Macht vorstellt, kann man deren Ausmaß in ein paar Hundert Jahren nicht ansatzweise ermessen. Der Erste auf einem Planeten hat weiters keinerlei Kontrollinstanzen zu befürchten, die ihm auf die Finger schauen.Nur wenige sehr große Firmen, häufig in Kooperation mit Großstaaten und deren Militär und exklusiven Lieferverträgen, werden dazu in der Lage sein. Somit wird die Erschließung unendlicher Weiten mit sehr endlichen Kapazitäten und Möglichkeiten für alle kleineren Firmen, Staaten und Privatpersonen ausgestattet sein. Ähnlich wie in vielen der Science Fiction Werke, die die großen Visionäre als junge Menschen begeisterten und inspirierten. Und ohne die diese Unterfangen vielleicht nie so früh in diesem Ausmaß begonnen worden wären. Und diese Verzögerung hätte sich, in der Retrospektive, auf mannigfache Weise rächen können. Denn wie so oft gilt: Alle Eier in einem Korb: Schlechte Idee."
3,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60710386-dee-arr,4,"The full title of this book, The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos, emphasizes the battle between two of the main figures in the book. While I understand the name-dropping can potentially help in selling more copies, I feel it is important to mention others featured in the book: Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder), Burt Rutan (not a “Baron,” but important for his role), and Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Group).I chose to read this book because of my previous interest in space exploration/colonization, which unfortunately did not extend much further than what NASA had accomplished. While I was aware of three of the names involved (Bezos, Musk, and Branson), I did not know who had accomplished what. Author Christian Davenport’s book helped to fill in my knowledge gaps. I questioned whether the book would be on the dry side, but the author’s storytelling style soon proved me wrong.Mr. Davenport lists an extensive number of sources he employed to write the book, along with interviews with the people directly involved in this new space race involving individuals and companies. The end result is an inside look at the dreams and fears along with the failures and successes of each entrepreneur. All possess the ultimate goal of enabling mankind to be able to safely travel in space, yet each also has variations of what he believes can be possible. The author not only details what has happened, he outlines the future plans of each company.I didn’t find this to be a quick read, as there was much to absorb. That said, I found the book to be engaging, and I didn’t feel the urge to speed-read through the content. Mr. Davenport presents the information as if it were a book-length feature article. Extremely informative for anyone wishing to learn what has been going on with the space program over the last twenty years. Four stars.My thanks to NetGalley and Perseus Books (Public Affairs) for an advance copy of this book (Publish Date: April 17, 2018)."

This is a very interesting read if you are into space exploration and the advances the private industry is doing towards the goal of sending humans to mars soon. The book focuses on big names like Jeff Bezos and Elon musk and 2 other billionaires and the work their companies are doing , the book gets repetitive at times and doesn’t really have anything new after the first 100 pages but like I stated before if you are into space and eccentric billionaires then this is the book for you . "
5,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2616607-nikki-the-crazie-betty-v,5,"I requested this book from Netgalley for a few different reasons. The number one reason being that I’m slightly obsessed with humanity’s scientific journey to attempt to get us in to space. My husband has heard me say more than once that, given the opportunity, I would gladly upend my life and go live on Mars to assist in terraforming. I’ve just always been interested in space, and space exploration and ultimately am a little resentful of the fact that I will most likely never get to see what’s beyond our Earth with my own eyes. I wanted to know what future generations have to look forward to with regard to space travel, and how we’re going to get there. I’m also a huge fan of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, so part of me requesting this was a little bit of fangirling. Ultimately this ended up being an exceptionally interesting read about the engineering, politics, social-economics, and costs involved with getting us into space as a long-term solution for habitation and reparation to our Earth. Both of these men are scary smart and I truly believe that if anyone is going to get us into space, it’s going to be these 2. They’ve both had huge battles to get to where they are, whether it be using their own personal money to fund their space projects, fighting NASA for the right to do so, or suing the government for asinine contractual requirements and pressures.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in what our current space program looks like, and how the commercialization of space flight is ultimately going to be what gets us off our blue planet.Received via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."
6,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37313792-charles,2,"An over-hyped, biased reportageThe business of space, shown mostly in the exploits of three billionaires, Elon Musk, of SpaceX, Jeff Bezos of Blue Origin, and Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic. A comprehensive treatment by the author of the commercial spaceflight revolution, more focused on the characters and personalities of the major players than the technology. If you are a fan of privatization, this book will be of great interest, but to me it is sounding a bit over-hyped. The narrative is classic libertarianism advertisement: Private industry, “astropreneurs with skin in the game” will come to the rescue of big government, get Nasa out of the game and get us into space. This is not in fact, what Elon Musk among other people has said. He has expressed a profound admiration for NASA and stated that his space investments should advocate expanding and improving NASA's capability. So much for unbiased reportage. Space doesn’t exist in isolation from society and the needs of humanity. And one can legitimately ask if space exploration, like healthcare, education, or prisons, will benefit or suffer from having the profit motive injected into it. I may be in the minority here, but the writing, IMO was less than engaging, and some of the fanboy clichés were cringeworthy."
7,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"Over the last decade I’ve occasionally seen news items relating to Space X or Virgin Galactic, but hadn’t paid them too much attention. I’m more engaged with the subject now, having read this remarkable story of how a group of billionaire business rivals - each working separately – created start-up space technology companies that have added a new dimension to the space industry. The book predominantly features the pugnacious Elon Musk, the flamboyant Richard Branson, and quiet man Jeff Bezos. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen is another who features.As boys they were all mesmerised by space exploration, and as adults each has used their enormous wealth to pursue that dream. As the author points out, they were also driven by a feeling that NASA, that once-visionary organisation, had become ossified and risk averse. In the 1970s everyone imagined there would be people living in moon bases by the 21st century.Throughout the book the author uses the fable of The Hare and the Tortoise to illustrate the differing approaches of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Two years ago Elon Musk announced his audacious plan to take humans to Mars by 2025. In contrast Bezos prefers to talk only “when he has something to talk about.” They are a real contrast. For the moment though, the hare still seems to be holding the lead.The book seems to have been well-researched and doesn’t wander off its chosen subject. It’s also pitched at a suitable level for the general reader. One of the messages I picked up was how much truth remains in the old cliché, “Space is Hard.”If I have a criticism, it’s that I didn’t find the early part a particularly quick read. Overall though I enjoyed it. After finishing I actually went onto Facebook and followed the pages for Space X, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. A book that gets me to do that has to rate pretty highly."

9,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13997511-anoop-dixith,5,"This book was truly the most investigative of all non-fictions I've read this year. The amount of research that has gone into the writing of the historical quirks, chronologies, and stories embedded in this book is enormous. I picked up this book because I was getting more and more interested as well inspired by private space entrepreneurship - including space tourism, reusable rockets, cargo logistics, economically cheaper private contracts, extraterrestrial mining, satellites, and of course, the actual R&D, and exploration beyond our beautiful planet Earth. After all, it's about the space – the final frontier. On involving me immensely on those lines, the book didn't disappoint one bit. As you would have already guessed, the book is about the latest breed of barons - the space barons. But unlike robber barons and oil barons (or even bitcoin barons), the space barons were ALREADY rich before they became that, and it's that riches they're pouring into space exploration, for a variety of reasons, profits is a primary one among which. The book is mostly about, obviously, SpaceX of Musk, Blue Origin of Bezos, Virgin Galactic of Branson which is also immensely contributed towards by Microsoft legend Paul Allen(Stratolaunch Systems). However, the book is so detailed that it also includes various other firms and barons whose stories get intertwined with the mainstream space exploration. Andy Beal of ""The Corporation"" of gambling, Kistler Aerospace etc. The 800 pound gorilla - like antagonists of the story are the usual suspects - Boeing and Lockheed Martin.More the companies themselves, the book is also largely a testament to the ambitions and tenacity of the founders, most notable of Bezos and Musk. NASA gossiping about Musk as ""There will be bumps, but he will not fail"" is a compliment as good as any for Falcon rockets. And for Bezos, this was all in his to-do list from way back, as evidenced by his valedictorian speech which was about...space. He said ""Space, the final frontier, meet you there"".The book keeps you captivated with stories that you'd have never heard of, like Bezos almost dying from a crash when he was looking for places in Texas for Blue Origin; his Zelfram LLC fake corporation that bough all the Texas ranches and named them after frontier explorers like James Cook and William Clark; Bezos's extreme brainstorming for building rockets that included even a bull whip as long as train before settling on chemical rockets; Musk's audacious Falcon roadshow; Bezos's and Musk's grandfathers' entrepreneurship stories and those of their will for exploring new frontiers; Branson's catastrophic transatlantic boat ride and many more of that sort! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who'd love to read how an industry shapes itself because of the audacity of a few to dream and accomplish. "
10,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17495858-missy,2,"Space Barons failed to capture my interest in the long run. The initial chapters about Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos weren't well organized, but they had enough interesting bits that I kept coming back to the book. When Burt Rutan's story was introduced, however, the author lost me. Mr. Davenport followed the same patten too many times: tell a bit of a story, introduce a new character, swing back in time to fill in some history of the character, then proceed in the main story on to the next character. Much about the failed progress of NASA was repeated again and again. This is an interesting topic, but it needs to be organized differently.

11,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740420-christina,4,"3.5 stars. Despite what the subtitle suggests, Davenport's book focuses on four billionaires -- Musk, Bezos, Paul Allen, and Richard Branson -- and plays off of two parables -- the tortoise and the hare and David and Goliath -- to explain how their efforts to commercialize space has(n't) worked out. The Goliath of the space industry is the revolving door between the Pentagon, NASA, and the dominate industry players, Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Musk sued the Department of Defense and NASA several times over no bid contracts, setting him up to be the hero of the story. (To the book’s detriment, Musk’s abusive behavior in the workplace is glossed over as being a symptom of his genius.)Yet, as Davenport documents, Musk’ role as the hare versus Bezos’ tortoise turns SpaceX into the Goliath. The narrative shifts as more information about Bezos’ work is available – Blue Origin is notoriously secretive – and the book’s effusive praise for Musk starts to balance out. At this point, more information about Allen and Branson’s efforts are also included in the book, although neither story is ever fully interwoven into Davenport’s tortoise-hare and David-Goliath structure. It makes for a clunky narrative; more Sunday feature than cohesive book.Still, despite the clunky narrative, Davenport’s book offered this commercial space novice quite the education. It’s a great overview, and Davenport’s tradecraft as a journalist is evident as he offers enough technical detail to be interesting but not overwhelming. I’m curious to learn more about Bezos and Musk’s plans for space, even if so far that curiosity has only extended to following SpaceX and Blue Origin on Twitter."

In the 1990s if I’d thought space would someday be something other than NASA dead end shuttle bullshit, I probably would have gone into aerospace rather than computing and computer security. While computing and networks are one of the big engineering achievements in their own right (and in the form of AI, possibly greater than space, and on par with life extension as most important area of development), there is just something about space which makes it appealing."

I aspire to have this level of multi-tasking ability someday! Seriously though, this is some of the fluffiest and most inane piece of ""journalism"" I've ever read. I picked up this book hoping for an educational look at the nature of the space industry, its political economy, the technical challenges of building spacecrafts, etc. The book has a thin layer of all this, but its coating what is a mostly hollow and childish puff piece about how cool and sexy billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are. A sizeable chunk of the book is just copy-pasted from corporate press releases and publicity speeches, as well as the vague hopes and dreams of the various CEOs and how X and Y events in their childhood inspired them or whatever. Anyways if know absolutely nothing about space travel, and are allergic to any level of depth or analysis, and are mainly interested in helping develop the personality cults of already cultish billionaires, this is the book for you!

Perhaps still too far-fetched for some, the race to be the first commercial shuttle between Earth and Mars is a very real and burgeoning enterprise, with unthinkable funds being expended (and sometimes exploded) along the way. Recent movies and books such as Interstellar (2014), The Martian (2011; 2014), and The Terranauts (2016) have begun to imbue collective popular consciousness with the rather old space ambitions, but it is often hard to separate fact from fiction when they are so tightly coupled. This is where Christian Davenport’s forthcoming book, The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos, fills a rapidly widening void. A reporter for the Washington Post, Davenport has extensive material and history from which to work, and a reporter’s knack for stating facts and extracting the perfect array of material to tell the story.Read full review: http://www.chrisviabookreviews.com/20..."
17,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/631001-francis-tapon,5,"My wife is from Cameroon so she thrilled that the first creature that America sent into orbit was from Cameroon.The creature was named Enos. He was a chimp from Cameroon. He flew aboard the Mercury-Atlas 5 on November 29, 1961. Enos logged three hours and 21 minutes in space. He paved the way for the first American orbital flight just three months later.I’m a fan of space exploration and astronomy. I’m a even bigger fan of the privatization of spaceflight so I’ve been following the news fairly closely.Still, just like I didn’t know about Enos the chimp, Christian Davenport’s upcoming book, Space Barons: Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos, delivers plenty of facts that I didn’t know about.If you’ve been meticulously following the headlines, then I suppose there’s little new in Davenport’s book. Test yourself.Did you know that . . .. . . Jeff Bezos nearly died in a helicopter crash?. . . the big aerospace giants (e.g., Boeing) called SpaceX an “ankle biter” and that Elon Musk would basically call Blue Origin the same thing years later?. . . Bezos and Musk are rocket geeks but that Richard Branson knows little about them?. . . Paul Allen loves space exploration but is terrified of the risk of losing a human life?. . . Bezos is the turtle and Musk is the hare?Soviet space featsAlthough it's not mentioned in the book, I recently learned that Americans were NOT the first to land something on the moon. The Soviets were. They landed Luna 2 on the moon's surface a stunning 10 years before Apollo 11 (the first humans to land on the moon). It's just more proof how we glorify our own country. I wonder if you grew up in Russia, you'd hear nonstop about Luna 2 but almost nothing about Apollo 11.Yes, it's more impressive to land humans on the moon and return to them safely to Earth than to crash an object into the moon, but we still ought to acknowledge the Soviet accomplishment and not ignore it. Fortunately, Americans do talk about Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.Still, that's just the tip of the Soviet Space Program's iceberg. To quote Wikipedia:[The Soviets were] responsible for a number of pioneering accomplishments in space flight including the first intercontinental ballistic missile (R-7), first satellite (Sputnik 1), first animal in Earth orbit (the dog Laika on Sputnik 2), first human in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1), first woman in space and Earth orbit (cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6), first spacewalk (cosmonaut Alexey Leonov on Voskhod 2), first Moon impact (Luna 2), first image of the far side of the moon (Luna 3) and unmanned lunar soft landing (Luna 9), first space rover (Lunokhod 1), first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth (Luna 16), and first space station (Salyut 1). Further notable records included the first interplanetary probes: Venera 1 and Mars 1 to fly by Venus and Mars, respectively, Venera 3 and Mars 2 to impact the respective planet surface, and Venera 7and Mars 3 to make soft landings on these planets.So let's stop thinking that Americans were the only space pioneers. Sadly, Space Barons continues this sad tradition of ignoring the pioneering accomplishments of the Russians. For example, it doesn't even mention MirCorp, which sent the first space tourist (and wannabe space baron), Dennis Tito, to the International Space Station.Instead, Space Barons focuses mostly on Bezos and Musk since the biggest space barons today. The book discusses Paul Allen, Richard Branson, and Peter Diamandis. Since Elon Musk and SpaceX are such great marketers, you've probably heard a lot about them and seen some of their videos. What I like about Space Barons is that it delves into the mysterious Blue Origin. I just wish Davenport's interview with Bezos was a bit more revealing than it was. Fortunately, Blue Origin has come out of the closet and has shown off some amazing feats. Check out these two videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSDHM...This second video really could use narration/music and an altimeter, but it's still stunning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJgh...Blue Origin claims that they land at 1 mile per hour, but that landing certainly doesn't look that soft. It looks at least 5 miles per hour, if not 10. Regardless, Skywalker Manniquin survived. Space Barons does not mention several companies that plan to mine asteroids. That's a pity. Perhaps Davenport believes that other companies are too small and/or their leaders aren't true ""barons"" yet. Despite these shortcomings, I loved reading Space Barons. It's one of those rare books that I devoured. I read a book a week. This is one that was hard to put down. It's one of my favorite books that I read in 2017.Unfortunately, you won't be able to read it until April 17, 2018, which is when the book is made available to the public.The main downside of the book is that by 2020 it will be out of date since progress in space is happening quickly. So pre-order it today and read it once you get it.Verdict: 9/10 stars"
18,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Not long ago, I reviewed Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance, and The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by Brad Stone. Both books are well done. They're the product of professional journalists who are good at what they do. But neither book comes close to Christian Davenport's superb new book, The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos, in offering insight into the personality of these two extraordinary men who are the central characters in his book.Illuminating personal detailsThe personal details about the lives of Musk and Bezos are abundant and highly revealing. For example, here is Davenport with an anecdote from the early life of Elon Musk: ""He had such concentration that as a toddler in Montessori school, his teachers would have to pick him up—in his chair—to keep him moving from task to task."" And this about Bezos: ""His girlfriend from high school had once told an interviewer that Bezos had founded Amazon in order to make enough money to start a space company."" Davenport notes that Bezos ""conceded that there 'is some truth to that.'""The pivotal role of four private space companiesDavenport's subject in The Space Barons is the pivotal role of four billionaires and the private space companies they've started in the emergence of the rejuvenated space industry. All four men envision lowering the cost of space travel and making it more accessible—and Davenport makes clear that they have taken great strides toward this goal. Although Musk and Bezos occupy center stage, Paul Allen (cofounder of Microsoft) and Richard Branson (the Virgin companies) also play large roles. Davenport tells the tale with great assurance in prose that is always lively and engaging. He interviewed all four of his subjects and many of their associates (and critics) as well. This is the remarkable story of four self-made billionaires whose great wealth and passion allowed them to pioneer space technology that NASA had grown too old and bureaucratic to develop itself. If humankind ever succeeds in populating the solar system, historians may conclude that the determination and resources of these men were largely responsible.Four distinctive personalitiesMusk, Bezos, Allen, and Branson are very different from one another, though each is undoubtedly brilliant in his own way, and at least three of the four are science fiction fans. Musk is the youngest of the lot—he was born in 1971—and by far the brashest and most impulsive. His company, SpaceX, has made the biggest splash to date and has generated by far the most revenue, but Musk has a bad habit of setting impossible deadlines for what he envisions as the principal goal of his efforts: building a city of one million people on Mars. He has also gotten his way at times only by suing NASA and the Pentagon. By contrast, Bezos and his company, Blue Origin, have been the tortoise to SpaceX's hare (""Slow is smooth and smooth is fast"" as compared to ""Head down. Plow through the line."") Bezos' highly secretive company has consistently been wary of publicizing its achievements.Both Musk and Bezos (born in 1964) envision traveling into space on their own rockets. Allen and Branson, who are older—born in 1953 and 1950, respectively—do not contemplate the trip to Mars that Musk hopes to take. Allen's part in the emergence of the new industry was for a time very limited by his fear that lives might be lost in the process; later, however, he staked out a unique project of his own: building a spaceplane larger than any airplane ever built. Branson, who is even more flamboyant than Musk, is all showman and marketer. His contribution was initially to promote the work of aircraft designer Burt Rutan, assuming the controlling interest in Rutan's company in place of Allen and only later getting into the business of building rockets, as Musk and Bezos have been doing for nearly two decades.Differing views of humanity's future in spaceElon Musk is single-mindedly focused on building a large city on Mars. Jeff Bezos does not share this focus. ""'There's all kinds of interesting stuff you can do around the solar system,'"" he told Davenport, ""'but the thing that's going to move the needle for humanity the most is mining near-Earth objects and building manufacturing infrastructure in place . . . That's the big thing.'"" Given the obstacles to living on the surface of Mars that I have learned through other reading, I tend to agree with Bezos.About the authorChristian Davenport is a reporter for the Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos. He acknowledges that it is ""somewhat awkward writing a book about someone who could have you fired."" However, his editor, Marty Baron, ""has made it clear that [the Post] covers Jeff's companies as it would any other"" and encouraged him to write the book. The Space Barons is Davenport's second."
19,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"This book is a thorough and professional review of the current state of space flight in the US. As the cover promises, it’s a tale filled with the current rock stars of capitalism: Musk, Bezos, Branson, et al. And a few names that have made history but aren’t quite as familiar: Burt Rutan, Mike Melvill, and a host of others.It’s a book of tales, not technology, and that’s great for most readers. And the stories and subplots are magnificent and glorious; just what you’d expect from men who have already achieved wealth and fame and now have the time and resources to feed the soulful flames that burn within. These are men not content to sit by the pool, but whose inner curiosity, in its immense proportions, define who they are.The book is well researched and easy to read. I definitely came away with a much fuller portrait of Musk and Bezos (a study in contrast, for sure), in particular, and while it would be impossible for any author not to have an opinion about the players, Davenport is a pro and works hard to simply tell their stories and not show his own cards.I only have two issues with the book. The first is common to all discussion involving the tech industry. There is a lot of effort expended differentiating between the commercial space industry (Musk & Bezos), the government (NASA), and the “contractors” (Boeing, LMT, & the military-industrial complex). The commercial companies (particularly SpaceX) are, of course, the quixotic “everyman,” the feisty, never-sleeps underdog who refuses to give in to convention and who is obsessed with saving money and making time. In that narrative, NASA and the contractors are old, overweight, slow, expensive, and risk-averse. It’s the now familiar Silicon Valley (the figurative SV) narrative and it’s starting to sound a bit over-hyped and dated. Narrative is a function of perspective. Replacing the obscenely expensive latch previously used on the nose cone by the grumpy old men with the one used on the stall doors in the bathroom sounds ingenious; until it fails and we discover that the latch was expensive for a reason. It’s not the wrong idea, mind you. But the distinction between genius and rash judgment can be a subtle one that is only apparent with hindsight. Which brings me to the second concern. There is an underlying implication that NASA and the contractors all get their money from the taxpayers but the ""commercial"" companies do not. The “astropreneurs”, in other words, have skin in the game and according to the SV narrative, that is the essence of genius and value. And that, too, is true to a point. But all of this delightful technology ultimately comes from the American people. All of the engineers, whichever entity they work for, were all educated in large part with taxpayer funds, they drive on taxpayer-funded roads, they enjoy the protection of taxpayer-funded defense, etc. It’s not that the entrepreneurial perspective is false, but it is often over-stated for the world we live in. Whether we accept it or not, we now live in a collective society; made all the more collective by technology.And on a related note, of course, there is a libertarian message from the tech entrepreneurs – regulation will kill the industry and the opportunity that is space. Again the narrative is classic tech libertarianism. But space doesn’t exist in isolation any more than tech ultimately does. If a commercial rocket plunges into a populated area, the fact is that the government/taxpayer will be expected to come to the rescue. I am as anguished by the US lack of commitment to space as any of the people in the book. I was a teenager when Armstrong walked on the moon and I remember it vividly. It was liberating for every man, woman, and child on the planet in a way almost nothing since has been, although the fall of the Berlin Wall came close. But we were able to do it, in part, because we responded to President Kennedy’s bold challenge as a nation. It was a collective effort.I think the space entrepreneurs covered in this book are remarkable men and women. They represent a core element of the American spirit. But at the heart of that same spirit is another American ideal; “It is amazing what can be accomplished if we don’t worry who gets the credit for it.” "
20,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36740745-anna-shelby,4,"The Space Barons tells the stories of the four billionaires - Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Paul Allen.The companies profiled have set huge milestones as privateers in space industry. Davenport chronicles the tumult of the beginnings of Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, SpaceX and Mojave Aerospace Venture. The first liftoffs, explosions, failures and plain daring stubbornness of the mentioned, to advance in the field of space flights. Additional to interviews, following books influenced Space Barons: Ashlee Vance’s Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Brad Stone’s The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, and Julian Guthrie’s How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight.I’ve read some of them but nonetheless it was a pleasure to read the stories again (cz, you know, I worship SapceX, no surprise here). The individual progress of the companies is well structured. The narrative takes turns, paying attention to each one of them in linear order.It’s informative, without diving into deep technical and engineering details. Emphasizing the vision to get humans to space (or orbit at least). SBs focus is on always on the persons, driving the companies. I would’ve liked more insight into the company’s daily business, marketing strategies and so on. The beef between Musk and Bezos deserves less pages – hardly anyone missed it on twitter or anywhere else on he internet, for that matter.A clear picture emerges by the end, from the first steps the industry has taken to the place we are in now.I liked the included photographs in the last pages but would’ve appreciated having them in the corresponding chapters.All in all, it was a nice, fast paced read.

21,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,4,"A good book, providing an overview of the commercial space industry and the wealthy, visionary individuals who are its prime drivers. The author, journalist Christian Davenport, covers many layers. These include the differences between commercial enterprises and government projects along with the correlation of rushed development with high risk. In the process he manages to tell not just about the steady commercialization of space access but also looks at the role of dedicated and wealthy entrepreneurs in forcing that process. The narrative mostly concentrates on Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origins, and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. But there is a much wider cast, including NASA officials who are slowly moving from managers of their own products to contracting & regulating officials buying the services of private enterprise. The author demonstrates how the presence of market competition, leaping forward after the 2009 cancellation of NASA’s Constellation program, has unleashed a string of technological achievements which are making space access more affordable. A great book for those wanting to know more about the current state of space technology and the ways market competition is re-shaping how we view access to and use of space. "
22,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/238704-kristiana,3,"Space barons is a good compiling of the separate space ventures and companies currently in the business. It has a narrow focus, which is wise. I have not yet tired of hearing of spacex’s success, ingenuity, can do spirit or Elon musk’s biting charm and brazenness. Davenport’s approach fills in the gaps for me on what is going on in the different companies and how they came to be.I can’t imagine this is a satisfying read for someone who is already up to speed on the industry and excited about its future.It’s an entry level overview of where we’ve been.It is venerable toward the history of space travel and the men who have been there, but it’s more a compilation of facts, providing few unique insights or critiques. Perhaps that wasn’t the point of the book. I enjoyed it, it’s an engaging quick read"
23,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7434712-sandeep-tammu,2,"This is a disappointing book. Honestly, the book felt like it was rushed to publication. It doesn't have enough insights to warrant a special book. Tesla, Virgin Galactic are the currently the most hyped space-tech companies in the media. If you are into this topic, you must have already read enough about them through news articles and videos. This book reiterates the same events and does not have any compelling narrative. The only insightful thing I have found in this book are the stories about Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin. Unfortunately, they constitute very less in this book.I would suggest to skip this book, even if you don't know much about SpaceX or Virgin Galactic. I'm sure there are better books out there. Elon Musk's biography is a good start."
24,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2194759-kevin-furr,4,"Published in 2019, here's an engaging history of space commercialization efforts so far. By its nature, it covers primarily Elon Musk, secondarily Jeff Bezos, and to a lesser degree Richard Branson and Paul Allen (the latter two leaning heavily on designer Dick Rutan). If our Science Fiction dreams come true, and someday space travel is a robust part of the everyday private economy, these early years and their history will someday be seen as extremely important. In recent years I've devoted a lot of care to mapping out areas of knowledge that I want to retain and pursue and learn, so that I know how productively to spend my time. Space commercialization -- its history and progress -- is one of those areas, and this book is my own first step in fostering this specific branch of knowledge."
25,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14597053-dylan-jeremiah,3,"This book was a decent timeline of the past and present of commercial space, unfortunately only the epilogue was looking ahead, predicting, and anticipating the future of space travel/colonization. Well researched and interesting to see the egos at play and the different ""tortoise and hare"" approaches by Bezos and Musk respectively. The narrative around Branson falls off about two thirds of the way through and isn't mentioned at the end despite being the third ""rival"" to Bezos and Musk. The presumed demise wasn't mentioned which would be interesting to see. "
26,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31243906-john-taylor,2,"The idea of space exploration and it being privately funded combine to make a potentially interesting book topic. Several ultra wealthy people with a passion to push the bounds of space could lead to a compelling read, but it didn't. ""The Space Barons"" was bogged down throughout. It was page-after-page of essentially the same micro story being told over-and-over. This company, run by this successful entrepreneur, is testing this rocket and it failed because of xyz or it succeeded. Repeat over and over. I felt like I was reading about someone coding software. I suffered through much of the book. It could (should) have been an interesting long article in a newspaper, rather than an entire book. Light on content and the story never moved forward. "

It was extremely insightful on where #spacetravel is and where it is going.The wonderful thing is, that private sector dreamers like (Bezos, Branson and Musk) are reigniting the possibilities of going to space. Making it affordable, reusable and fun!Breaking through the heavily regulated and controlling government monopoly and cost waste. These folks are building, engineering, and doing.Fabulous Disruption! They use any failures as a key ingredient to learning, by building it better. You want that continuous experimentation and deployment.We are are SO far behind in this area, it’s great to see it being pursued so passionately. #julesverne and #hgwells I think would be happy about this."
28,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246265-nick,5,"This is a really fascinating look into the world of the space industry. The author focuses on four main companies that started in the US in the early 2000s, which I found to be very interesting. While SpaceX has acquired a lot of fame in the past few years, I was surprised by how far back it went and how long it took to get to this point. The author also helped shine a light on some lesser-known companies like Blue Origin.Although the US-Russia space race ended, competition in the space industry has not ceased and is bringing many benefits that will have long-term value."

I knew most of the Musk history from Vance's book. Worth reading!"
30,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541586-dan,5,Davenport tells a fine story about Musk and Bezos and how they are revolutionizing the space launch business on their way to colonizing Mars. We really are witnessing history that might set our species on a different path. If it sounds merely farfetched instead of ludicrous it's thanks to the work of Musk and Bezos who have spent their own fortunes to seek out a new horizon. This is a must read for anyone with even a passing interest in space.

But the author's inclination to mix imperial and metric units when describing different aspects of the same object is infuriating. And he tends to repeat facts, sometimes even duplicating entire sentences, throughout the book. To top it all off, he misspelled Roald Amundsen's first name, writing Ronald."
32,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/330360-mark,4,"A book like this is inherently a snapshot in time. This field is moving so quickly, there's no way to keep completely up-to-date in a book. For instance, it didn't include the flight of the Falcon Heavy, the announcements about Blue Moon, or the decision for Stratolaunch to cease operations. That doesn't really take away from the book, though, as it still provides useful background and detailed information up to a time."

This was a nice in depth focus on SpaceX, which only formed a small part of the later book.Which was nice about this book is the whole competition from Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen for the quest into space, which I didn't previously know about. I did know about Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic, but didn't know how that tied in with the other names mentioned, and how much was his own involvement.The ambition of these billionaires is astounding. A lot of the book focuses on Elon and SpaceX. I'm guessing it is largely because he made the biggest progress upfront.According to the book, the main push is to colonize Mars. Whether that is what will end up happening or not, remains to be seen, however, the direction these guys are going, and the advances in technology is sure to open new and unimaginable frontiers in the future. Making sci-fi a reality.One nice touch in the beginning of the book was the friendship between Jeff Bezos and Neal Stephenson (a sci-fi author I really like). And how the two came up with the initial ideas/plans on how they will make space travel a reality."

If you're a space nerd and have been following the industry closely you won't find much new information here. Also if you love the technical aspects of space travel this book will not satisfy you. It mainly covers Musk and Bezos and the race between them, with some focus also on Branson and Paul Allen. All in all an ok read, but those looking for new information will be disappointed"

The author weaves a wonderful story. Even rocket science sounds easy to understand. A must read if you want to expand your horizons of understanding( pun intended).

54,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34175122-maaike,3,"I quite enjoyed reading it, however the book was more superficial than I would have liked. The American nationalism and capitalist ideals are never questioned. Issues such as the risk of life for astronauts are adressed, but always in a sort of roundabout way. This is essentially a book about some big, rich and crazy men chasing their very expensive boyhood dreams of colonising the cosmos. Which , yes, is fun to read about. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of launches and crazy parties. But I would've liked some more food for thought. Also, at times the book got a bit repetitive. I got tired of the whole ""NASA/the government let us down so now we need to rely on the Russians, the horror""narrative after two chapters, and the hare and tortoise comparison was clear the first time Davenport introduced it, it did not have to be repeated twenty times after that. ""Their [Musk's and Bezos'] race to the stars was driven not by war or politics; rather, by money and ego and adventure"" this sentence sums up the conclusion of the book. The question I am left with, is if money, ego and adventure are better foundations to build a space age on than war and politics. "

It was on last year's Goodreads Choice Awards so I figured it was worth a try and that I might learn something.In cause you're wondering I didn't really learn much. And I quit this book around 50 pages in. This book is ridiculous. The author is a fanboy of the worst kind, which not only made it annoying to read the book but also was just plain laughable.  He tried to make it sound like the men who are now interested in space were on some kinds of epic journeys, instead of just bored rich men.  And on top of it, he wasn't even a good writer, the cliches had me rolling my eyes so hard I'm surprised I didn't hurt myself. I was bored, annoyed and I'm pretty sure at one point I threw up in my mouth just a little.This book was an utter waste of time and if you were considering reading this book, take my advice and don't.

60,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65903752-tejas-sathian,5,"An engaging profile of the key players in an exciting new industry, and one of my favorite recent business books. The book makes the case throughout that NASA and the political system have let us down when it comes to space exploration - failing to extend the energy and purpose of the Apollo era, allowing technological progress to stagnate, and failing to encourage innovation via contracting arrangements that protected incumbents over encouraging upstarts. Central to the vision of many of the eccentric billionaires involved in the industry is the conviction that bringing humans into space in some form or another is essential to earth's future. Re-usability of rockets formed the key new idea that would make space travel cheaper, accessible to more people, and open up new sets of possibilities. While competition between the barons became intense at times, the analogy was often made to the dawn of the Internet as a new frontier, in which the collective growth of the industry benefited everyone.Story begins with Bezos scouting for land in West Texas (buying properties totaling half the land area of RI), using an initial company name of Zefram LLC, and hiring Neal Stephenson as Blue Origin’s first employee - Bezos wanted to make enough money in his primary job to start a space company (reference in his high school graduation speech; tied to his grandfather's experience in DARPA; influence from O'Neil visions of space colonization). Continues with the story of Beal Aerospace, a predecessor to SpaceX - founded to disrupt a sclerotic government run business, aspirations to protect humans from future disasters, failing in the face of competition from government favored incumbents. Musk bought Beal's launch site and picked up the fight against monopolistic practices, with an obsession on reaching Mars. Musk focused on limits of space program; most technology had improved exponentially but rockets hadn’t. Musk sued NASA over contracts (GAO sided with SpaceX), but made a lot of enemies in the process; Pentagon launches became crucial in war on terror and led to the consolidation of Boeing/Northrop into a monopoly supplier to Pentagon; Musk contested these unsuccessfully.Contrast between SpaceX and Blue Origin evident in their slogans. SpaceX: head down and plow through line. Blue origin: slow is smooth and smooth is fast (use of hare as symbol).Rutan: goal to build first private space shuttle as govt has abdicated its monopoly. Spaceship 1 piloted by Melville. Allen invested, attracted Branson’s attention, sold to Branson and became Virgin Galactic. 'Screw it let’s do it' - Branson much more risk tolerant than Allen.Growth of industry: Formation of personal space flight federation to preempt regulation. DARPA partnership with SpaceX given need for cheap rockets to launch weaponry. NASA program to encourage private companies to build delivery service to ISS - COTS award, first external money for SpaceX (sign of NASA moving in new direction and big defense contractors didn’t bother to enter). SpaceX won official NASA contract to supply the ISS in late '08 - key landmark and first external funding. Obama era: budget cuts to NASA, speech favoring commercial contracts for space transit, picture next to Musk at SpaceX. 39A launchpad - Blue Origin entered fray to compete but SpaceX won (first head to head clash). Bezos mission to recover engine from Apollo 11 from ocean - relic compared to reusable rockets. Musk vs Alliance aka fighting the military industrial complex; Blue Origin partnership with alliance. Virgin Galactic test pilot death in Mojave. Blue Origin - first rocket to reach space and land vertically. Blue Origin was funded entirely by Bezos - his plan to sell 1bn in Amazon shares a year to invest in Blue Origin. Idea of the Great Inversion - aim to mine for resources and energy in space, preserve earth. Allen eventually returned to the business - to fly rockets, experiments, maybe people on a space plane. Virgin vs Blue Origin debates over customer experience - rockets or plane. Importance of collective growth in industry - creating infrastructure for space exploration, making costs cheaper, using tourism as a gateway to other progress, creating practice/reps needed for other purposes. Space as new frontier like internet as rockets and satellites become smaller and cheaper. SpaceX evolving its mission - more non Mars flights. Bezos delivery service to moon as foundation for settlements; ice on moon meant potential for fuel (via hydrogen and oxygen)."
61,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32852828-george-siehl,4,"I watched an interview with author Christian Davenport on the events section of www. csis.org and decided to read the book. Good decision. Davenport, a writer for the Washington Post on space and defense issues, faced the delicate challenge of writing about the man who owns the newspaper, Jeff Bezos (of Amazon fame), and Bezos' space business rival, Elon Musk. There are other deep pocketed space entrepreneurs in the cast, as well. Paul Allen and Sir Richard Branson of all the Virgin things, are among them.The essential story is the effort of four, and more, billionaires trying to restart the U. S. manned space program which had become moribund in the hands of NASA and the big corporate aerospace companies. Boeing and Lockheed Martin were the two heavyweights in this field. Since the last astronaut left the moon in 1972, Americans had been no further in space than the Space Station.The rich guys had different motivations. Bezos was a space enthusiast since he was five; Musk was a disruptor of existing commercial systems; Allen had space interests and concern with America's image; and Branson was enthused to find a new venue in which to star. Each started, or became involved with, a private start-up firm to put people back in space. Musk and Bezos compete to achieve this goal in different ways. Musk is characterized as the hare, Bezos the tortoise in their mode of operation. Paul Allen's venture, SpaceShipOne, started quickly, winning the ten million dollar Ansari X prize for being the first to fly a spacecraft to an altitude of 62 miles, land safely, and do it again within two weeks. The spaceship was flown aloft to 50,000 feet by an aircraft, then released to rocket to the higher altitude. Allen was worried by the risk to the pilot. After winning the prize, he sold his interest to Branson. Branson planned to carry space tourists aloft to the edge of space for several minutes, then return them to land at the launch site.Musk's company, SpaceX, had both commercial and exploration goals. He planned to carry cargo and astronauts to the Space Shuttle and colonize Mars. He built a series of ever-larger rockets which could return and land after lifting the flight capsule. Reusing the primary launch vehicle would greatly decrease the cost of going into space. Lower costs would allow more aggressive space ventures, especially manned flights. Musk had to fight the agencies he hoped to have as customers, NASA and the Defense Department, to be allowed to compete for contracts. The major contractors did not want to lose their privileged status (and big contracts). They belittled SpaceX, but did not consider it a real threat, calling it an ""ankle biter."" Musk turned to lawsuits and publicity in his campaign to join the club of space contractors. His business plan was to move fast and push the envelope in developing his re-useable rockets.Bezos applied a stealth mode, shunning publicity, and moving much more slowly. Like Musk, his Blue Origin was making all their rockets in-house, although at a seeming glacial pace. The company mantra was ""Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast."" Bezos was looking to a space tourism business, lofting passengers to the edge of space for several minutes to experience weightlessness and take in the unique view. Longer term, he too anticipated moving people into space on a permanent basis. His vision was to protect Earth by moving people to other planets or structures so the home planet could be zoned ""residential and light industrial."" All the dirty stuff would be done in space.Davenport's readable journalism provides biographies and character profiles of his subjects. He also offers insights into the technology of space and the mire of Washington politics. He notes thatPresident Obama cancelled George Bush's planned space program, Constellation, because it was over budget and behind schedule. That ended the manned space program. Obama seized the private sector initiatives that were appearing as a way to appease critics of his action. The program he initiated that still relied on the major contractors, Davenport notes, also turned out to be over budget and behind schedule. A frequent reference is made to the phrase, ""space is hard."" So is government.This book provides an overview of a timely subject that is rooted not only in technological progress but in national self-identity, as well."
62,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114779360-namrata-goswami,5,"Space Barons by Christian Davenport is an essential read for those looking to understand the emerging new space industry in the U.S. The book is clear, well written and engaging. Davenport does a brilliant job in highlighting the impact this industry will have on U.S. space capabilities, to include its latest Artemis Moon program. The book is rich with personal narratives plugging into the reasons why these space barons, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Paul Allen, Richard Branson, are interested in space at all. They could have been satisfied with the success of their earth-based enterprises like Paypal, Tesla, Amazon, Virgin groups, or Google and yet longed for the eternal possibilities space offered humanity. Turns out, space shaped their personalities and motivations as individuals from an early age and the quest to become a multi-planetary specie set in early. These motivations inspire them to do what they are doing today: invest in space planes, space tourism, reusable rockets, a viable space transportation architecture, in space manufacturing, lunar bases and Martian habitats: a multi-generational project which these barons hope to start and leave behind a level of space infrastructure long after they are gone, so that generations coming after them could utilize and take advantage of. Space Barons offers the reader deep insights into how these astropreneurs decided to invest in space, the quest to overcome the challenges living in space throws for us, and the lifelong commitment to open up space to all of us, and not just accessible to elite astronauts selected and funded by the exclusivist state projects. The book acquires relevance today as we witness a race to return to the Moon, from China, Japan, India, the U.S, Russia. In this race, the private space sector will play the role of not only a force multiplier but could also acquire individual capacity to travel to deep space and settle in celestial bodies. This will imply the requirement of clear legal frameworks. Christian Davenport does a great service by taking us into the lives of these men, and their motivations. More importantly, there are sections in the book that offers insights into the U.S. public-private partnership, the rivalry between old and new space (Boeing, United launch Alliance versus Space X), the intense rivalry between Musk and Bezos especially the legacy issue of who launched the first reusable rocket into orbit, and the opening up of space for private investments. I highly recommend the book for those looking to understand the motivations, ideologies and attendant risks associated with these private investments in space. For as Chris poignantly writes: this race between the barons that has started today will continue shaping imaginations decades later long after the hare (SpaceX) and the tortoise (Blue Origin) are gone, once humanity passes the edge of space, and into the infinity of space ""where there is no finish line""."

So Obama ended it.NASA chose many of its astronauts from the US Navy and Marin Corps because they are courageous battle-tested fighter pilots.

64,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"The Space BaronsChristian DavenportA fascinating book that examines the key non-governmental players in the future of space travel, who are, basically, Richard Branson and, to a much greater extent, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. There are many interesting observations and thoughts throughout — for example, all the players recognize that the NASA Apollo approach is a gargantuanly wasteful way to fly into space … it would be far better, they say, to reuse the rocket booster and discard the payload (exactly the opposite approach of the Space Shuttle, for example, which kept the lander and discarded the rocket after every launch). Musk’s company, SpaceX, was the first to land a heavy rocket after it fired — their Falcon 9 rocket landed flawlessly after a couple botched attempts. But Bezo’s Blue Origin did it later that same year — the video of their booster landing, after seemingly plunging to earth, is just amazine. SpaceX has also taken supplies to the ISS. The contrast in the two men’s philosophy and approaches are carefully documented and amazing as well — Musk is a daredevil, a risk-taker who wants to disrupt quickly, loves publicity and is prone to huge claims, like cutting the cost of space travel to 10% of what NASA pays. Bezos, a space junkie from the time he was a child, is content to work in secret, step by step, though his plans are huge. Bezos also has more money, an almost unlimited amount that he generates by selling a small percentage of his Amazon stock each year. Branson is a bit player in this story, though the origins of Virgin Galactic are only peripherally his — he purchased the technology from rocket pioneer Burt Rutan, who won the X Prize and is a member of the Air and Space Hall of Fame. Also, Virgin has missed their goal of tourist flights into space by a decade and counting — when the company launched in 2004, he promised (and sold tickets for) flights by 2009. Anyway, no need to recount the entire book — suffice it to say that if you’re interested in the future of space flight, you should read, indeed devour, this extremely well-researched and beautifully written book. Also, if you dislike Amazon’s policies towards their workers as much as I do, you might gain a somewhat different perspective on Bezos, at least a little.Grade: A"
65,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15169578-robert,2,"Disappointing. I really didn't enjoy this book, although it took me a while to figure out why. A major reason is that not much happens in the book, it's very repetitive without much progress. Each chapter is basically the same, a billionaire does some research, runs some tests and launches a rocket. Then in the next chapter, a billionaire does some research, runs some tests and launches a rocket. After that, a billionaire does some research, runs some tests and launches a rocket. The problem is that there is no payoff to all this rockets, the story doesn't lead anywhere. By the end of the book they are still years away from sending people into space and decades from space tourism. This isn't entirely the author's fault, but they could have written about a more interesting topic. Or made the story interesting, to be honest the writing was dull.Another problem is the book is very one sided. We hear almost everything from the point of view of Elon Musk and SpaceX, to the point that the book feels mostly comprised of SpaceX press releases. (Probably because Jeff Bezos is so publicity shy). When Musk criticises NASA, we don't get anyone else's viewpoint, so we just have to take his word that he is the best and everyone else is inefficient or corrupt. We never hear from NASA or SpaceX's rivals or any journalists or experts to provide context. In fact we never hear anyone who questions if it is worth investing billions in space or if any of the proposals are realistic, feasible or even worth doing.Instead it is constantly repeated about how clever and innovative SpaceX is, while Lockhead and Boeing are corrupt and wasteful. Safety standards are dumb wastes of money which our brave genius Elon Musk finds ways around. Honestly, this got really dull after a while and the book felt like an advertisement for Elon Musk and the Libertarian Party. SpaceX & Musk are presented as almost perfect and if they ever lose, it's never because they're not good enough but because their rivals cheated and are corrupt.All in all, a dull book that mainly parrots press releases without fully engaging with the topic."

67,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57744738-andrew-roy,4,"The Space Barons is written in an accessible way and deals with fascinating characters and narratives. Musk and Bezos are reshaping the world and set the milestones of the generation, so it was really valuable for me to understand each of their mentalities and what each has accomplished. As I expect of great nonfiction books, I feel like I have a deep understanding of space politics and the two primary companies, Blue Origin and SpaceX, where I knew extremely little about any of it before and didn't even recognize the name Blue Origin. Another fun element of reading it for me was the insight I got in what science fiction ideas are realistic and feasible, and how things could really develop. The book's pacing can be a bit inconsistent - there are thrilling moments and also chapters that drag, and some huge successes and failures are not expounded upon or built up at all. The narrative of the tortoise and hare was also a bit overused and felt like an oversimplification of the companies, though as a broad narrative it is certainly effective in conveying the message. The ideas and personalities in this book are just so grand that I couldn't help but love space and root for all of their success. One idea that struck me as super brilliant was Bezos' idea of flipping industrialization, with Earth as fully preserved and we mine resources from asteroids. Their innovative ways of thinking about space travel opened up my mind, from reusable rockets to optimizing the customer experience or minimizing costs. This is a very good account of Musk and Bezos' relationships with space travel and is accessible to the general public."
68,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"A bit tough to rate. Ideally, this would be 3.5 stars on a half-star rating. With the average here at over 4 stars, I moved it down.It's decent on the competition between Bezos and Musk, and Branson as a No. 3, but there's not a lot here beyond newspaper story level.And, it does have some observations that maybe at times, federal regulations are a bit overdone, and aren't re-examined often enough. OTOH, on things like recycling a propellant tank, I understand that the tank was used by NASA for manned launches and Musk of course was doing unmanned launches. Big safety margin of error difference.Next? Musk has had his own series of faux pas, some after the time frame of this book, like the non-tunnel under LA. That said, Consumer Reports has dinged the reliability of Tesla cars for some time; Robinson apparently doesn't find it relevant.Next? He talks about Bezos playing catch-up on bidding for government contracts. Well, only within the space world. He apparently doesn't find it relevant that via Amazon Web Services, already then, had contracts with the CIA and the NSA, and of course, the NSA and CIA both have a history of launching spy satellites.Given Davenport's work at the Bezos Post in intelligence and national defense issues, he knows all of that, too.At this point, in mid-review, I dropped it down to 2 stars."

What is Jeff Bezos doing in space? Where is NASA these days?These were some of the questions that prompted me to pick up this book. The book lacks technical depth or nail biting storytelling but it does a good job in keeping novices like me engaged and immersed.The focus is definitely on Musk and his baby SpaceX and to a lesser extent on Bezos and his clandestine Blue Origin. Both Musk and Bezos are Internet prodigies who have no formal training or professional experience in rocket science. Making humans a multiplanetary species is a grandiose vision and probably no other challenge comes close to its level of difficulty or complexity. This could probably be the reason why these highly successful men are willing to risk their reputations and endure the pain of a long, tedious, expensive space journey with little or no guarantee of success in their lifetime.In fact, what I found more interesting is to learn about men who attempted to conquer the final frontier before Musk and Bezos. Stories of people like Andrew Beal who started Beal Aeropspace and Burt Rutan, the winner of Ansari X Prize, are inspiring and they laid the foundation for Musk and Bezos. They also exposed politics in the industry and the battles that lay ahead of anyone attempting to challenge the status quo enjoyed by NASA, Boeing and Lockheed. In summary, this is a great introduction to anyone trying to understand what is happening in space right now and how it is possibly going to change mankind in the future by making human beings as a multiplanetary species.

Right now!This time, it isn't a space race between two superpowers locked in a nuclear-powered Cold War. The crazy wealth generated by tech companies have created new billionaires, and these billionaires grew up awed by the Apollo-era of human spaceflight. Except now, they can put their money where their mouth is.The book is largely chronological, and traces the exploits of Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla), Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin, Amazon) and their companies, as well as Paul Allen/Richard Branson (SpaceShipOne & Virgin Galactic), and a few other small players. It weaves a tale of ankle-biting startups, and the quest for commercial operations to expand the saga of human spaceflight in suborbit, orbit, and elsewhere in our Solar System.They are trying to take us where NASA and Roscosmos have, by Apollo-era standards, utterly failed for more than a generation. There have been some terrible failures, and inspiring successes, and increasing momentum and hype to match the similarly increasing challenges facing these new Space Barons.

That Falcon 9 rocket lit up the sky, and got the whole city to stop still. What a sight it was. I'll never forget it.Space Barons is a book about the same Falcon 9, its humble origins and its not-so-humble founder's history. The book chronicles Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin and the dawn of the new Space Age. It was a bl0w-by-blow account of these companies, the founders' inspiration to start them and how they survived failure and uncertainty and a lot more to get where they are today. Davenport seems to have done a lot of research, and he clearly had access to a lot of people at these places, in telling this story.A tiny complaint would be that he didn't seem critical enough of these companies, or atleast, seemed fascinated by his subjects. I also didn't see much of the deputies, the No. 2s of these CEOs, who each run so many businesses. It felt like their show - when it was actually their brilliant vision, combined with their deputies' brilliant execution. I would have to loved to see more of Gwynne Shotwell here for instance.

I did get out of this book what I'd hoped for--a better understanding of the ""who's who"" within the private space sector beyond Elon Musk = SpaceX and Jeff Bezos = Blue Origin. It also captured the importance and historical achievement taking place with each launch better than any 30-second newsclip lost in the shuffle of the 24-hour newscycle ever could. The other thing this book did well was provide a decent profile and chronology of each SpaceX and Blue Origin. Although the majority of the time fell on SpaceX, followed by Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic felt a bit like background noise. There was an explanation of each company's ethos and culture, but the constant pivot between them and from event to event made for a somewhat jarring reading experience. The narrative of what each company is trying to accomplish and how came through, but unfortunately the details got a bit jumbled together.In all, I was hoping for a bit more. Perhaps I just prefer books that do a deeper dive. Hidden Figures is an example where Margot Lee Shetterly gave intimate biographies of both the women pioneers of the space program and the aeronautic technology their calculations helped make possible. The Space Barons on the other hand feels like it only ever skims the surface."

I read the large print edition, which perhaps wasn't quite the same as the normal edition, but here are some examples of errors:Page 232, ""'I'd ... fly up a mountain invert and fly back down the other side...'"" He flew up a mountain invert? Or should there be a comma in there?Page 232, ""Many of the bodes lying there, entombed, frozen reminders of the perils of exploration all the way to the top."" Where's the verb?Page 291, ""By building them horizontally, you reduce the risk of having employees as they work high off the ground, she explained."" Maybe you reduce the risking of having employees working high off the ground, or reduce the risk to employees as they work high off the ground, but you don't reduce the risk of having employees. I'm not going to list them all, but grammar was a distraction throughout."

Full disclosure: I worked for NASA on private sector space utilization over 3 decades ago, so I'm not exactly new to the subject. I'm not sure if a completely uninitiated reader would find it quite as simple to follow Davenport's plot. His strategy is to focus on the personalities - chiefly Bezos and Musk, with Branson as a strong supporting actor - and that's mostly effective even if I did tire by the end of the tortoise and hare metaphor. I also feel the book might have been strengthened by a little more context on the other major players in launch services - United Alliance and Orbital Services - who hover around the fringes like the Empire seeking to quash the Bezos/Musk Resistance. But those are, for me, quibbles. The book reminded me what an outsized impact the Apollo missions had on my generation, drawing many of us into majors and careers in the sciences and engineering. Hopefully, the work of the visionaries Davenport profiles will have the same effect on a new generation."

SpaceX has flown and landed many rockets, but Blue Origin, the secretive space company, is now gaining a public persona, with their attempt to buy Launchpad 39-A at Cape Canaveral, which SpaceX won. SpaceX launched an original Tesla Roadster into space, for the test flight of the Falcon Heavy. They've docked with the International Space Station with their Dragon capsule. They just got approval to fly humans onto the ISS from NASA, the agency that put the Mercury, Gemini, and the Apollo ships into space. SpaceX just announced the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket), the rocket that will transport people from Earth to Mars. Blue Origin is more of a private endeavor, with their New Shepard rocket."
76,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8373937-kelly-russell,4,"The Space Barons is such a great book. Mostly covering the history of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos Blue Origin, the book also tells some great stories about Richard Branson and Paul Allen and their contributions to the new Space Race.There were several wonderful stories of which I was totally unaware. Just a year after founding SpaceX, Elon Musk already had a seven-story rocket, which he strapped to a custom trailer and hauled across the country. Musk, ever the 'Showman,' showed up in Washington, DC and parked his rocket in front of the FAA's 100th Anniversary celebration of the Wright Brothers first flight. If NASA hadn't noticed him before, they noticed him then.Jeff Bezos dreamed of Space since he was five years old watching the Apollo 11 lunar landing. Years later, with wealth he gained from creating Amazon, he paid for and was part of a Deep Sea expedition to recover Apollo Saturn V F-1 rocket engines from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. In it's 275 pages there's a lot of good stuff. An Excellent Book. Highly recommend."
77,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22387172-tom-oman,5,"This is a book about crazy and exciting times, which is the present day of a privately capitalized space race. And mainly the fact that individual entrepreneurs are now leading the way into not only exploring interplanetary space, but also making it commercially viable. It’s a super interesting time to be alive. Another remarkable notion is that most of these guys, but mainly Musk and Bezos, seem to have had a long standing aspiration to explore space or at least lay the ground work for future generations to do it easier. This drive to get to space predates the financial success of those two, with lots of proof lending credence to these claims. These kinds of pursuits are one of the best side effects of having such immense amounts of wealth concentrated in private hands because of the globalized spread of capitalism. Especially how much more effective the private sector is compared to how governments traditionally operate. What makes this time (and this book) so exciting is that it feels like we are all along for the ride with these guys, so lets see what happens next."
78,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96062068-kenny-mccabe,4,"Overall I enjoyed this book. It gives quite the in-depth view of the last 20 years of private space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. At times it does read more like a newspaper article than a book, and as others have mentioned it does skip around quite a bit in the timeline. I have seen it criticized for focusing too much on Elon Musk and SpaceX, and while the author may indeed be a Musk fanboy, considering what SpaceX has accomplished in this field (specifically, in the ""Quest to Colonize the Cosmos"") in comparison to the other companies, it's not unreasonable that the main focus of the book would be on SpaceX. That being said, Musk's company was not the exclusive focus. The author writes significantly of Bezos and Blue Origin, as well as Richard Branson, Paul Allen, and other important names in the field. My main criticism of the book is that it did not appear to have a clear 'thread'. Much of it felt unfocused and random in terms of the pacing. The book was roughly chronological, but perhaps not sufficiently so. I believe it could have been better organized."

It shows how these individuals are competing against each other, in a good sense, in the race to be the leaders of the emerging space industry. This book is full of interesting and insightful stories mapping the creation of space companies such as SpaceX (Elon Musk), Virgin Galactic (Richard Branson) and Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos). These stories shows how many obstacles people behind these companies had to face and conquer to get where they are today. It shows how high can the costs of progress be. And, most importantly, it shows that with vision, dedication and perseverance everything any feat is possible, even building a successful space company.I recommend this book to everyone interested in space as well as building companies based on ambitious visions and goals. This book will show you that everything is possible. It is a great read."

In an industry that has been so hostile to new entrants, they have made a distinct mark and accomplished a lot in a decade to advance the state of the art in space. The first half of the book was full of amazing new information - like Jeff Bezos's grandfather L P Gise being a high ranking official at Atomic Energy Commision in Sandia and working for DARPA, I also didn't know about how much of impact one of my favorite authors Neal Stephenson had on Jeff Bezos in starting Blue Origin in the first place. I knew he worked there but this book made me aware that he said the magic words ""why not do it now?"" or something like that and was the first employee until 2007. A lot of depth in his stories come from his experience at Blue Origin for sure. Paul Allen's cautious involvement with SpaceShipOne, eventual sell-off to Virgin and return was interesting too. He seems to be approaching the launch from a very different perspective -- airborne launch vehicles than land based that everyone else is doing.The rivarly between Musk and Bezos was described in great detail and the ongoing metaphors of tortoise and hare started getting tiring towards the end. Bezos started with a far larger fortune than Musk and could afford the secrecy, whereas Musk needed every bit of bravado and public goodwill and money to get ahead. Words were thrown about but the competition makes the industry move forward, faster. All in all, this is a great book to learn about the current space race and the ""Space Barons"" and how we got here."

And our voyage into it comes not at the hand of nations or governments but private enterprise. It is incredible to consider the work that is being done to make space travel accessible to mankind and to get a glimpse of the faces of the franchises that are making it possible.With that said, this book at point reads like a case study in which the author collects and then publishes notes. There are several places where it reads like a briefing rather than a novel or story which makes it abrupt. Also, a personal pet peeve of mine would be the repetition of phrases and ideas not to solidify or clarify a point but almost lazily and absentmindedly (an example would be the changes in size of cell phones and how that relates to satellites moving from dump trucks to shoeboxes). In all, an enjoyable book to read and dream and ponder but I wish the flow of the book would have been a bit smoother."

Still, hero worship of billionaires playing out their fantasies leaves me cold. Turns out both get plenty of attention in this book, so I half liked it.  What title and subtitle fail to mention, though—and what saves the book for me—is its depiction of the battle waged by commercial start-up ventures to compete with government-subsidized corporations such as Boeing and Lockheed-Martin for lucrative NASA and Pentagon contracts. It served to remind me that conservative diatribes against bloated governmental inefficiency and in favor of capitalist entrepreneurship are at least partly grounded in reality."

These men truly are explorers, as Branson nearly died in a harrowing, transatlantic hot air balloon journey when he and his co-pilot were forced to jump out of the balloon into rough waters near Scotland. He became the first to complete the journey. Bezos experienced a similar run-in with death in his helicopter tour of ranches in west Texas when searching for land to use for Blue Origins. The dichotomy in styles between the ""head down, plow through the line"" of Musk and the self-proclaimed tortoise in Bezos is fascinating, especially since both have achieved the incredible milestone of landing rockets that were launched into space."
84,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399818-zacaro-caro,5,"This book is mostly about Space X. I think Boeing and Lockheed should have had a larger section, their own chapters each before they merged and more of their role in current space exploration as they have a much longer history. I can see why Blue Origin isn’t featured much as they are clearly more secretive. Though almost nothing of Virgin stands out in my memory almost 4 months after reading this and finally getting around to writing a review. But, I didn’t really care about the other companies too much I mostly wanted an Elon Musk story and this book delivers! It makes for a good narrative to have a competitive story, and maybe there is a truly competitive narrative. But it reminds me of Edison and Tesla; Leonardo and Michelangelo—Where the real rivalry was amplified by the media. It’s a good book, and if you are an Elon fan, this book is a fun one."

As someone that admires and has a lot of respect for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, this book taught me even more things about them that I had never heard anywhere else. The author is clearly a great Musk fan, just like myself. It was really interesting to read how the competition between Musk and Bezos is fueling the new space race. They have a complete different perspective on the future of space and their companies’ mottos can clearly show that. SpaceX is all about doing everything fast and learning while doing it, while Blue Origin has a lot more patience and is a very secretive company. If you like Elon, Bezos or Branson and want to understand their passion for space and how they started their companies, this book is a must-read! 5 stars!"

So, hats off to Davenport narrating this.However, I only give 4stars because most of the book is concentrated on Bezos and Musk. I was expecting more stories on other space ventures that are being founded and making good strides around the globe."

Of course I had heard of SpaceX and watched the YouTube videos, I had heard of Virgin Galactic, but am ashamed to say that I had no idea about Blue Origin and Jeff Bezo's role in the race. The race is on, the setbacks have been real, the costs have been high but progress is being made. It is a fascinating read, especially the differences between the billionaires and their methods. It makes you wonder what benefit there might be in joining forces versus the role of the competition. So many resources, so many ideas. Should there be more collaboration?I recommend reading this, learning more, and look forward to a part II in a couple of years. "

We're still in the early stages, and none of the titular Space Barons have done it yet, but commercial-fueled manned space operations are coming, and you have a few colorful personalities to thank for that. This book is a quick summary of the short history of the rise of the space. Focusing less on the personalities (unlike, say, Ashlee Vance's Musk bio) and more on the enterprises, it's a good and fast enough read.I needed it to remember that Paul Allen is still interested in space. Even if no one hears much about him anymore."

Musk is the big talker who has endured some well reported and spectacular failures with his space endeavour SpaceX, as well as of course some incredible success.Bezos' motto is Gradatim Ferociter - Step by step, ferociously - and the animal he identifies with, and is on his coat of arms, is the turtle. His other saying is ""slow is smooth and smooth is fast"". His company Blue Origins stays out of the spotlight.The book is a thorough and entertaining description of the space race as it is today - a commercial, competitive enterprise fuelled by the financial success of a few."

It ends up being a limited biography of Elon Musk (SpaceX/Tesla Inc.), Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin/Amazon.com) and Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic) with honorable mention to those who attempted to start a non-governmental space program. It's rather exciting and the developments are ongoing. Any modesty issues? Direct quotes include the F-word... perhaps 3 or 4 times. Any other problems? The narrative was repetitive in a couple of places. Nothing serious. It seems the author was attempting to reorient the reader. I was not disoriented, but I can see how some people who are coming at this information cold would need some reinforcement.I'll read this book again for sure."

Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Richard Branson and the late Paul Allen have been working to bring space exploration to the everyday person. Traveling into space has been likened to traveling on an airplane, at first it begins as a venture and opportunity for the elites, but then becomes economical and for everyone at an exponential pace, is it the same for space? This book brings up the question of whether or not we should begin to consider privatizing space exploration, particularly since private ventures seem to be working at a much quicker and more efficient pace than NASA. This book is for you if you’ve ever been curious about the likeliness of us being in space in our lifetimes."

Remember Shelly's Monster, turns out connecting bits of people together and getting them to work is a lot harder than thought. This goes for spaceships, how many mad scientists have built spaceships in their back yard and flown them have made TV or film. So it seems spaceships actually need $billions spent on them and teams of thousands over decades to actually get somewhere. Such is the nature of the world. The book is a potted history of what has been the reality of this dream. A bit mechanical in its delivery and without it lays out the story. Readable but lacks excitement!"

I found this book very easy to understand, although I'm not an engineer or space buff. This book is also a great companion to the current National Geographic series, ""Mars"". Blue Origin itself tends to be a secretive company, so reading this book was almost like a backstage pass to their current space endeavors. I found all the information to be current as this book was published April 2018. If you are interested in getting some information about where we stand globally in becoming a multi-planetary species, this is a great jumping off point."

Davenport did some great research into the history of the privatization of space access and along with Musk and Bezos he touches on other space entrepreneurs such as Rutan, Branson, and Allen. This is definitely not a fast paced book but it is well written and kept my attention thanks to my interest in the ongoing development of new space flight technologies and in the swing towards the privatization of space flight in the future.

It is a good read which flows well and gives a good understanding of the environment in which the likes of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic started the process of revolutionising space travel.While this is still an ongoing process, the book does a great job of pointing out how each company managed to carve some space for itself in the over regulated, cost plus environment that has characterised space travel until the early 2000s."

Instead this was a pleasant documentary about the birth of the private space industry. The author is clearly in awe of the subjects and I would have preferred a more unbiased work.The biggest wish that I have would be a 'live update' discussing ""Where are they now?"".

If you removed all the purple prose and meaningless quotes the book would easily be a third shorter. It is routine for the author to present the facts of an event (say a Space X success for example) then provide 2-4 similes or metaphors about it (explaining how great it was to be successful) then provide a quote about the success that adds nothing (like Musk saying ""it was tough but nice to succeed""). This pattern or riffs on it continuously repeat throughout the entire book. I stuck with it because the topic is so interesting, but there has got to be a better book for the same info."

Both Jeff’s and Elon’s bios have some good sections and cover more of the personal element. The Space Barrens makes sure to cover all the major players as a head to head dog fight similar to tech companies fighting for market space - prime example being Google vs Apple vs Blackberry back in the early days. This book has a lot of the same elements as Rocket Men had with covering the Apollo missions. Rocket Men is still my favourite book about space with The Case For Mars as a close second. This is easily in the top three.

Crazy.'. Anyhow I found the details about the company progress thrilling, and I really liked the information on the 'rivalry' and the different approaches to space (summed up in a cutesy tortoise and hare story). Anyhow keep on keeping on. Soon it sounds like I will have the decision on whether I want to spend 200k on a down payment on a west coast USA house, or just go to space for 12 minutes. "

I also didn't know SpaceX came before Tesla, so I definitely learned something after reading it. Plus, the book finally educated me on how the private space companies make money to stay in business, and how they stay in business is via satellite launches for other private companies and governments, they get government contract money, and they charge people to someday fly to space in the future."

It details the history of billionaires who have formed rocket companies, including Bezos, Elon Musk, Richard Branson and more. I loved reading about how Musk dealt with so many rocket failures and how Bezos sailed to the Bermuda Triangle to recover Apollo 11 engines. It’s funny that these billionaires are basically the little guys who taught themselves rocket science and challenged the government for a chance at a space contract. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years, since SpaceX or Blue Origins has yet to transport any humans. "

We live in an exciting time in human history, on the cusp of exploration unlike anything we've experienced before and it's all the more fascinating that these opportunities are being ushered in by billionaires effectively playing with bigger and bigger toys. Regardless of how you feel about Bezos or Musk, this book is well worth the read to build excitement at the thought of humanity reaching for the stars and actually making progress."

The tortoise and hare metaphor is inappropriate and critical analysis of what the separate companies are doing is lacking. "
113,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18900760-orest,4,"Great insights into the history of high-profile billionaires pursing their dreams and spending their money on rockets. Would have been nice if he contrasted their pursuits with the likes of Bill Gates and his pursuit to make a better world by donating much of his fortune to charity. A little repetitive at times. Also, largely avoids telling the stories of non-billionaire run private companies pursing space exploration (like Orbital Sciences). But overall an entertaining read."
114,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6251840-andrew-hyde,4,An illuminating ride through the first 15 years of the private sector debut in outer space. It is at once a good insight into the personalities with an appropriate dollop of technical information to ground the reader’s understanding of the significance of the accomplishments and progress made by the space entrepreneurs or main protagonists. It could have benefited by some international perspective on what is happening in other countries. 
115,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,3,"Pretty fun, I learned a lot about Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, and there were a few early SpaceX stories I wasn't familiar with. Davenport is a journalist, so much of these stories are just a first draft of history. But there's so much more to SpaceX than is addressed here... It's a healthy and humbling reminder that, for any history that I read on any subject matter, I'm only ever getting to scratch the surface of what was really going on."
116,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38657236-robert-rich,4,"Nice account of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Richard Branson and their individual journeys to start companies intent on building rockets and colonizing Mars, establishing interplanetary cargo routes and doing all kinds of other crazy stuff. The story isn’t even close to finished, as there’s still a ton of work to do, but this book serves as a nice part one that can be expanded upon as the companies continue their work. "
117,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8643850-john,4,"I really liked this book about Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and Paul Allen. One of them, if not all, are going to change our lives in the future. Musk and Bezos are fanatics about space and are both plowing their own money into their companies. Bezos is using only his money from Amazon and Musk started using his own money but now has millions in contracts. I can’t wait to see their rockets start putting people into space"
118,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24753563-pablo,4," Engaging romp through the world of billionaire space moguls. Good overview of these new space entrepreneurs and the business of space in general. Hard not to be somewhat awestruck by these huge, larger than life maverick personalities as they dream, brag, argue, pontificate, and shoot rockets into the upper stratosphere. Liked Vance's Musk biogreaphy more, but this was still hugely informative. Fun book - 4 stars"
119,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52137000-robin,4,"It was a pretty good read, divided well between the different billionaires quest to go into space.The theme of the book is pretty much the tortoise (bezos) vs the hair (musk) and at the end of the book you will be rooting for both and agree that both methods have merit. While they can be snarky at each other once in a while, overall it's good that they have the competition of each other.Hopefully a moon-city will start to happen in the next few decades."

""The problem with governments and monopolies is that I don't literally own my own country!"" At least Besos has a twisted kind of class with the whole Lex Luthor thing he's going for. Great quote from the book tho: ""From the Mayflower, to Manifest Destiny, to the Moon."" Yeah, man, exactly. Isn't it about time for this shit to end? "
121,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7479789-luke-ldh,4,"An excellent chronicle of the still-unfolding New Space Age. I do wish to see the day when space travel becomes as routine as taking flight today. To have a chance to see, with my own eyes, that curvature of this beautiful Earth and feel the fragility of the blue veil that has provided sustenance for all those who ever was, ever is but hopefully not ever will be. To think about the possibility that civilizations can achieve at the infinite frontier, it is inspirational. "
122,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90658451-nirali-zzaveri,5,"An absolutely inspiring read that showcased the power of vision, grit and private will. Competing in a space that has been the domain of countries and fiscal spend took an immense paradigm shift over decades that was challenging even for billionaires. It goes to show that we all tackle problems and challenges within the constraints of our resources - grit is never irrelevant, even if you Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk. "

It made me yearn for the stars because it made me truly believe that new Moon landings and even Mars landings are coming, and coming soon. Through little stories and vignettes, I felt like I was becoming familiar with not just the companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic) but also the humans behind them. This is a truly *stellar* book, and I would recommend it to anyone."

With being in the midst of such an incredible time regarding space exploration, this book does an excellent job of describing the three private companies that are at the forefront of this revolution. Davenport does a great job at interweaving the past with the present and mentioning the right stories to put a point across. Mostly highlighting Blue Origin and SpaceX, I feel more informed and excited about accessibility to space than ever before. "

Relevant, interesting, reveals things I didn't know about Bezos' plans for space as well as how NASA and the commercial space race interact. This is the kind of book every independent movie producer should be gunning for the rights to so you can have your crack at today's Apollo 13.

Admittedly, I am a bit of a space geek, but I don’t think you have to be to enjoy this. The new space race competition by 21st century billionaires is fascinating and exciting. The writing was very good, the pace was perfect."
127,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440402-larry,5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not so heavy on the science behind the quest. A brief biography on how a few billionaires put the figurative rocket up the USA space program (or lack thereof) and opened the door for the privatization of space travel. Certainly has put each launch to the space station into perspective.

Narrative nonfiction style, it takes you through SpaceX, Blue Origin and ULA and the incredible differences between these companies. I liked Bezos, but I am enamored with Musk’s brazenness. Enjoyable but without specifics of rocket building!"
130,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17493541-sharon,5,"Fantastic, readable history about the billionaires who are trying to commercialize space travel, with a special focus on Bezos.

131,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63378156-curt-evoy,4,"A well researched book telling the recent history of the commercial space business. The leaders of this new enterprise are Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Paul Allen and Richard Branson. They take different paths to lead their business to the edge of space. The book showed that the new space age is taking place now because of these companies and the visions of their owners. "
132,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75236090-joseph,5,"A brief look inside the lives of modern pioneers of the final frontier. The author takes us behind the scenes at two of the newest and largest space exploration companies. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in space exploration, as well as those readers who want to learn more about the lives of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos."
133,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343650-mike,3,Interesting comparison between the major players who are rebreathing life into humanities long stagnant space program. Focusing on the personalities and personal stories as much as their individual achievements the book adds a lot of flavor and background to this race we are currently watching towards commercial space travel and ultimately the colonization of Mars. 
134,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53337413-mg,3,I'm a huge Elon fan but as a book this was poorly structured/organized. Certain areas in the 2nd half of the book became repetitive as well. Other than that it's interesting if you can overlook those things. The author put a huge emphasis on SpaceX compared to the other private space ventures (e.g. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic) as well.
135,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87803312-shim,4,"Easy, enjoyable read. Learned some interesting tidbits about the various people working on the commercial space industry. It's interesting to compare the different approaches especially Bezos vs Musk. And it's amazing at all that anyone even ventures into the commercial space industry. It's still very much in its infancy, and it's incredible to be living in the midst of it. "
136,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52786853-victor-valore,5,"Consice, specific, story telling. Davenports book is a fast paced review of the new space age, which already is coming to the end of it's second decade. It shares what actually happened, while also looking behind the reasons of those funding it. It tells about government, NASA and personalities. Highly recommendable!."

Who knew that after so many years, the US has not been back up to space to see what is beyond the Moon? Between Bezos, Musk, Branson, and other private companies, the race to colonize Space, the ""Final Frontier"" will be enjoyable to see for many years to come!"

139,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20366831-stephen,3,"A little bit about each of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, with a heavy emphasis on Elon Musk. As reviewer JG summed up nicely: ""This was fascinating, but I'm not sure why it's called Space Baron*S*. The author came across as a huge fan of Elon Musk; I would guess at least 80% of the book is about Musk and SpaceX."""

But I couldn't stop thinking about how if any (or better, all) of these rich a--holes wanted to, they could have spent tens of millions of dollars on eliminating measles or figuring out fusion power or preserving millions of acres of sensitive ecosystems. But they didn't, so now we have competing rocket companies."

This is an interesting read after Musk's biography, tells the modern history of space travel. It's mostly about Musk & SpaceX and Bezos & Blue origin, but also mentions Branson & Virgin, and maybe others... It's amazing how now companies are doing what countries used to do."
142,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68022124-steve-lee,4,An interesting read. It focuses more on the personalities of the main protagonists and skimps over much of the technical stuff and fine details of the aspirations. I was also hoping for something about the start ups targeting the asteroid/lunar resources but I guess that's material for another book. 
143,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114838798-remus-can,0,"A great story of ""the Tortoise and the Hare"". The author calls Elon Musk the hare: “Head down.

There are also stories of other billionaires in the space industry, like Richard Branson, Andy Beal, Burt Rutan; but the book mainly focuses on the competition between SpaceX and Blue Origin."

However, with the timing of the Space X launch it did a good job of giving me some background and answering some basic questions regarding how these deals came to be.

230,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67579991-jay-pruitt,3,"More than just Musk & Bezos, this book covers all the entrepreneurs trying to fill the gap left when NASA 'scuttled the shuttle'. I felt the book bounced around a bit and it had a hard time holding my attention. But this is a fascinating subject - talk about big-huevos gamblers (Bezos, Musk, Branson), these guys really rolled the dice, massive egos and chutzpah. I became intrigued when touring for the first time the NASA facilities in Houston early last year. By pure luck, we were in the control room when the Space X Dragon (Musk) was docked with the Int'l Space Station and delivering supplies. You could tell the NASA Control Team was both laser focused on the mission and elated to be back in the game. In the book there is much discussion of how these efforts came about, attempts and failures at reaching orbit and (more particularly) landing re-usable rockets, and plans to return to the moon and go to Mars.

And so it begins where nations have sidestepped and where cultural interest has waned, the billionaires come out to rekindle our interest in the stars. Space Barons offers a colorful examination of the personalities at play in the final frontier; the children who came of age during yesteryear's shining moments, the nerds who grew up on science fiction (Star Wars, Star Trek, and Verne) and the businessmen who have done everything else. Parts of their journey are necessary. How are we to succeed when the governments keep awarding cronies instead of technological advancements? And parts of their journey are frivolous. But jobs are created, interest is taking over, and the next generation of space leaders are here. What a time to be alive. "

242,1610398297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9457718-evan,0,"""Cost drove lots of decisions, even how the company would build its rockets. Although some companies assembled their rockets vertically on the pad, that required what was known as a mobile service tower. They were giant structures that would surround the rocket while it was being built and then get wheeled away. 'Elon was like, ""That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of ever...Like, how expensive is that?""' ... The [Falcon 9] rocket's avionics were powered by a $5,000 computer instead of the much more expensive aerospace hardware. One employee even found a piece of metal in a junkyard that he thought might be used as part of the rocket's fairing, the protective cone on the top of the rocket that shields the payload, such as a satellite. Instead of using the straps that came with the module used for storing cargo, which NASA's astronauts on the space station apparently found cumbersome, they found straps using a NASCAR design that the astronauts loved. SpaceX even questioned the kinds of latches that were used in the lockers of the space station. Each locker required two latches, which each cost $1,500 and had twenty to twenty-five parts. At 'SpaceX, we weren't going to build that,' recalled John Couluris, of SpaceX mission operations. 'One engineer was inspired—I think it was honestly in the men's room—where he saw the latch on a stall, and we were able to make a locking mechanism out of that.' Instead of $1,500, it cost $30. 'It's more reliable, and it's easier to replace if it ever goes bad. The astronauts, not only did they love it, but they loved the story behind it because that shows the ingenuity.'"""
