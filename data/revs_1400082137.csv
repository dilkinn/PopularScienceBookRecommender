0,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"It is interesting that I read this book concurrently with Joan Didion’s A Year of Magical Thinking, wherein her daughter nearly succumbs to sepsis created by the flu. I remember reading through those chapters and thinking, “my god this still happens!” I know  factually  that people still die from sepsis from bacteria and viruses; my childhood hero, Jim Henson passed in that same manner with pneumonia. I even know, logically, that this CAN happen to people in their prime- recently a local police officer passed from the flu. These things happen, all over the place, and all the time, but now it’s rare enough its reported. I know these things logically, but I do not know them emotionally because this type of loss has been incredibly rare for everyone born after the “discovery/invention” of sulfa medicines and the rebirth of medicine that it spawned. People used to understand that a simple disease could suddenly take control of your body. A measly eighty years ago no one was untouched by that sort of death.My own father has a scar on his neck where the doctors had to cut in to treat a severe staph infection he received in the nursery at the hospital. Years later, another baby, born the same day as him, died from a staph infection kept in the same nursery he had been. He said it always gave him the chills to think about. Yet childbirth was one of the first near death experiences that almost everyone faced. It’s a wonder that Freud never looked into that (or maybe he did), we came into the world potentially blinded from gonorrhea, weakened and defenseless against strep, staph, childbed fever, a simple cold, tuberculosis. Name it. Every baby born in a hospital before sulfa and semi-modern hygiene practices was nearly born one foot in the grave. Labor wards resembled morgues more than today’s thriving delivery wards.This book really makes you appreciate that. It makes you appreciate the staggering amount of human suffering despite doctor’s best (and not always misguided) efforts from medieval times to the early 1900’s. It also makes you appreciate the up-hill battle to understand what was happening in our bodies when we were infected and how to stop it. It makes you appreciate  what you have now .I thought that the author did a fantastic job of weaving interesting side-stories into the narrative. The horrors of WWI that set Domagk on a path to end the curse of infection, made you understand what could drive a man to fail for years, all the while believing that there was something out there that would act as a panacea. There were stories that strengthened the reader’s understanding of the importance of sulfa- it saved Churchill’s life in the middle of the war, it saved thousands and thousands of soldier’s lives during the war, soldiers that had this been WWI, would have just died. He really let you see the world wide impact that it had- it helped form the FDA, it saved hundreds maybe thousands of Africans and Islanders. He brought the humanity back into medicine and let the reader see how the world became so transformed its nearly unrecognizable from then to now. Sure the doctors were catty, and maybe purposely obtuse. The evil of the Nazi’s cannot be overstated. Neither can the fear that many non-Nazi Germans felt within their own country at the time. America’s FDA had a rocky start, and hundreds needed to die before anything managed to get changed because of lobbyists. But it was a good story. And an important one. I definitely recommend it, though be prepared for it to slow down at times."
1,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096417-tyler,2,"The story of sulfa drugs makes for good reading, but the author’s fascination with the scientist behind their discovery turns this book into an un-asked-for defense of the German people’s conduct during the Nazi era. The author’s story is uneven, so I’ll go from the bad to the good. Hager’s book could have been thirty or forty pages shorter. He takes too long describing the experiments leading to the isolation of a sulfa drug by Dr. Gerhard Domagk, who one day would win a Nobel prize for it. He lingers too much over the Great War and wastes too many pages on the rollout of the new drug. The author explains away a shocking scandal in which Domagk’s employer sat on his discovery for two years, and he depicts the Pasteur Institute as a dump whose nihilistic reasearchers were out to destroy the profitability of the German discovery just for the fun of it. Because Hager identifies so much with Dr. Domagk the full story of sulfa loses its way. Dr. Domagk was a German scientist working for a German conglomerate in the runup to World War II, so the author feels it necessary to defend the actions of the German people and even individual Nazis to save his hero from accusations nobody ever made. Hager thus drags out the old tu quoque about the awful things the Americans and Russians did, ruining even that by deploring how invading American troops simply ruined Dr. Domagk’s formal dinner jacket. Are you kidding me? When Domagk’s involvement with sulfa ends, so does Hager’s story. The author, in short, doesn’t say enough about the right things.Still, scientific discoveries are natural stories for human curiosity. Would you like to guess the main causes of hospital deaths in 1930? If you were born after that time, you probably have no idea. Hager does a good job framing the state of medical science which drove the search for chemical antibiotics. A skillful juxtaposition of the lives of the sons of two American presidents illustrates two separate worlds, a world of terror at the prospect of infections of any kind, followed by a glorious new world brought about by sulfa in which any illness seemed curable. It’s here that Hager does his best work, helping to remind us of a time sulfa allowed us to forget about in the astonishing space of a single year.I rated this book just an “okay” read because the weaknesses outweigh the strengths and the final chapter is a cut-and-paste job with no value for readers. But the story of sulfa is fascinating, and if you’re interested (and you should be) you may well find it worthwhile to plow through the annoying parts of the story for the sake of the better ones."
2,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"~4.5Even as late as the 1930s, an infection was a likely death sentence. Even a small wound on a finger or toe could be deadly, for if it became septic, doctors could do nothing except hope that the patient could fight off the infection. Antibiotics were only a wistful dream of a universal panacea. After all, how could one create a medicine that would unerringly target the bacterial foe while leaving all of the diverse cells of the body intact?Everything changed with the invention of sulfa. Sulfanilamide, or sulfa, which is still used today in familiar drugs such as Bactrim, was the first widely-known antibiotic, its effectiveness discovered by the German pathologist Gerhard Domagk. The story of sulfa--its invention, the race to production, the ironic twist in its usage, the growing tensions between Germany and the rest of the world--is all utterly fascinating and probably obscure to most of us. Because of that, I won’t describe the best parts of the story--it’s far better to reach the delicious ironies unaware. Hager is a fantastic storyteller. He weaves together the story of sulfa from a series of related episodes, digressing into everything from Domagk’s war experiences to the disastrous patent medicine incident in the United States to the French techniques of corporate espionage to the sulfa experiments on the women of Ravensbruck, yet somehow creating a harmonious whole. My only real complaint is that these digressions tend to make the book jump around a lot in time so that I had difficulty reconstructing the chronology.Hager packs a tremendous amount of history into the story, and the impact of these practically forgotten figures is utterly startling. Many of these stories, such as the lab assistant who accidentally inoculated himself with “super strep” and was forced to experiment with his own treatments-- are so fantastic and so perfectly fitting that it is hard to believe they are fact rather than fiction. The stories of the characters' war experiences are so dramatic that I had to double-check them before I could believe the text. Oddly, one extraneous detail that really stuck with me was an offhanded comment about Hitler's vehement dislike of animal testing. How could a man who outlawed animal testing be so ready to substitute them with humans? I know Hitler was a monster and that much of what he did was even more illogical, but that bizarre inconsistency still somehow continues to trouble me. One of my favourites from the beginning of the book is the story of childbed fever, a.k.a. “The Doctor’s Plague.” First seen in the 1600s, it took centuries of dead women before people began to notice an odd pattern. While doctors’ patients tended to die in droves, those treated by midwives, even in the same hospitals, had a good chance of never catching the disease. It took even longer for someone to discover the moral of the story: if you’ve just finished an autopsy of one victim of childbed fever, it might be nice to wash your hands before sticking them up another. If you have even a mild interest in medical history, then I’d definitely recommend taking a look at The Demon in the Microscope. There’s nothing quite as magical as a gifted storyteller with a fascinating story to tell."
3,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2698100-blake-charlton,5,"One of the best examples of clear, compelling scientific writing I've ever come across. Though I've studied organic chemistry and medical science for years, I never knew the amazing impact of sulfa--ranging from transformation of the medical profession, to the great influence it had on the way WWII was fought, to the creation of the FDA. Anyone interested in good science or historical writing really should pick this one up. For those interested in medicine, pharmacology, and infectious disease, this book is mandatory reading!"
4,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998036-meg,4,"Let me start by saying the title of this book is incredibly misleading. This is not one doctor's discovery of sulfa drugs, the first antibiotic, it is the story of the discovery of sulfa drugs and their effectiveness which took years and many people in labs throughout several countries. The focus for much of the book is on Gerhard Domagk, but there were dozens instrumental to its discovery, development, and marketing; not to mention those who paved the way for the research.The book covers the development, use, and eventual disuse of sulfa drugs from 1931 to 1950, covering WWI and WWII and the horrific battlefield wounds found there. I learned so many things from this book, I'll just touch upon a few subjects. First would be the sheer destructive power of what we consider minor ailments today. An infected cut, especially a battlefield injury full of shrapnel and manure rich soil, would almost inevitably kill, often in horrible ways such as gas gangrene. Strep throat and ear infections were much the same, all families and doctors could really do was make them comfortable and hope.There is a history of understanding bacteria and diseases. Without an understanding of what caused them, doctors would often spread infections and disease to otherwise healthy patients. This is illustrated with childbed fever, doctors would attend autopsies and immediately after examine living patients with no break for washing. One doctor was even known to carry interesting specimens from autopsies in his pocket.Interestingly, once sulfa was proved to work it was immediately over-prescribed and over ingested for everything from colds and fevers (which it was ineffective against) to meningitis and infections (which it was very effective against). Everyone wanted sulfa and it was eaten like candy. This overuse helped create the first strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria, a problem which is huge today. Not to mention all the patent medicines that misused it and ended up poisoning people which lead to the creation of the FDA and gave it the power to enforce drug testing.I was also fascinated to discover that Hitler was extremely against animal testing but, after the death of one of his favorites, endorsed human testing on women imprisoned at Ravensbruck. These women were infected with various forms of strep bacteria and given various levels of sulfa to see how effective it was. (This was after sulfa was conclusively proven to fight strep bacteria in Germany, France, England, the United States, and several other countries)Overall I have been given a new sense of gratitude to live in an era of antibiotics. This is a gripping history of the development of medicines and they changed medical practice, research, and even livestock."
5,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The one man is  Gerhard Domagk, but there is so much more. Domagk's story, while integral, is just one part. He was undoubtedly dogged, as evidenced by 5 years of amazingly precise & thorough testing, especially for the times. He was a great man as we find out at toward the end. Not only did he stand up to the Nazis, but he warned against antibiotic resistance early.Hager does a great job of tracing medicine from well before & into the 1950s. He focuses on Sulfa & its wild story from an outgrowth of an industrial dye complex to patent medicines in the US, through crazy patenting issues, & almost unbelievable testing & use until it was outshone by penicillin, but it didn't appear in a vacuum. There was a lot going on in the world including World Wars & overturning medicine as a whole. That's the real story here. I was very surprised by how precise the early chemists could be in creating new molecules. I was equally shocked by the lack of testing of medicines. When they were tested, it was the poor, the 'lost' cases, & military that were in the front lines, if it wasn't the scientist or his family. Medical ethics of the day were incredible.Very well narrated. While Hager was occasionally repetitive, he often needed to be to draw various threads together. In the last chapter, he summarizes the book & threads. I appreciated that. It was a long, wonderful trip. Highly recommended not just for the medical history, but for all else that was included. "
6,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,2,"I tend to like medical thrillers, then to I like nonfiction about medical breakthroughs and medical advances. This book does lay out a story but it gets sidetracked from its given premise. We are told we'll be looking at the development of Sulfa and it's effect on medicine and bacterial disease. We do but in a very round about way. The book turns into a series of short biographies. These don't actually hold up well (at least for me) as they to tended to wander a bit.Just me of course but I didn't really get into this book at all. For me it was a put aside and forget book. I'd put off getting back to it. See what you think. Many readers liked it. I suppose it could be that it simply didn't catch my interest. Maybe try this one yourself."
7,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"This is a really excellent book that taught me so much I didn't know.I never knew how important sulfa drugs were in the history of antibacterials. I had always assumed that penicillin was the first successful antibacterial drug, but it appears that sulfa drugs had a much earlier impact. Also, even though penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming, nothing came of his discovery until Florey and Chain produced it on a mass scale. Florey and Chain deserve much greater credit than Fleming does.But this book doesn't really go into that story so much. Instead, it focuses on the development of Sulfa drugs and the tragic life of its discoverer (like the incredible story of his journey to get his Nobel Prize). It does a great job describing the race for different producers to come up with variant designs, some of which were even better than Domagk's original design.There's a real lesson here about how medical innovation operates. Taken together with the Elixir incident covered in the later chapters, it also shows how delicate the balance between too much and too little regulation of drugs. It leaves one to wonder whether a stricter FDA would have prevented the Elixir poisoning, but would also have stopped or slowed down the rapid innovation of the other sulfa compounds, leaving Domagk's inferior molecule as the only established safe option, which didn't work as well for syphilis, for example. And that doesn't even consider the effect of patent law on this question.It's not a question Hager discusses too much in this book, but reading the story in such detail gives you enough facts to think about the positive and negative impact of patent law and regulation upon the medical industry and drug innovation."
8,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"This was an excellent history of the development of the sulfa drugs in the period between the two World Wars. These were the first chemicals developed to cure infections in humans and they started a huge antibiotic industry. It focuses primarily on the German researcher Gerhard Domagk, but also makes very clear how very many different people were involved in the enterprise. It's very well written. Engrossing and entertaining. My only complaint it that it occasionally gets sidetracked onto a side story which is interesting but only tangentially related to the main narrative. But it's a good read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and/or medicine."
9,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,3,"So, for most of my life I read almost exclusively sci-fi. For the past few years, I've been branching out a lot. I'm reading and enjoying more kinds of fiction but also--for the first time in my love--quite a lot of nonfiction. I've read enough historical nonfiction now to sort of understand that the basic task of an author in this genre is to assemble a compelling story from the historical facts. There are basically two approaches.First, they can take a well-known historical story (say, the Fall of Rome) and then offer their own spin. They will tell it from a fresh perspective, or they will offer a contrarian view, or--in rare cases--they will offer the definitive account. (The bigger the event, the harder it is to do that, because so many historians have already done it.)Second, they can take a relatively lesser-known story (say, an American rowing crew preparing for the 1936 Olympics) and in that case they have the advantage of being the only person to tell the story, but the disadvantage of needing to explain why we should care. After all, if the story were really important, wouldn't we have heard it already? When this is done well, it's fantastic. That's why everyone loved The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. When this is not done well, it's often because the author fails to find a way to make their historical event interesting, which is why I gave up on reading The Greatest Game Ever Played. It had promise--especially uncovering the class history of pro vs. amateur competition--but in the end the author just didn't give me any reason to care about golf. In contrast, ""Boys in the Boat"" included enough detail to understand rowing and also enough rowing philosophy--how it relates to fundamental concepts like belonging in a group--that everyone could understand why it mattered.In his book, Hager fell between these two polls. The big, unstated obstacle for his story is that we've all heard of penicillin, but virtually no one has heard of think the ""One Doctor"" is Gerhard Domagk, but I'm not sure, and that's a problem. In fact, a major plot point (even historical books have plots) is the conflict between Domagk (who discovered that sulfa worked) and his chemists (who actually created the first iterations of the wonder drug) and a second is the fact that it was French researches (Domagk and his chemists were working for the German company Bayer) who actually discovered that it was sulfa (and not some other part of the molecule) that actually did the healing work. So the book just isn't framed quite correctly. We start with Domagk and his World War I experiences that provide the psychological underpinning of his desire to cure bacterial infections and we end with him belatedly receiving his Nobel Prize after Germany loses World War II, but in between the thread of the tale is lost under an avalanche of other doctors and scientists--some just as compelling--who contributed as well. We even have long asides into the competitive landscape in which Bayer and other German congolmerates were situated, both nationally and internationally. There are some interesting allegations that Bayer intentionally suppressed part of their discovery (because their initial drug could be patented, but sulfa as a category of drugs could not), but Hager doesn't make any definitive points on that score and so what could be a fascinating historical conspiracy theory becomes just one more loose end cluttering up the landscape.On the other hand, some of the tangents were really interesting. For one thing, Hager talks about a mass poisoning that took place after the advent of sulfa drugs in the US when a patent drug manufacturer (independent and essentially unregulated) used an industrial solvent to dissolve sulfa and shipped the resulting concoction--which was quite lethal--across the country. The resulting deaths and widespread outrage led to the formation of the modern FDA. (The FDA already existed, but not with the kinds of powers it has today.) This is all interesting stuff, but what does it have to do with Gerhard Domagk? Not a thing, really. And even here, the story is told with frequent use of flashbacks that are kind of confusing as you read them. The problem in this case is not that there's not enough to tell a story, but that there's too much and instead of picking and choosing Hager throws it all in there. This works out better than it should, because so many of the parts are interesting. I really liked the analysis of how the meaning and role of a physician's work changed dramatically from a humble comforter (before anti-biotics doctors were basically powerless once an infection took hold) to an arrogant technician (today doctors have a huge number of powerful drugs at their disposal which can have great impact) and the possible negative ramifications for society (we've abandoned a lot of the public health campaigns that, in 1890 - 1930 when germ theory was understood but antibiotics didn't exist yet) were the backbone of public health strategy. In short: the ability to fight infections diverted our attention away from preventing them, and--if prevention is more cost-effective--this might be a bad idea in the long run.So, I definitely recommend the book. It was interesting and I also happened to get lots of ideas for my own writing from it, but it was also a flawed story. Which is understandable. The thing about history is that you are--we all assume and hope--constrained by the facts as they really happened. Hager couldn't just relocate the American patent medicine scare to Germany to make Domagk a central character in that episode. So I've got nothing but respect for his research and his analysis, but in the end the result is still a little too diffuse to be truly gripping."

11,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64441546-john,4,"Interesting read on a history I knew very little about, detailing the rise of antibiotics, the pharmaceutical industry, and the FDA all in the backdrop of WW2. It also blows my mind reading about how common and quickly what we consider as minor bacterial infections like strep throat would kill people. We take a lot for granted."
12,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13118895-amy-kannel,4,"Absolutely loved this. The kind of book I can't stop thinking about and wanting to talk about. Close to 5 stars, but I try to reserve that rating for the very, very best so that it's more meaningful. I'm a huge fan of this type of nonfiction (history, written almost as a novel, crossing various disciplines/topics) and this story in particular was fascinating and satisfying."
13,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"I got sick while in the middle of this book, and it's a testament to the content that I kept reading despite the descriptions of people dying in various agonizing ways while my own health was questionable. It's not that graphic, but for anyone born after a certain time, after antibiotics became both commonplace and safe, it's sobering to realize how many people used to die due to secondary infections.Gerhard Domagk, a German soldier-turned-medical-assistant in the First World War, was frustrated by seeing how many men survived surgery, only to succumb to gangrene days later. The conditions were horrid, but he did his best; ""He was smart, young, and strong, he followed orders and worked hard. He earned a reputation as a reliable, steady man. And he was unusually observant."" I felt like that last line was equivalent to ""And the spider bit Peter"" or something, the sign of a superhero's emergence. (I will note that his uncanny ability to spot four-leaf clovers, which Hager attributes to Domagk's combined observation skills and luck, is something my mom shares, so maybe she has a pending great scientific discovery!)Despite the title, though, this is not just Domagk's story. While he goes on to become a physician, we learn about the rise of the German chemical dye industry, which eventually turns its eye toward pharmaceuticals. The connection's not as tenuous as it may seem; chemists are involved in both, and a man named Paul Ehrlich figures that in the same way some dyes hold fast to some materials better than others, it might be possible to design a chemical that would target specific bacteria.This isn't simple or easy work; consider that ""Number 418"" is one of the first promising chemicals, and that's hundreds of chemicals, each painstakingly tested. Hager also does a fantastic job illustrating how a profit-motivated company has the resources and mixed motivations to discover a working drug. And with their industrial dye origins, the first solution is bound to a dye, and mysteriously only works in live animals, not in test tubes; this mystery is satisfactorily explained. In the end, sulfa, an unpatentable substance, was pinpointed as the acting agent.And Hager doesn't stop there. The following sulfa craze leads to patentable variants, and one of them includes a solvent that, when ingested, leads to kidney failure. As deaths pile up, the FDA springs into action. It doesn't have much clout at this time -- it has to seize the toxic elixir under a technicality of mislabeling rather than because it's actually dangerous. Pharmaceutical companies have gutted any legislation that would back up governmental regulation, until the elixir panic finally pushes through a law with some bite.There's a bit of back-and-forth through different times and places to provide proper context: the emergence of germ theory, the classification of different types of strep by an American lab assistant, the conflict between chemists and researchers and who gets the credit, childbed fever, FDR's son's illness, the hellish Nazi experiments on exactly how effective sulfa could be (you can imagine how they went about this), Hitler's refusal to allow any Germans to accept Nobel Prizes... It's actually rather coherent and added to my interest, but I can see some people getting frustrated with the side details (and I've left out a bunch).This is not a medical thriller or a heart-quickening route to discovery, but it rewards patience and paints an eye-opening picture of not only how much things have changed in medicine, but how, and how it also could -- and did -- go wrong. I see Hager has other books; they're going on my to-read list."
14,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,3," This was a very interesting history of the drug that changed medicine forever. I can’t remember where I read it, but just recently I read a brief description of its discovery. According to that author, a scientist interested only in developing dyes accidentally stumbled on one that would cure infections. This scientist’s daughter has an accident and develops an infection, then against every scientific bone in his body, he gives her the dye and voila she is healed rather to his surprise. While there was a scientist who had a daughter who was saved from at best an amputation through his invention, there is so much more to that story. This author fills in all the missing details. He describes the helplessness of doctors and scientists in the face of every disease. He describes the horrific death tolls from infections in field hospitals and maternity wards. Then he delves into Gerhard Domagk’s decade long search for a cure. He paints a very full picture of the times and the medical research community in Europe. Really, it is the story of the beginning of the modern war on disease.  It all covers the immediate effects this drug had on the medical community, the discoverers, the public, the military, and the political scene.  I suppose if you don’t care the small details of history this book would get a little slow, but I found all those little anecdotes fascinating.  It was very discrete where necessary and I greatly appreciate that. "

If you ever wished to time travel and often picture yourself at Downton Abbey, let this cure you of such romanticism. Life before antibiotics was precarious! If President Calvin Coolidge's son could DIE of a blister on his toe that he got playing tennis, nobody was safe.

19,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2098562-catherine,4,"Tells the story of the life-altering research and development of sulfa drugs. The book is well paced for the most part, and the backdrop of early Nazi Germany adds additional interest. The book begins with the story of Gerhard Domagk, a German who survived injuries sustained in World War I to become the first doctor and researcher to achieve some success in developing an antibiotic. Coverage of the initial research dragged a little (possibly because none of the German or French researchers would listen when I repeatedly hissed, “It’s not the azo dyes!”). It picked up when Daniel Bovet, a Swiss scientist employed by the Pasteur Institute in France, found he had four extra mice to experiment with. By the time Dr. Long of Johns-Hopkins received what he initially believed to be a prank call from a colleague impersonating Eleanor Roosevelt, both the story and the use of sulfa were moving like a wildfire.  I was struck by the fact that only 75 years ago there was no awareness of the importance of hygiene in medical procedures. It was also fascinating to read about problems resulting from nonexistent standards for drug oversight, and how an errant sulfa compound finally changed this.The book goes on to cover further uses and abuses of sulfa variants, politics, and peer competition, particularly as World War II came to an end, and the satisfaction when Domagk was finally allowed to accept his Nobel prize 8 years after it was awarded. By that time penicillin was proving to be more useful than sulfa, but as the epilogue points out (somewhat repetitively), the evolution of the first antibiotic had a profound impact on medical protocol and the health of the world population.

It really took off in America when it saved the President’s son, FDR Jr. Publicity spread about this wonder drug and to meet demands a company out of Tennessee, Massengill Co, made a liquid form in 1937. It was a concoction of Elixir Sulfanilamide adulterated with a lethal ingredient, diethylene glycol, that had the nasty side effect of killing people, more specifically killing kids then adults in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That lead to a massive hunt by the FDA to track down those who unwittingly were given the poisonous liquid. This catastrophe resulted in strengthening the FDA thru the passage of The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938"" From there on out drugs had to undergo testing before being unleashed on the public. This is just one of Many interesting stories in this book.The narrator, Stephen Hoye, of this 12hrs and 18 min audiobook is about as animated as a stuffed bear. This book would have greatly benefited from a livelier presentation. "
21,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1253638-trena,4,"I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that antibiotics changed the human condition. I had a vague idea about a penicillin eureka moment with moldy bread, but had never heard any of the story of the actual first commercially available antibiotics: sulfa drugs. In inter-war Germany, Bayer gave nearly unlimited budget and time to a team that painstakingly tested hundreds of synthesized chemicals--each patiently constructed a molecule different than the last--against a virulent form of strep developed specifically for the tests. When they finally found one that worked, the rest of the world was highly skeptical, until doctor after doctor found themselves in a last ditch situation with deathly ill patients and managed to wheedle some Prontosil out of Bayer's labs with literally miraculous results.I enjoyed the book's balance between the personalities and the science, and the story really is riveting. It's well-written and moves quickly, ranging from Bayer's labs to a horrifying patent medicine episode in American that killed dozens and led to the evolution of the modern FDA. Great read! "
22,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8371136-miklos,5,"A fantastic book. Hager provides a fascinating history of how sulfa drugs were invented, taking interesting detours along the way. One particular detour sheds light on how the FDA came to be resultant a poisonous sulfa drug elixer made by Massingil. It turns out that the owner of the company was a real douche as well! The book reads like a suspense novel, jumping from Germany to France to England and back as the sulfa drug is discovered. While the Germans bring the first sulfa drug over the finish line, Hager tells the story of how the rest of the world decoded and improved it.The story takes place in one of history's most interesting and volatile periods 1910-1950. This book has it a all: medicine, big corporations, Nazis, rivalries, two world wars, disappointment and triumph."
23,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4907425-pdiver,3,"I read this after reading The Alchemy of Air, also by Thomas Hager. Though both TAoA and this book are thoroughly researched and shed light on very important, and often undervalued, scientific issues, TDUtM distinctly feels stitched together, so much so as to seem forced at times. The book's description is deliberately compelling, and in many ways, the theme of the story is very much deservedly so. However, Hager seems to lose steam at certain parts of the book, filling pages with anecdotes that encumber the story rather than enhance. If deciding between these two Hager books, both with similar historical settings, definitely choose Alchemy first. You are likely to move to Demon next, but the reverse sequence is unlikely to be seen to completion. "
24,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1423386-suzanne,5,I love drug discovery stories and this one goes beyond the initial discovery to tell you about what was going on in the world of medicine and how the discovery changed things today. Excellent.
25,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69494865-miri-niedrauer,4,"I picked up this book to procrastinate from writing my PhD dissertation on antimicrobial chemistry, justifying to myself that it sort of qualified as background research. Everyone has heard the story of Penicillin's discovery, but much of the information presented here was new even to me despite working in the field. The discovery of Sulfa's antibacterial properties largely changed the opinions of the public regarding science-based medicine and also played a big part in creating government-regulation of medicines, saving hundreds of thousands of live (if not more) and eliminating unimaginable amounts of suffering. Who can say how long it may have taken society to accept these concepts under different circumstances. The author also does an excellent job of accurately portraying the hair-pulling frustrations involved with medicinal chemistry/drug design, which sadly have really not progressed all that far over the past century. "
26,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925186-bill,3,"Lots of fascinating history interwoven with some pretty boring research. It felt like the author wanted to make an entire book focused on sulfa, but tried to cover way too much ground. Certain chapters told an engaging story about an individual and those worked really well. But too many chapters were obviously based on corporate notes from Bayer and were fairly boring. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't get the sense he was rationalizing the German researchers' actions and I actually thought it was interesting to hear what life was like for a normal German during the war. Until I just saw the full title, I forgot this book was supposed to be focused on one person. It doesn't really do that. I would probably recommend better books on the subject."

He describes the search for medicines, the reason behind each researchers desire to find a cure, and links all of those who contributed to finding sulfa based drugs.He also touches breifly on current antibiotics and how super bugs are developing.He does jump around in time, which I did find a little confusing. It always took a moment to figure out what time he was now in. Indid listen to this on audio which may have made it more difficult."

Many books about scientific discoveries and science history attempt to tie the discovery to modern advancements. This book artfully connects that discovery of sulfa not only to advances in modern medicine, but also changes in the process of scientific discovery, political history, bureaucratic development, and ethical problems. I was impressed with how well the author tied together personal and public histories to provide a thorough and complex examination of the first antibiotic."

It vividly shows how fragile life was before the invention of modern medicine, and how governments (and warfare) affect what scientists focus their efforts on. This book also shows how interconnected the world is, at least since the 20th century. German scientists discovering molecules indirectly leads to the USA passing stronger FDA regulations ... talk about unexpected consequences!"
36,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7723314-steven,5,"Fascinating history, not just of the sulfa drugs, but of the remaking of modern medicine for better (turning doctors from poorly paid people that could only predict and console into the practical scientists they are today) and for worse (human trial research methods being pioneered in nazi death camps, the rise of giant pharmaceutical companies that now have a stranglehold on the industry).Not only this, but there are some amazing biographical stories as well that will stick with you. For me, the story of doctor that first made the connection that doctors were making people sick by performing autopsies and then treating patients really stood out, even though it was a pretty minor part of the book. He got the other doctors at his hospital to start taking some basic sanitary precautions, saving thousands of lives. However, the realization that he had personally caused the deaths of many patients (his patients were all mothers who had just given birth) sent him into a deep depression that led to being put into a mental hospital as a patient himself, where he contracted an infection and died. He had made this revolutionary discovery (he doesn't get much credit in history because he hadn't identified the culprit, just the problem), but because he couldn't forgive his own ignorance, rather than thinking about the exponential effects his discovery would have, he dwelled on the past that he could not change. Thus, the world was also deprived of future discoveries he may have made earlier than anyone else, which could have saved so many more lives.As I said, that's just one relatively minor part of the story, and seeing these doctors' and researchers' stories at a turning point in modern medicine, not to mention world history (the rise of the third reich), was a fascinating journey. "
37,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008948-tim,4,"I picked this at random off the shelf of the library. Like other good histories, some of the side stories are as interesting as the main story. For example, when sulfa caught on in the United States, unregulated patent medicine companies were still a thing. One such company, Massengill seized on the demand for sulfa and made their own brew using diethylene glycol. This killed nearly 100 people and helped pass the landmark Food and Drug act of 1938 that required that drugs are proven safe before they are sold. The author takes a story that can be told in a single sentence: ""People used to die of strep infections and then scientists found sulfa could cure strep."" He takes that sentence and zooms in, crops, and zooms in some more until interesting details pop out that illuminate medicine, politics, business, and especially World War Two.Sometimes he zooms in too much. For example, I didn't gain much insight from reading a drawn out sequence about a scientist having trouble getting permission to travel from Germany to Sweden. "
38,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11881873-charlotta-norby,5,"A totally fascinating book. Very readable by the lay reader. About how chemists and physicians discovered the first anti-bacterial, anti-biotic drugs, and forever changed the course of medicine, and all kinds of other things. It's a fascinating view of how quickly these developments have taken place - less than 100 years ago, most doctors didn't attend medical school, there was no such thing as control by prescription of the distribution of drugs to patients. There were no requirements that in order to manufacture, advertise, and sell drugs, pharmaceutical companies, druggists, or pharmacies prove that the drugs cured anything or had any beneficial effects at all, or even that they were at all safe. Doctors could do very little for sick people; basically just provide comfort as they watched them die.All that changed, as a result of the discovery of the ability of sulfa drugs to cure certain - but not all - diseases caused by bacteria. "
39,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7453053-shaun,5,"Excellent. A really compelling story and well written. The thing I loved most about this book is how it prefaced so many of the trends we take for granted now about drug regulation and drug discovery. The author was effective at conveying the magnitude of the discovery - it is simply unimiganible to me that people 100 years ago lived in a world where strep throat was often fatal and women were so likely to die after childbirth from infection. My only wish was that the author would have delved a little more into the chemistry/biology of the drugs being discussed. There were small glimpses (e.g., the discussion of how sulfa blocks the production of folate in bacteria), but much of the chemistry was glossed over (e.g., ""the researchers tinkered some more with the compound, adding side chains until they found X that was effective""). Nevertheless, the magnitude of the discovery and the tumultuous circumstances of WW2 make this story (and the author's telling of it) a must read."
40,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64255309-noel,4,"Discovered almost accidentally by German scientists, the Sulfa class of antibiotics was one of the first modern (and effective) means of combating the ills that plagued mankind for eons prior to its arrival. In a Bayer laboratory, a team of chemists and researchers, more suited to continuing to pump out the dyes that made its company a landmark chemical company, than to creating a miracle cure, happened upon Sulfaprim. Those old enough to remember have my astonishment for living through such a wonderful time, and this tome is written well-enough to capture most of that former age's glory.One aspect of this book that I really loved was how the author began to relate stories that were seeminly unrelated, only to tie them in what would then become an ""only natural"" conclusion.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in microbiology, the history of medicine, or even those who like a sidestory to the trials and tribulation of the WWII era."

I thought it raised an a lot of interesting ethical questions. If you have a new medicine that can save lives, do you throw it out there as quickly as possible to reach people sooner, or spend time testing it to make sure that there aren't unintended consequences? How do you balance the competing needs of providing affordable medicines to the ill & dying, and the companies that need to earn money to pay for research for the next generation of lifesaving medications? How do you go about doing lifesaving research under an immoral regime? All around, this made me appreciate just how world-altering the invention of antibiotics really was. "

I couldn't wait to get back to this book every time I was away.If you like not dying of stupid infections (and you should probably like this), this is a great book to find out why we don't die of stupid infections.

In other words, I am a nerd, and I thought this book was awesome.

49,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57150718-geoff-habiger,5,"Thomas Hager's tale about the discovery of the worlds first true antibiotic is an excellent narrative filled with equal parts drama, medical thriller, human interest, scientific inquiry, and science history. The Demon Under the Microscope primarily focuses on the life and work of a German research doctor, Gerhard Domagk, who, along with talented chemists at Bayer, identified the first drug from a chemical that was effective against a variety of bacteria. The story of sulfa's discovery, and it's impact on the world, is masterfully told by Hager.I learned a lot from Hager's story, not only about Domagk but about the history of the modern pharmaceutical industry. As somebody who has worked for over 17 years in pharmaceutical quality assurance I was very interested to learn about this part of the history of the industry. Sulfa was the first true modern drug, rigorously researched and tested before being released. I was fascinated by many of the connections that Hager weaves together to tell the story of the first miracle drug, and how many seemingly different events all had an impact on not only sulfa's discover, but the revolution in antibiotics and the modern pharmaceutical industry.One part of the story that I most enjoyed was Hager's recounting of the tragic Elixir of Sulfanilamide event. During the early craze over sulfa drug makers - many of them makers of ""patent"" medicines that had almost no testing for safety or effectiveness - made a plethora of sulfa containing drugs. All in the hopes of getting in on the sulfa crazy and earning money. Elixir of Sulfanilamide was a sweet tasting syrup that contained the wonder drug sulfa and was sold over the counter by pharmacists across the United States. The elixir had another component used to dissolve the sulfa (sulfanilamide was notoriously difficult to put into solution and couldn't be dissolved in water) - diethylene glycol. Today we know that diethylene glycol is a very toxic chemical and will attack the kidneys and lead to death. In the 1930's almost nothing was known about this chemical. In the rush to join the sulfa bandwagon the maker of the elixir used a harmful chemical without knowing it. No testing or research was done, and as a result over 100 people in the US were killed. Hager's recounting of the events around the Elixir of Sulfanilamide, and how it related to not only to the history and discovery of sulfa, but also to the evolution of the modern drug regulatory environment, was very well done. (The deaths cause by the elixir spurred the US Congress to pass new laws that gave more oversight and power to the Food and Drug Administration - FDA - effectively changing overnight how drugs were to be manufactured, tested, and sold in the US. In essence I owe my own career in pharmaceutical quality assurance to sulfa and the tragic events of the elixir.)Spanning across decades and tying together not only the research from Germany, France, and England, but also the lives of the researchers and doctors, The Devil Under the Microscope is a compelling narrative about one of the pivotal points in modern history. Had sulfa not been discovered and its benefits been shown to the world the modern antibiotics we have today may still have been discovered, but the process by which new drugs are researched, tested, and brought to market may never have come about. Even though sulfa was soon overshadowed by the end of WWII by penicillin and other antibiotics its discovery was instrumental in paving the way for our modern pharmaceutical industry. Hager's research into the history of sulfa, and the clear and entertaining way that the story of sulfa is delivered to the reader, makes The Demon Under the Microscope a book well worth the read. I listened the the wonderful audiobook version from Tantor media read by Stephen Hoye and downloaded from my local library. Hoye does a great job of narrating the events, bringing the lives of the different characters in the discovery of sulfa to life, and making the pronunciation of so many different tongue-twisting chemical names seem easy and effortless. I highly recommend this book for anybody interested not only in history or the history of science, but for people who are interested in real-life drama and medical mysteries. "
50,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14009857-tran-lam,5,"Very interesting chronicle on various discoveries that eventually led to the discovery of the first antibiotics and how it revolutionized the fields of healthcare and pharmaceutics. 75% of the book is page-turner, and the other 25% was filled with relevant, but unnecessary, side stories that cut the flow of the chapters. The book could have been like 50 pages shorter if there was fewer side stories and sudden unimportant new names (which were hard to remember for me because they were European). Most of the stories took place in Europe during World Wars so it was very interesting to weave scientific development and regional/global politics together into a nuanced story. Summary of the book for myself, so SPOILER ALERT:1. Discoveries: microscope = realization of a world of microorganism; petri dish and the technique of cell culture = allowed scientists to categorize bacteria based on the sickness they could inflict on humans; a methodical approach to trial-and-error chemical testing systems = the discovery of the first antibiotics and many others. 2. Healthcare evolved over time, so did the roles of physicians. Before World War 1, healthcare was all about providing consolation while waiting for miracles to happen. People were dying of bacterial infections all the time and hospitals & armies were one of the most contagious areas to be around. Once bacteria were discovered and categorized, healthcare shifted into disinfecting techniques on the open wounds and sterilization of hospital environments. As different chemicals were found to treat bacterial infections, healthcare shifted into the understanding of their medicinal effects and dosages. 3. Pharmaceutical research also evolved over time. Before, humans placed hope on witchcraft and alchemy to find THE cures for diseases. Then we started finding cures for parasitic diseases and discovered vaccines, but we couldn't cure bacterial infections yet. A lot of effort was put into research of external applications, serum therapy (expensive and not generics), and internal ingestions of chemicals. But the effort was not scalable until Bayer, a chemical company under IG Farben (world's largest chemical cartel in Germany that served the Nazis), developed a system to test hundreds of chemicals on several diseases at once per year. This company came up with commercial drugs for malaria, sleeping sickness, strep, and staph infections by using this system and laid the foundation for global search for hundreds of antibiotics.4. Many Nobel prize winners were from IG Farben. German truly lead the world in scientific discoveries and applications pre-World-War-2.5. First antibiotics = sulfa drugs, which are antimetabolites that prevented bacteria from binding with PABA (a chemical that helped bacteria process nutrients). Discovered in 1932, withdrawn from market entry for 2 years by Bayer due to its unpatentability, then heightened as the miracle cures for lots of infections for 2 decades worldwide, especially during World War 2, and eventually taken off the glory because of growing resistance of the bacteria. Antibiotics resistance is one of the biggest healthcare concern in 21st century. 6. Unregulated production of sulfa drugs led to a series of death in Southern U.S. and provided public support to strengthen the power of FDA in regulating drugs and cosmetics. Before, FDA could only charge companies for mislabeling chemicals' uses to consumers, which placed burden on the government to *prove* that they were falsely advertised. Now, companies have to provide info of ingredients, side effects, and evidence of untoxicity. Sulfa scandals led to rigorous clinical trials (as well as its related industry) and FDA regulations. 7. Before the advent of antibiotics, infections couldn't be cured so prevention was prioritized. Public health's measures were taken seriously by improving sewage and waste systems. After antibiotics, money instead was diverted into treatment-focused research (totally, or majorly, explains the current demise of American public infrastructure). "

No lexile level has been provided for this book. This book has a total of 367 pages. I read it from the internet so it might be less pages in actual book. I recommend this book to people who have good writing and reading skills in English and I do not have very good english and struggled to read this book. I also recommend this book to people who want to know more about how medicines and drugs were created that did not harm human tissue but instead harm only the bacteria with minor side effects.I chose the book The Demon Under The Microscope because I have read many reviews about this book on Goodreads and other articles and they all recommend this book to everyone and say that it is a wonderful book and that everyone should read it. This book is different from my previous Badge Book because my previous badge book was about fiction and it was a story. This book is about history of medicine.This book is life changing because In this book is the story of a German scientist and his struggles to make new drugs that will change the world and bring a new era of medicine and science that saved billions of lives.I believe that this book will help me in my hero’s journey as there are many lessons in this book and many people in this book are now my heroes in the medicine field.The ReviewAfter reading this book I learned a lot of lessons and I also learned a lot about how proper medicine was made. I had some difficulties reading The Demon Under The Microscope by Thomas Hager as I mentioned up earlier. But I still recommend this book to everyone as it improves grammar includes a lot of lessons and teaches us a lot about how medicine was made and how strep infections were cured using the first Sulfa Drugs. This book was written in August 28, 2007. I think that the Author was trying to inform everyone of how proper medicines that did not harm human tissue came to be. The author succeeded in this but I found that the book completely missed some information and gave a lot of unnecessary information. It missed information about antibiotics and had unnecessary information that was not related to medicine or inventing the medicine. The book could have contained easier words for the audience to understand more. The book could also have removed the unnecessary information to make the book shorter. Despite all this the book has it positive points like it is very informative and is successful in proving the point the author was trying to make. The author wrote this in a very weird way as he wandered off of the main topic and the story is like short biographies. The book is mainly about how a German scientist names Gerhard Domagk started working with a team in a factory called Bayer and after years of struggles and failures to find solutions to the most deadliest disease of that time, Strep. They found a cure and it was Sulfa Drugs. Gerhard Domagk earned a Nobel prize but when he earned the Nobel prize all of his work was in the past now and a new era of medicine was rising.This book helped me in my hero’s journey as it taught me lot of lessons, a great respect for german education and history and helped me a lot in understanding new and hard words.My question to Thomas Hager the author of this book is that Why did the author write the book in such a way that he wanders off the main topic, creating short biographies which are completely unrelated to the main topic."
52,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188312-brad,4,"A solid history of the discovery of the first antibiotic--sulfa. I remember learning the basics of this history and how the chemical works in one of my junior level microbiology classes. This book did a really good job of filling in more of the human story around the discovery and the challenging process of getting there. Lots of ups and downs, false starts, time spent on things which (in hindsight) were a waste. Among all of this, international disputes ranging from simple economic concerns to both world wars. Hager focuses primarily on the man who won the Nobel prize for the discovery, Gerhard Domagk, with significant chunks of time also on his chemist colleagues, the chemist / manager who set up Domagk's lab at Bayer and led to big changes in how pharmaceutical research is done, and some of the French and British individuals involved in figuring out more about which component of Prontosil was active and testing / publicizing that data. There are smaller bits about some physicians of note during the wars, anecdotes about Churchill and the sons of Coolidge and FDR and their encounters with infectious disease. In the epilogue he talks about how sulfa was left behind not long after its discover (within about 20 years) by the development of other antibiotics starting with penicillin. He briefly touches on antibiotic resistance and that they were starting to see the consequences of antibiotic overuse as early as the 1950s. The only place I had trouble with the book was his apparent lamenting in the epilogue of the loss of homeopathy and naturopathy in mainstream medicine. Granted, this was only 2 paragraphs and I am admittedly biased, but the reason they have generally been left behind is that they *don't actually work*. Tim Minchin comments in one of his pieces (not sure if the adage is his or it belongs to someone else, but I heard it from him first so he'll get the credit tonight) that alternative medicine, when it is proven to work, is called medicine. I'll sure have egg on my face if homeopathy is ever proven to have any shred of usefulness beyond placebo effect, but the idea of something growing more potent the more dilute it is flies in the face of reason and evidence. Anyway, I'm commenting more on those two paragraphs than they probably deserve and it's time to move on. In short, very interesting read that might not appeal to everyone but hit a sweet spot for me. Rating: PG-13 for some of the descriptions of Nazi prison camps and the experiments that happened in them. "

More history than I can usually even dream of trudging through, but, as a medical student with a BS in microbiology, I found this journey fascinating at (most) every turn. Enough medicine to keep me extremely interested, but not so in the weeds that someone without medical training couldn't keep up. *I don't consider anything I wrote to be a spoiler, because it's essentially what you can read on the book jacket... plus we all know that antibiotics do ultimately exist ;) Everyone's heard of the accidental discovery of penicillin, but I never knew the long and purposeful discovery of sulfa drugs. I had always assumed penicillins came first, so the story of research and work in this book was really incredible. The writer reminds us throughout the book how devastating even minor infections were only 100 years ago. At the beginning of the book, he drops us in a world where post-op infections were extremely common and often deadly. And that's without even considering all the everyday infections, from cuts, or pneumonia. It's amazing how much the world was changed by the work of these researchers in the early 20th century. Not only do readers learn about the discovery of sulfa drugs, but we get to see the development of a revolutionary way of conducting research, unheard of at the time. Once sulfa snowballed past the original scientist, with his meticulous ways, the author hits on an instance that led the FDA to become the important regulatory body as it is today, which I found particularly interesting. I actually thought, if anything, the book underscores the importance of sulfa drugs today. He sort of acts like penicillins came along, then sulfa antibiotics were never heard from again. But they're still widely used in infections, both outpatient and inpatient. The book briefly mentions diuretics, specifically thiazides, and I wish that would've been more than an afterthought. The very well-known loop diuretic Lasix is derived from sulfa. I almost didn't read this book, because I saw a review say it was borderline Nazi-apologetic, but I absolutely did not find that to be true at all, FYI. I listened to the audiobook version."
54,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"Hager tells the story of the invention of sulfa, the first antibiotic, predominately by focusing on the life and work of Gerhard Domagk, though there are plenty of sidebars where other parts of the tale are filled in. The result is a book that is not told in a linear fashion. Indeed, the book pings around the calendar like a pinball machine in the first half in particular. It starts, quite oddly, at December 1941 and the attack on Pearl Harbour (presumably to orientate the book for an American audience), then swaps to 1914-18, then the 1920s interspersed with 1084, the seventeenth century, the 1870s, the eighteenth century, nineteenth century, and also travelling from Germany to France, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, the US. From around page 70 it starts to settle down into a more linear narrative, progressing from the late 1920s through to late 1930s, mostly located in Germany, with a few forays to England, France and the US. The story also starts to diversify from Domagk and medical tales to the wider political economy of the pharmaceutical industry and science, as not only did sulfa products lead to a revolution in treatment, but also how the drugs were developed, tested and approved, after one particular drug had catastrophic effects. Prior to sulfa, pretty much anyone could create and market a health product without highly regulated testing or naming ingredients or side effects. Indeed, Hager goes as far as to argue that the nature of health care was fundamentally changed, with physicians moving from being caregivers to technicians, and the predominant site of care moving from home to hospital. Having been forced to reject his Nobel prize by the Nazis in 1938, Domagk finally received it in 1947. Despite the fractured narrative, created by trying to centre the story on Domagk when it is really a multi-threaded tale, Hager tells a fascinating history in an engaging voice."
55,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4910697-edy-gies,3,"Prior to reading this book I knew that a great deal of work went into producing medicines, but I didn't understand the process. This is a layman's guide to the great deal of research required to produce medicine in the early 1900s. For millennia men and women have searched for Panacea, a drug that will cure all woes. Today we still search, although that cure can only be found in the saving grace of God. This detailed the failures and success of the drugs that came before penicillin that could stop bacterial infections. Unfortunately, they stopped working because the bacteria became resistant and stronger drugs were found. We are still learning the lessons studied and created by these researchers. I was also surprised to discover that drug companies have been driven by profits for more than the recent past. I don't know why I thought of corporate greed as a thing of the modern world, sigh.Aside from the information about sulfa and anti-bacterial medicines I learned two interesting things. Germany was a late comer to the world stage. Britain, France, Spain, and the Netherlands had all made fortunes from colonization around the world, but Germany wasn't strong enough to colonize around the world so they grew at home. They took science from being a pass time of the wealthy to being a modern profession. German engineering and scientific research grew because that is how they proved themselves superior to other nations and today we are still seeing the results of that. Second, after the World War I the allies stripped Bayer and other drug companies of many of their patents. Germany had to start over to compete in the medical research field and we are still benefiting from some of those patents. I found this book interesting and helpful in understand the history of the medicine we so often take for granted. "
56,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16939642-brenda-rezk,5,"This book gave a historical account of the impacts and treatment of infectious disease and the rolls of physicians, pharmacists, chemical companies, individual scientists, government regulations, consumers, colonialism, and two world wars before, during, and after the discovery of the antibiotic properties of sulfa drugs. This book is part biography of the Nobel Prize winning German research scientist who tested hundreds of dye-based chemicals on thousands of infected research animals, as well as in vitro on various pathogenic bacteria. The author provides background on the state of infectious disease in hospitals, among general populations, in colonial wars, and during WWI and II and the research and treatment trends at the time. He also notes the lack of standardized large-scale, double-blind human drug trials and points out how haphazard and, by today's standards, unethical testing occurred on African citizens, institutionalized mental health patients, orphans and prisoners, military personnel, and uninformed patients. There were also unethical forced mutilations, infections, and treatments conducted in Nazi concentration camps. Some prisoners were forced to work as slave labourers at the chemical companies, as well. The author goes on the explore the barely-regulated US pharmaceutical environment of snake-oil remedies marketed directly to consumers, who diagnosed themselves or consulted druggists and bought whatever they wanted for self-medication. The proliferation of sulfa-based remedies from less reliable chemical companies led to multiple deaths and finally led to federal laws updating and strengthening the regulatory power of the FDA. This is a highly relevant story in this age of government deregulation."

A few years later, Franklin D. Roosevelt's son also contracted a deadly bacterial infection. However, he survived, thanks to a new superstar in the drug industry which went on to revolutionise medicine and lay the foundations for modern medicine.The book takes us through an epic journey scripted by inspiring, determined and hardworking individuals. Gerhard Domagk, while serving during WW1, saw his fellow soldiers succumb to gas gangrene, a deadly bacterial disease which was incurable during those days. He made it his life's 'mission': to discover a 'magic bullet' which could cure us of bacterial infections.The author describes various turning points in not just the history of medicine discovery, but also in the domains of hygiene, hospital care, industrial research, etc.Sulfa not only cured millions of people but it was influential in the formation of the FDA, which in turn set up stringent laws and demanded thorough testing of new drugs to safeguard the public from any accidental toxic effects. The business model for major corporations, the framework of industrial research which consists of a highly organised group of chemists, lab assistants, pathologists, animal breeders, etc. was inspired by the structure set up at IG Farben, where the first sulfa drug was synthesised!In other words, it is difficult to understate the importance of sulfa and the miraculous effect it had on our healthcare! The book is a definite page-turner!"
58,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868960-omar-halabieh,5,"I recently finished reading The Demon Under The Microscope by Thomas Hager. As the author summarizes this book: ""Once a bacterial disease took hold in the body, humans in 1931 were as much the prey of the invisible killers as they had been since the beginning of history. All that was about to change...Sulfa happened. It started in the mid-1930s, with a series of findings made in Germany and France, discoveries that were at the time hailed as ""the miracle of miracles"" in modern medicine, advances that secured humans their first effective way to stop bacterial infections once they started. The work then spread to Great Britain and the United States, where tests of the still-experimental drug on humans. including the son of the president of the United States, confirmed its power.""Below are key excerpts from the book that I found to be particularly insightful: Nothing like it had been seen before. IG Farben was on the day of its birth the largest corporation in Germany, the largest business in Europe, the largest and most powerful chemical company in the world. It was also the world s third-largest business of any sort measured by numbers of employees, bested in the mid-1920s only by U.S. Steel and General Motors. As Duisberg hoped, the IG Farben structure led to coordinated research and rationalized production; member firms began complementing one another's efforts rather than duplicating them; resources were freed to invest in the next big products to generate the next big profits. At Bayer those products would include a number of new medicines. Childbed fever was rampant in the wards attended by students. Something appeared to be passing the infection from the dead women to the students and physicians, then from them to women in the delivery room. Semmelweis thought it likely, given the pattern, that the student physicians were carrying something, some bits of infectious material, perhaps scraps of tissue from the autopsies, from the autopsy area to the wards. These were the days before Lister and before Pasteur had shown that bacteria could cause disease. Hand washing was minimal, if it was done at all. The students and medical staff wore no gloves. All the doctors, young and old, generally wore the same clothes for days. Semmelweis came to believe that the infectious material was likely carried on the hands. To test the idea, he instructed all of his students to start washing their hands thoroughly in chloride of lime after any autopsy and before touching any patient. Then he tracked the results. As he had hoped, deaths among women treated by his students fell dramatically. Semmelweis excitedly told everyone about his findings, and soon his hand-washing practices were adopted throughout the Vienna Lying-in Hospital. Within a few years, the death rate in Division 1 fell to match that in Division 2. The pregnant women of Vienna stopped begging to be given a midwife. But, amn7inolv the second molecule, Kl-821—sulfanilamide linked not to an azo frame but instead to a relatively simple carbon-and-nitrogen string—worked, and worked extremely well. It stopped Strep infections in both mice and rabbits. When the first test results came in in mid-April, Domagk immediately ordered retests in strep-infected rabbits and got even better results. The grand dream of an effective antibacterial chemical—history's first—was about to be realized. Despite all the worries, skepticism, and disbelief, it appeared that Prontosil really cured human disease. A nontoxic internal disinfectant exquisitely targeted to bacteria, Ehrlich's long-sought Zauherkugeln, had finally been found. Panacea, after thousands of years of failed attempts, had finally awakened. By 1938, it was estimated that sulfa was saving the lives of ten thousand new mothers each year in Britain and the United States alone. Science still seemed to offer reason for optimism. By the time Sir Henry accepted his Nobel medal in Stockholm, however. Hitler had marched troops into the demilitarized Rhineland, Japan and Italy had allied with Germany—and the French, just four years after the discovery of Prontosil, were about to make the new German miracle drug worthless. Most important, however, was the discovery that the world's most effective antibacterial medicine was also among the simplest ever found. Everyone had been searching through all these complicated dyes, tinkering around the edges, while the real power was in a colorless add-on. As Bovet later put it, the Germans' complicated red car had a simple white engine. Like all great discoveries, sulfa engendered a host of unexpected benefits. During the postwar period, Prontosil and its chemical oirspring gave birth not just to antibiotics but to other new approaches to disease. Domagk's work, as noted, led to the semithiocarbazones for treating tuberculosis. That was just the beginning. When one doctor observed that patients taking sulfa urinated more often than others, subsequent research led to trying sulfa variants as a diuretic, a medicine used to increase urination and thus to alter the fluid balance in the body Eventually it led to the thiazide drugs, an important early family of diuretics used to treat hypertension. Understanding sulfas mode of action—its ability to act as an ""antimetabolite"" that substituted for a needed foodstuff, starving the target microorganism to death—led to research into other antimetabolites; the most important result was a family of new anticancer drugs. Another line of inquiry that started with sulfa led to antileprosy medications, another to a treatment for diabetes, another to a new line of antimalarials. In all these cases, the starting point was sulfa, but the end point was new kinds of medicine.In closing: Every great drug discovery (and every modem technological advance) carries with it, like the blood of the Gorgon mentioned in the epigraph that begins this b0ok, two opposing qualities: one positive, healing, and helpful; one negative, often unintended, sometimes deadly The ancient Greeks understood that. We must remember it, too.A highly recommended read in the area of medicine."
59,1400082137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8876999-yonika,5,"Thomas Hager wrote the biography of sulfa drugs in a novelette-like story, which is amazing! There are inspirations and tragic stories in the way of searching the cure for infections, the great maladies haunting human lives for centuries. I think this book should be a mandatory reading for anyone interested in medical and drug development, as this sulfa drugs were the first drug that confirmed the possibility of a 'magic bullet' (specific drug) for a disease (in this case, infection). Sulfa-class drugs were the first antibiotic (even before the famous penicillin) widely used to treat various infections, from the infection of childbirth (which could kill more than 50% of mothers giving birth during its epidemic) to the war-related infections during WWII. Sulfa is also the drug that underlies the principle of pharmacology and toxicity tests before a drug can be launched to the market. And thanks to sulfa that the FDA gained its position as the 'powerful' drug regulatory agency nowadays. Alas, almost all of sulfa's inventors suffered from tragic fate during WWII, despite the fact that they were the most meritorious people who 'saved' a lot of people during WWII."
