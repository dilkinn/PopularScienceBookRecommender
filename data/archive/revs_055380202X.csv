It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller A Brief History of Time published in 1988. In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to ""combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.""تاریخ نخستین خوانش: چهاردهم ماه آگوست سال 2005 میلادیعنوان: ج‍ه‍ان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو: دن‍ب‍ال‍ه‌ ک‍ت‍اب‌ ت‍اری‍خ‍چ‍ه‌ زم‍ان‌؛ نویسنده اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م م‍ح‍م‍درض‍ا م‍ح‍ج‍وب‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران: ح‍ری‍ر ش‍رک‍ت‌ س‍ه‍ام‍ی‌ ان‍ت‍ش‍ار‏‫‏‏، 1383؛ در 326ص؛ مصور؛ شابک 9649334254؛ چاپ دوم 1383؛ ‏‬چاپ سوم 1384؛ چاپ چهارم 1384؛ چاپ پنجم 1386؛ چاپ ششم 1387؛ چاپ هفتم 1388؛ چاپ نهم 1391؛ چاپ یازدهم 1393؛ دوازدهم 1395؛ چهاردهم 1397؛ موضوع کوانتوم از دانشمندان بریتانیایی - سده 21معنوان: کیهان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م: محمد قصاع؛ مشهد: آستان قدس رضوی، شرکت به نشر‏‫ ، 1386؛ در 225ص؛ شابک 9789640207604؛‬‏‬ چاپ دوم 1387؛ چاپ سوم 1388؛ چاپ چهارم 1390؛ عنوان: ج‍ه‍ان‌ در پ‍وس‍ت‌ گ‍ردو؛ نویسنده اس‍ت‍ی‍ون‌ ه‍اوک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م رضا راهدار؛ تهران، برجیس، 1384؛ در 248ص؛ شابک 964963304؛عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده استفن هاوکینگ؛ مترجم داوود نعمت‌اللهی؛ تهران معیار علم‏‫، 1392؛ در 267ص؛ شابک 9786005461374؛‬عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده: استفن هاوکینگ؛ مترجم: عبدالحسین صبوری؛ تهران شبگیر‏‫، ‏‫1394؛ در 238ص؛ شابک 9786006774114؛ چاپ سوم 1397؛عنوان: جهان در پوست گردو؛ نویسنده: استفن هاوکینگ ؛ مترجم: صمد غلامی؛ تهران ناقوس، ‏‫‏‏‏1396؛ در 266ص؛ شابک 9786004730754؛فهرست مطالب کتاب: یک: تاریخچه مختصر نسبیت؛ دوم: شکل زمان؛ سوم: جهان در پوست گردو؛ چهارم: پیشگویی آینده؛ پنجم: نگهبانی از گذشته؛ ششم: آینده ما؟ پیشتازان فضا یا نه؟ هفتم: دنیای جدید برِین؛یک برآمد بسیار مهم نسبیت رابطة بین جرم و انرژی است؛ ادعای آلبرت اینشتین که سرعت نور باید برای تمام ناظران یکسان باشد ایجاب می‌کند که هیج چیز نمی‌تواند تندتر از نور حرکت کند؛ در نتیجه استفاده از انرژی برای شتاب دادن هر چیز چه ذره باشد و چه سفینه فضائی، بر جرمش می‌افزاید و کار را سختتر می‌کند؛ شتاب دادن یک ذره تا سرعت نور ناممکن خواهد بود؛ زیرا بی‌نهایت انرژی لازم خواهد داشت؛ جرم و انرژی معادل هستند؛ آنطور که در فرمول معروف اینشتاین خلاصه شده ‌است: ای مساوی ام سی دو؛ می‌توان گفت این معادله در فیزیک، تنها معادله‌ ای است که زبانزد خاص و عام است؛ در میان برآمدهای آن، درک این بود، که اگر هسته یک اتم اورانیوم شکافته، و به دو هسته، با جرم‌های تقریباً کمتر تقسیم شود، انرژی بی اندازهٔ زیادی تولید خواهد کردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/03/199هجری خورشید؛ ا. شربیانی"

2,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1868162-nick,3,"Hawking is an exceedingly clear and occasionally quite funny writer, not easy when the topic is quantum physics, etc. I would be lying if I claimed to understand much of this book, especially in the audiobook format in which an exceedingly pleasant British voice hurls a flood of Hawking's words and concepts, one more challenging than the previous one. It might, repeat: might, have been possible to understand this material on a printed page, which in this case included a lot of nifty diagrams, on the presumption that repetition might have helped. But probably not. I did enjoy and generally understand the opening chapter in which Hawking explained the history of physics and our conception of the universe, with a beautiful presentation of the life and work of Einstein, and to a lesser extent his contemporaries and immediate intellectual followers. But after that, when Hawking moved into contemporary physics and the exploration of the cosmos (where he made his own contributions, mind you), I was mostly gasping for air, down for the count, you get the idea. Once I let go of the expectation that I could actually master the material, I kind of enjoyed the periodic appearance of concepts and phrases I had sort-of known about arrive in their natural and proper context, things like string theory, black holes, quanta, Heisenberg principle, nebula, etc. Perhaps more than anything, I enjoyed the ebulliance and delight with which Hawking presents his material, as if it is the simplest and most fun thing ever... which to him, it probably is."
3,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"Stephen Hawking, stated in, "" The Universe in a Nutshell"" that our history is filled with infinite potentiality and what we ""got” was due to disturbing the quantum field by our ""observations."" Profound, I thought, and pondered about his theory for months. To better understand Dr. Hawking's theory, I read everything on quantum physics I could understand and a pile of books on the brain, Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" was the most helpful. Below is what I believe correlates with Hawking's theory, It is from the book, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts, (Seth Material) I have included a quote and then how I am seeing life now through a magical lens. ""An examination of your conscious thoughts will tell you much about the state of your inner mind, your intentions and expectations, and will often lead you to a direct confrontation with challenges and problems. Your thoughts, studied , will let you see where you are going. They point clearly to the nature of physical events. What exists physically existed first in thought and feeling. There is no other rule.What if our ""observations"" were first feeling-tone shared by all consciousness focused in physical reality. The cells and organs have their own awarenesses, and a gestalt one. So the race of man also has individual consciousness and a gestalt or mass consciousness of which makes up our physical reality. While physical we follow physical laws, or assumptions. These form the framework for corporeal expression. Within this framework you have full freedom to create your experience, your personal life in all of its aspects; the living picture of the world, your personal life, and to some extent your individual living experience, helped create the world as it is known in your time.It is important before we continue that you realize that consciousness is within all physical phenomena, however. It is vital that you realize your position within nature. Nature is created from within. The personal life that you know rises up from within you, yet is given. period. Since you are part of Being, then in a certain fashion you give yourself the life that is being lived through you."" ~ Jane Roberts, Seth Material.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.” ― Stephen HawkingWhen I fully realized my entire reality was created by me, and global consciousness, I could chose what to give my attention to for the change I wanted to see. The more you examine your thoughts and feelings the more excited you'll get when what you were thinking about appears. You'll notice ""integrity"" plays a role as well, (even when no one but you knows what good things you've done), because it's ""liking yourself"" that is most important in your ability to thrive without limitations. It only works if you truly believe. Just like Yoda said, “there is no try, only do.”Whatever you hold in your consciousness you put in your reality. If you are thinking about something, it will appear in a similar form. Don't get scared when you notice you have a lot of negative thoughts, about yourself and the world. These types of ""thoughts"" are your current vibration, giving you the reality you have now. Any change towards better inner-feelings about yourself and your surroundings will show up immediately in a in an event confirming your power to create your reality. I am now excited about cleaning up my thoughts -especially my deep inner feelings that were not as great as I wanted them to be. Below are examples of limiting beliefs you may want to remove.Example of limiting thoughts:1. My behavior is hidden in my subconsciousness. 2. My life is a result of my childhood, or Karma, 3. Old age causes illness and regression. 4. People are out to screw me. Or People don't like me.5. I am not smart enough, good enough, someone is better than me.6. My religion is the right one, and so are my beliefs. 7. I have no control over the events in my life.8. I am fat.9. There is something wrong with money. People who have it are greedy, less spiritual than those who are poor. They are unhappier, and snobs.These are all beliefs held by many people. Those who have them will meet them in experience. Physical data will always seem to reinforce the beliefs, therefore, but the beliefs formed the reality.""The ego, which is ever changing based on a flow of new experiences looks out upon physical reality and surveys it in relation to those characteristics of which it is composed at any given time. It makes its judgments according to its own idea of itself."" ~Jane RobertsI try to catch myself in conversation making jokes about myself, and stop it. )When science has proven ""consciousness creates everything in our reality"" our focus will turn to beautiful stories, ideas and breathtaking environments. We will spot giving our attention to garbage news stories filled with violence and fear; because we don't believe what we hold these emotions in our consciousness mind. If I could ask Dr. Hawking one question it would be this:You said that we collapse waves when we observe an event. But what if-- our expectation collapsed the wave, our belief before the form existed. If this is true, consciousness is creating the collapsing of the field based on our inner-emotions, which would make the unpopular words, like ""emotions, feelings and insights"" the most valuable of all our senses. I learned most of my beliefs were secondhand and limiting, so I jumped those fences!I documented my journey in my memoir, ""From Hollywood to God,"" by Kelly Granite Enckhttp://www.amazon.com/From-Hollywood-...I am leaving the link for those, like me, who love to explore the Inner Journey of the Mind!Thanks Stephen for all your years of passion! Love Kelly!"
4,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64966022-himanshu-karmacharya,4,"The purpose of science is not only to answer the most perplexing questions, but also to arouse curiosity in the mind of the readers about the universe. While many books on science do give valuable information, they fail to achieve the latter purpose, as mentioned earlier. This book however succeeds in achieving both.The Universe in a Nutshell is considered as a sequel to Hawking's previous bestseller, A Brief History of Time. The book, as the title suggests, discusses about the history and principles of the physical universe, in a nutshell. The topics are discussed in just the fair amount of detail and simplicity, although there are some topics which are just too advanced to understand.Despite being nearly 2 decades old, the book still holds it value, and readers can give it go if they are curious to know about the universe, but lack lots of free time."

6,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,4,"First of all, I expected the Hawking's electronic voice for narrating the audiobook. Though it might sound silly, I'm more fond of his unique voice.After his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time in 80s, he wanted to propagandize the current frontier we're encountering but this time in a more brief way. The First two chapters serve as a prerequisite for proper understanding. Short but very well explained introductory concepts of Einstein-Relativity stuffs; Maybe because i used to read a lot of books in that subject (I've read more books on relativity than automobile engineering in which I've got a bachelor's recently).Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and its unification attempts with relativity at the initial conditions of the universe. Time and extra dimensions for the maintenance of consistencies. Some little dip in the chaos theory but too much idea regarding it in this book.Some chapters on his (and his colleagues) attempts on the formulations of the Quantum Gravity theory, then evolving into Super Gravity, then String theories and eventually m-theory atleast for now (Eventually is not the correct usage).Blackhole information paradox and the concepts of imaginary time are correlated to hinder the optimistic possibilities of Time Travel atleast for now. The Paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. I feel personally that this Part needs revisiting again. Even the simple terms and explanations, these are much more complex topics undergoing tedious *theoritical* research currently. He also reassures the readers sarcastically that this might be a part of government cover up for Time Travel Conspiracy; You get to know only when you get to meet one like HG Wells.What I can assure is, that one could get a better view on string theory based M-theory which currently has the higher chance to become the Theory of Everything and the concepts of brane worlds.  And that is my Review in a Nutshell. "

I've been told that Stephen Hawking is not as complicated to read as one might assume. While I did learn a lot from this book, I also was left with a lot more questions. Furthermore, the illustrations were either confusing or totally unnecessary. "

9,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604686-mike-ogilvie,3,"I really enjoyed A Brief History of Time and so was looking forward to The Universe in a Nutshell and its updated material. I was hoping it would be a ""dumbed down"" version of some of the high-end theoretical physics ideas that I haven't had the time or brain cells to keep up with.While I'm sure the content is dumbed down from Stephen Hawking's level, most of it is covered at a level and speed that kept it out of my comprehension. To be honest I find a lot of modern theories and ideas very skeptical - it almost seems to me that the theories are created and given weight because they might be possible... and that's good enough because to prove otherwise is incredibly difficult. A part of me (no doubt remnants of thinking left there by my college professors) downplays my pessimism and wants to believe them at face value. In this book I was looking to confirm that part, but it just didn't happen. There didn't seem to be any real explanations or support (or maybe it was above my head and I zoned out). It was simply describing the theories (e.g., M Theory) and presenting them as fact. (We used to call this ""hand waving"" in my Physics classes in college - like a magician's hand waving as misdirection.)There were a lot of good parts that were interesting and engaging. Near the end there was a part on the evolution of life on Earth and humans that was really intriguing. It had to do with DNA as a form of evolutionary method of saving data which has now been augmented by humans' ability to store information outside of our DNA now. And I do now have a better understanding of the framework on some modern theories (like multi-dimensions) that I didn't have before. I particularly liked coming to a better understanding of the theory of our perception of reality being a mere projection of 4 dimensions (3d + time) that derives from a ""real"" existence that exists in a 5 dimensional ""membrane"" universe (much like a 3d object casts a 2d shadow). Cool stuff.Maybe I just need a bigger brain."
10,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,4,"I really liked ""A Brief History of Time"" much more.While it isn't that bad (it's actually very good), in comparison with Brief History, it seems only to have many more illustrations and fewer thorough explanations.I understand that Hawking tried to write a popular science book with a branching non-linear structure without depending heavily on what has been said in the previous chapters, but I don't think that's actually possible. At least I honestly doubt it could be done without losing a significant portion of quality and precision.I don't know, I read too much about these kinds of things anyway so I guess I might not be right, it could be just what an intelligent layman without too much time needs. But that's a big maybe. Try it, after all, I put 4 stars up there for a reason."
11,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"I do not yet have intellect enough to comprehend the entirety of the book. However, for the extent I managed to understand, I must say it was incredibly brilliant. I didn't begin the book with the expectation of thorough understanding, so there was no disappointment. Furthermore, it was actually a relief that I could get a lot of the stuff in the book considering the fact that it is written by Hawking. I am glad I gave it a try. I will boldly explore science non-fiction from now on.As for the writing, his simple language coupled with complicated theories resulted in a good flow. There is occasional intelligent humour that makes you chuckle in delight and subtle satire that helps you connect with Hawking."

13,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42706900-mahira,4,"About Time TravelWhat really sparked my interest in time travel, was the ascension of The Prophet Mohammad, this makes him the first person to have traveled in time through a black hole. The description of a black hole being mentioned explicitly in a Chapter of Qur'an known as Surah NajamWhen the stars are extinguished. (Qur'an, 77:8)[I swear] by Heaven and the Tariq! And what will convey to you what the Tariq is? The Star Piercing [the darkness]! (Qur'an, 86:1-3)For more visit the link below:https://www.islamicity.org/3517/some-...What is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?Time must have a beginning in what is called the big bang. Similar arguments show that time would have an end, when stars or galaxies collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.If one follows our past light cone back in time, it will be bent back by the matter in the early universe. The whole universe we observe is contained within a region whose boundary shrinks to zero at the big bang. This would be a singularity, a place where the density of matter would be infinite and classical general relativity would break down.While 10 or 11 dimensions don’t sound much like the spacetime we experience, the idea was that the other 6 or 7 dimensions are curled up so small that we don't notice them; we are only aware of the remaining 4 large and nearly flat dimensions. String theories are not of much use for describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curves the universe or forms a bound state, like a black hole. For these situations, one needs supergravity, which is basically Einstein's theory of curved spacetime with some extra kinds of matter.SpookyThe area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.Amazing>The most obvious thing about space is that it goes on and on and on. This has been confirmed by modern instruments such as the Hubble telescope, which allows us to probe deep into space. What we see are billions and billions of galaxies of various shapes and sizes. Each galaxy contains uncounted billions of stars, many of which have planets around them. We live on a planet orbiting a star in an outer arm of the spiral Milky Way galaxy.HubbleIt was Hubble who recognized the dramatic implications of this discovery: on the large scale, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. The universe is expanding.It came as a total surprise, and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe. If the galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer together in the past. From the present rate of expansion, we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed ten to fifteen billion years ago.THE BIG BANGEinstein's general theory of relativity implied that the universe and time itself must have had a beginning in a tremendous explosion.When the universe is big, as it is today, there are a very large number of rolls of the dice, and the results average out to something one can predict. That is why classical laws work for large systems. But when the universe is very small, as it was near in time to the big bang, there are only a small number of rolls of the dice, and the uncertainty principle is very important.The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behavior.Endless PossibilitiesThere seem to be various possibilities, depending on the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more than a certain critical amount, the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow them down and will eventually stop them from flying apart. They will then start falling toward each other and will all come together in a big crunch that will be the end of the history of the universe in real time.If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies from flying apart forever. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get increasingly emptier and colder. So, again, things will come to an end, but in a less dramatic way.When Copernicus and Galileo discovered that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth, and Newton discovered the laws that govern their motion, astrology became extremely implausible. Why should the positions of other planets against the background sky as seen from Earth have any correlations with the macromolecules on a minor planet that call themselves intelligent lifeAbsolute time defiedIn 1905, the concept of absolute time was overthrown by the special theory of relativity, in which time was no longer an independent quantity on its own but was just one direction in a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Dark StarsMichell argued that there could be stars that are much more massive than the Sun and have escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see these stars, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by the gravity of the star. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars and we now call black holes.The radiation from a black hole will carry away energy, which must mean that the black hole will lose mass and get smaller. In turn, this will mean that its temperature will rise and the rate of radiation will increase. Eventually the black hole will get down to zero mass. We don't know how to calculate what happens at this point, but the only natural, reasonable outcome would seem to be that the black hole disappears completely. So what happens then to the part of the wave function inside the black hole and the information it contains about what had fallen into the black hole?However, according to the picture of one member of a virtual-particle pair falling in and the other member escaping, one would not expect the escaping particle to be related to what fell in, or to carry away information about it. So the only answer would seem to be that the information in the part of the wave function inside the black hole gets lostP-branesAndrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa made an important advance. They chose to regard a black hole as being made up of a number of building blocks, called p-brane . Recall that one way of thinking about p-branes is as sheets that move through the three dimensions of space and also through seven extra dimensions that we don't notice.Does part of the wave function get lost down black holes, or does all the information get out again, as the p-brane model suggests? This is one of the outstanding questions in theoretical physics today.WORMHOLESBut you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out. So you might think that you could do something like blowing up the rocket on its launch pad to prevent your setting out in the first place. This is a variation of the grandfather paradox: what happens if you go back and kill your grandfather before your father was conceived?At present our computers remain outstripped in computational power by the brain of a humble earthworm.The brain does not have a single CPU— central processing unit—that processes each command in sequence. Rather, it has millions of processors working together at the same time. Such massively parallel processing will be the future for electronic intelligence as well.The human race has been in its present form for only two million years out of the fifteen billion years or so since the big bangA shocking reality check!Many of us may choose to live a virtual existence? Forming cyber-friendships and relationships!Funniest revelationIt is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war. So as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us.To the naked eye a hair looks like a line; its only dimension appears to be length. Similarly, spacetime may look four-dimensional to us, but appear ten- or eleven-dimensional when probed with very high-energy particles."
14,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32828173-sleepydrummer,3,"We all owe a sacred debt to Stephen Hawking for his theories and contributions to physics. Approaching this book with a mild understanding of basic physics, I simply exhausted myself in his space-time, extra dimensions ""Nutshell"". The amount of energy it took to comprehend a fraction of what I read left me in a swirling vacuum fluctuation. It is an honor to have read Professor Hawking's book. I will tentatively rate three stars simply because the subject matter as presented was mind-numbing, although rightfully this material is five stars."
15,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10848903-abbass-maanna,3,"It was my first ride with Stephen Hawking , and it wasn't bad at all. Reading about your UNIVERSE for the first time, in such a detailed explanation for what the writer aims to tell based on his wide knowledge in Quantum mechanics, theoretical physics and cosmology , necessarily requires a knowledgeable reader in the sciences I've just mentioned so he/she wouldn't be perplexed and then, he would get answers for many questions that may flash in his mind.In addition to the diverse information that one can get from reading this , he quietly doesn't get bored due to Hawking's sense of humor. It is highly recommended for those who care much about the universe and its studies. "

You can notice that Stephen tried his best to explain concepts that are by far not easy to explain. I had to read some of the pages multiple times, until I was almost sure that I understood at least some of the things that were explained. I know that this subject is not for everyone, but even if you grasp half of what this book contains, I believe you will have a much better understanding of the theories that try to explain everything around us.The universe around us is fascinating!"

I am used to listening to scientific materials, most of them in form of debates. But listening to an audio book is nothing compared to reading - you cannot turn back the page or re-read a passage, you cannot make notes with a pencil on the page, you cannot highlight key definitions, aseertions, or conclusions in the text. Eye-sight is also a much more efficient tool in gathering information than the ear. "

19,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157406-omar-ali,4,"SECTION: HERALD REVIEW/BooksFile: uni.docWords: 712By Omar AliWanted: Nutcracker	The number of books trying to explain science to the 'layman' has simply exploded in the last few years. But Professor Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, remains the biggest star in the field. although his first book, A Brief History of Time, sold over a million copies, Hawking is well aware that far too many readers never made it beyond the first few pages. So he says he set out to write ""a different kind of book that might be easier to understand."" Hawking's new book The Universe in a Nutshell is beautifully produced but breaks very little new ground, conveying little more than a 'take it on faith' explanation of what physicists think of the cosmos.	 The first two chapters introduce relativity and the problems of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. While the illustrations are some of the best you will ever see in a science book, there is almost no attempt to try and explain the reasoning that led Einstein to his revolutionary conclusions. These chapters provide a kind of general introduction to the subject and are followed by a series of essays on various aspects of modern cosmology. The discerning reader will come away with some vague understanding that modern physics has rejected the common sense views of time and space, that general relativity and quantum effects somehow need to be reconciled, that there is something very important called the ""uncertainty principle"", (even though it's not as uncertain as you thought: God may not know the position and the momentum of a particle to perfection, but he does know the wave function), black holes exist, naked singularities probably do not and it might all come down to strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions (but we can't really know for sure till we build a particle accelerator larger than the solar system). 	 The penultimate chapter has some interesting speculation about how life and intelligence may evolve in the future and the final chapter gives a very light introduction to M-theory, which seems to be Hawking's current favourite for a possible ""theory of everything"": one grand framework to explain the known universe, from big bang to big crunch and everything in between (though, like Robert Frost, physicists are still unsure if it will end in fire or in ice). 	Along the way, Hawking tells us several times that he is a positivist, which means he really can't say what all this ""means"", except that it is a mathematical model which fits observations and makes predictions that work. But this philosophical reticence seems at odds with a persistent hopefulness that the full explanation is around the corner. Why should we expect any such total understanding in the near future? Is it not more likely that in science, as in theology, we have only just begun? That our descendants may well see what we cannot even begin to imagine? And their descendants even further? 	The physicist Freeman Dyson has said: ""As a scientist, I live in a universe of overwhelming size and mystery. The mysteries of life and language, good and evil, chance and necessity, and of our own existence as conscious beings in an impersonal cosmos are even greater than the mysteries of physics and astronomy. Behind the mysteries that we can name, there are deeper mysteries that we have not even begun to explore"". It is this awareness that seems to be missing in Hawking's book. (One dare not think that it is missing from professor Hawking himself.) Ultimately, Universe in a Nutshell is a coffee table book that is not detailed enough to teach you anything original and yet far too complicated for many scientific illiterates to follow. But it may well serve as a good introduction and lead the reader to other books that do a better job of actually explaining the physics as well as other mysteries that extend far deeper. "
20,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"4.25/5 starsThis is the seventh Stephen Hawking's book I've read so far, and I have to confess that the last half of the materials in ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" are pretty difficult to wrap my brain around since most of the topics are about the frontiers of theoretical physics and cosmology. However, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book (where I can understand). I wouldn't dare to be the first to make that joke, but Professor Hawking joked that although he held Isaac Newton's chair as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, his is electric and Newton's was not. I will return to this book in the future once I have a better grasp on mathematics for theoretical physics; reading the theory in words alone doesn't help much. "

But definitely my choice of media was not wise as getting this information via an audiobook brought my comprehension to less than 50%. If I have the chance to read the illustrated version of the book, I expect to increase my chances of absorbing such fantastic but complicated concepts."

This illuminating and enlightening book takes one on the most thrilling venture through space and time, wherein extraordinary marvels lie in wait. The true genius of Stephen Hawking is something that cannot fail to surprise, as this book is filled with pages of diagrams and fantastically detailed images. The complexities, excentricities and ideas of such a man is brilliantly captured in every page, therefore you'll never quite regard space and the universe in the same way ever again. 'It's all a matter of where one places themselves in life's continuous timeline' Here are some of my favourite quotes that I gained inspiration from the book... What keeps one grounded inevitably is slow in its origin That which fluctuates in peaks and troughs isn't generally relative to the common norm 'Politics for the moment, but an equation for eternity!' --Albert Einstein'Nothing puzzles me like time and space. And yet nothing troubles me less than time and space, because i never think of them' --19th century author, Charles Lamb  A scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple observations and will make definite predictions that can be tested.  --FACT! Creation is hierachal like Dante's inferno, and we're all sinking with a gravitational pull! Time travel is possible with a vast imagination! Does one drift around in various areas (reflection), or move with the time's (progression)?  This book is essential reading for those budding scientists keen to understand more about are universe, as it's packed with fascinating facts from a true legend and clever mind. You may say that there are different expressions to explain the same underlying theory, which is true, however Hawking's is one of the easier to understand and the most informative. The universe in a nutshell guides you on the search to discover those hidden secrets beyond our stratosphere, such as; supersymetry, M-theory, holography and many more while combining other scientists imput. Ideas from Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Richard Feynman's histories are included all in this fantastic compendium of knowledge. I certainly enjoyed reading this book and found it most informative and instructive for my own study purposes.

The idea behind it -other than making a lit of money- according o the author is to explore some of the topic that were put in late chapters in the aforementioned book that were perhaps not read as well as sharing the later scientific discoveries (the first book was published in 1988, this one in 2001).Just as the first book the Hawking writings in general, the book is mostly easy to understand although it is not as good. In it he takles the follow tooics/questions: Einstein and the theories of special and general relativity, cosmological constant, What is time, String theory, Blackhole radiation, Time travel, Scientific discoveries in the early 20th century such as the existence of other galaxies and Expanding universe, Feyman's interpretation of quantum physics, Does the universe have a beginning or is it infinite?, The anthropic principle, History and future of the universeAstrology and future prediction, Scientific Determinism and uncertainty principle, Blackholes and predictions, Wormholes, Future of humanity, M theory, dark matter, artificial intelligence and Gravitational waves."

Hawking is making assumptions along the way while discussing problems of quantum gravity, quantum physics and Einstein’s general relativity. Starting with superstring theory, P-Branes theory and arbitrary time, Hawkins conclude that our universe holds many hidden dimensions impossible for us to observe. The future of computers and genetic engineering could bring us closer to unified theory of everything or maybe this all is a hallucination of the mind? The most fascinating part for me however was discussion of time. We all think we experience time. In everyday thinking, time is being reduced to a level of an individual- linear perception and chains of recalled mind experiences. And here comes my personal admiration for Hawking trying to discuss universal time while dissolving individual perception of the mind. To say, trying to take a look on the universe with a God’s eye "

32,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1868162-nick,3,"Hawking is an exceedingly clear and occasionally quite funny writer, not easy when the topic is quantum physics, etc. I would be lying if I claimed to understand much of this book, especially in the audiobook format in which an exceedingly pleasant British voice hurls a flood of Hawking's words and concepts, one more challenging than the previous one. It might, repeat: might, have been possible to understand this material on a printed page, which in this case included a lot of nifty diagrams, on the presumption that repetition might have helped. But probably not. I did enjoy and generally understand the opening chapter in which Hawking explained the history of physics and our conception of the universe, with a beautiful presentation of the life and work of Einstein, and to a lesser extent his contemporaries and immediate intellectual followers. But after that, when Hawking moved into contemporary physics and the exploration of the cosmos (where he made his own contributions, mind you), I was mostly gasping for air, down for the count, you get the idea. Once I let go of the expectation that I could actually master the material, I kind of enjoyed the periodic appearance of concepts and phrases I had sort-of known about arrive in their natural and proper context, things like string theory, black holes, quanta, Heisenberg principle, nebula, etc. Perhaps more than anything, I enjoyed the ebulliance and delight with which Hawking presents his material, as if it is the simplest and most fun thing ever... which to him, it probably is."
33,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"Stephen Hawking, stated in, "" The Universe in a Nutshell"" that our history is filled with infinite potentiality and what we ""got” was due to disturbing the quantum field by our ""observations."" Profound, I thought, and pondered about his theory for months. To better understand Dr. Hawking's theory, I read everything on quantum physics I could understand and a pile of books on the brain, Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" was the most helpful. Below is what I believe correlates with Hawking's theory, It is from the book, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts, (Seth Material) I have included a quote and then how I am seeing life now through a magical lens. ""An examination of your conscious thoughts will tell you much about the state of your inner mind, your intentions and expectations, and will often lead you to a direct confrontation with challenges and problems. Your thoughts, studied , will let you see where you are going. They point clearly to the nature of physical events. What exists physically existed first in thought and feeling. There is no other rule.What if our ""observations"" were first feeling-tone shared by all consciousness focused in physical reality. The cells and organs have their own awarenesses, and a gestalt one. So the race of man also has individual consciousness and a gestalt or mass consciousness of which makes up our physical reality. While physical we follow physical laws, or assumptions. These form the framework for corporeal expression. Within this framework you have full freedom to create your experience, your personal life in all of its aspects; the living picture of the world, your personal life, and to some extent your individual living experience, helped create the world as it is known in your time.It is important before we continue that you realize that consciousness is within all physical phenomena, however. It is vital that you realize your position within nature. Nature is created from within. The personal life that you know rises up from within you, yet is given. period. Since you are part of Being, then in a certain fashion you give yourself the life that is being lived through you."" ~ Jane Roberts, Seth Material.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.” ― Stephen HawkingWhen I fully realized my entire reality was created by me, and global consciousness, I could chose what to give my attention to for the change I wanted to see. The more you examine your thoughts and feelings the more excited you'll get when what you were thinking about appears. You'll notice ""integrity"" plays a role as well, (even when no one but you knows what good things you've done), because it's ""liking yourself"" that is most important in your ability to thrive without limitations. It only works if you truly believe. Just like Yoda said, “there is no try, only do.”Whatever you hold in your consciousness you put in your reality. If you are thinking about something, it will appear in a similar form. Don't get scared when you notice you have a lot of negative thoughts, about yourself and the world. These types of ""thoughts"" are your current vibration, giving you the reality you have now. Any change towards better inner-feelings about yourself and your surroundings will show up immediately in a in an event confirming your power to create your reality. I am now excited about cleaning up my thoughts -especially my deep inner feelings that were not as great as I wanted them to be. Below are examples of limiting beliefs you may want to remove.Example of limiting thoughts:1. My behavior is hidden in my subconsciousness. 2. My life is a result of my childhood, or Karma, 3. Old age causes illness and regression. 4. People are out to screw me. Or People don't like me.5. I am not smart enough, good enough, someone is better than me.6. My religion is the right one, and so are my beliefs. 7. I have no control over the events in my life.8. I am fat.9. There is something wrong with money. People who have it are greedy, less spiritual than those who are poor. They are unhappier, and snobs.These are all beliefs held by many people. Those who have them will meet them in experience. Physical data will always seem to reinforce the beliefs, therefore, but the beliefs formed the reality.""The ego, which is ever changing based on a flow of new experiences looks out upon physical reality and surveys it in relation to those characteristics of which it is composed at any given time. It makes its judgments according to its own idea of itself."" ~Jane RobertsI try to catch myself in conversation making jokes about myself, and stop it. )When science has proven ""consciousness creates everything in our reality"" our focus will turn to beautiful stories, ideas and breathtaking environments. We will spot giving our attention to garbage news stories filled with violence and fear; because we don't believe what we hold these emotions in our consciousness mind. If I could ask Dr. Hawking one question it would be this:You said that we collapse waves when we observe an event. But what if-- our expectation collapsed the wave, our belief before the form existed. If this is true, consciousness is creating the collapsing of the field based on our inner-emotions, which would make the unpopular words, like ""emotions, feelings and insights"" the most valuable of all our senses. I learned most of my beliefs were secondhand and limiting, so I jumped those fences!I documented my journey in my memoir, ""From Hollywood to God,"" by Kelly Granite Enckhttp://www.amazon.com/From-Hollywood-...I am leaving the link for those, like me, who love to explore the Inner Journey of the Mind!Thanks Stephen for all your years of passion!

While many books on science do give valuable information, they fail to achieve the latter purpose, as mentioned earlier. This book however succeeds in achieving both.The Universe in a Nutshell is considered as a sequel to Hawking's previous bestseller, A Brief History of Time. The book, as the title suggests, discusses about the history and principles of the physical universe, in a nutshell. The topics are discussed in just the fair amount of detail and simplicity, although there are some topics which are just too advanced to understand.Despite being nearly 2 decades old, the book still holds it value, and readers can give it go if they are curious to know about the universe, but lack lots of free time."

Though it might sound silly, I'm more fond of his unique voice.After his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time in 80s, he wanted to propagandize the current frontier we're encountering but this time in a more brief way. The First two chapters serve as a prerequisite for proper understanding. Short but very well explained introductory concepts of Einstein-Relativity stuffs; Maybe because i used to read a lot of books in that subject (I've read more books on relativity than automobile engineering in which I've got a bachelor's recently).Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and its unification attempts with relativity at the initial conditions of the universe. Time and extra dimensions for the maintenance of consistencies. Some little dip in the chaos theory but too much idea regarding it in this book.Some chapters on his (and his colleagues) attempts on the formulations of the Quantum Gravity theory, then evolving into Super Gravity, then String theories and eventually m-theory atleast for now (Eventually is not the correct usage).Blackhole information paradox and the concepts of imaginary time are correlated to hinder the optimistic possibilities of Time Travel atleast for now. The Paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. I feel personally that this Part needs revisiting again. Even the simple terms and explanations, these are much more complex topics undergoing tedious *theoritical* research currently. He also reassures the readers sarcastically that this might be a part of government cover up for Time Travel Conspiracy; You get to know only when you get to meet one like HG Wells.What I can assure is, that one could get a better view on string theory based M-theory which currently has the higher chance to become the Theory of Everything and the concepts of brane worlds.

I was hoping it would be a ""dumbed down"" version of some of the high-end theoretical physics ideas that I haven't had the time or brain cells to keep up with.While I'm sure the content is dumbed down from Stephen Hawking's level, most of it is covered at a level and speed that kept it out of my comprehension. To be honest I find a lot of modern theories and ideas very skeptical - it almost seems to me that the theories are created and given weight because they might be possible... and that's good enough because to prove otherwise is incredibly difficult. A part of me (no doubt remnants of thinking left there by my college professors) downplays my pessimism and wants to believe them at face value. In this book I was looking to confirm that part, but it just didn't happen. There didn't seem to be any real explanations or support (or maybe it was above my head and I zoned out). It was simply describing the theories (e.g., M Theory) and presenting them as fact. (We used to call this ""hand waving"" in my Physics classes in college - like a magician's hand waving as misdirection.)There were a lot of good parts that were interesting and engaging. Near the end there was a part on the evolution of life on Earth and humans that was really intriguing. It had to do with DNA as a form of evolutionary method of saving data which has now been augmented by humans' ability to store information outside of our DNA now. And I do now have a better understanding of the framework on some modern theories (like multi-dimensions) that I didn't have before. I particularly liked coming to a better understanding of the theory of our perception of reality being a mere projection of 4 dimensions (3d + time) that derives from a ""real"" existence that exists in a 5 dimensional ""membrane"" universe (much like a 3d object casts a 2d shadow). Cool stuff.Maybe I just need a bigger brain."

At least I honestly doubt it could be done without losing a significant portion of quality and precision.I don't know, I read too much about these kinds of things anyway so I guess I might not be right, it could be just what an intelligent layman without too much time needs.

The description of a black hole being mentioned explicitly in a Chapter of Qur'an known as Surah NajamWhen the stars are extinguished. (Qur'an, 77:8)[I swear] by Heaven and the Tariq! And what will convey to you what the Tariq is? The Star Piercing [the darkness]! (Qur'an, 86:1-3)For more visit the link below:https://www.islamicity.org/3517/some-...What is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?Time must have a beginning in what is called the big bang. Similar arguments show that time would have an end, when stars or galaxies collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.If one follows our past light cone back in time, it will be bent back by the matter in the early universe. The whole universe we observe is contained within a region whose boundary shrinks to zero at the big bang. This would be a singularity, a place where the density of matter would be infinite and classical general relativity would break down.While 10 or 11 dimensions don’t sound much like the spacetime we experience, the idea was that the other 6 or 7 dimensions are curled up so small that we don't notice them; we are only aware of the remaining 4 large and nearly flat dimensions. String theories are not of much use for describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curves the universe or forms a bound state, like a black hole. For these situations, one needs supergravity, which is basically Einstein's theory of curved spacetime with some extra kinds of matter.SpookyThe area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.Amazing>The most obvious thing about space is that it goes on and on and on. This has been confirmed by modern instruments such as the Hubble telescope, which allows us to probe deep into space. What we see are billions and billions of galaxies of various shapes and sizes. Each galaxy contains uncounted billions of stars, many of which have planets around them. We live on a planet orbiting a star in an outer arm of the spiral Milky Way galaxy.HubbleIt was Hubble who recognized the dramatic implications of this discovery: on the large scale, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. The universe is expanding.It came as a total surprise, and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe. If the galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer together in the past. From the present rate of expansion, we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed ten to fifteen billion years ago.THE BIG BANGEinstein's general theory of relativity implied that the universe and time itself must have had a beginning in a tremendous explosion.When the universe is big, as it is today, there are a very large number of rolls of the dice, and the results average out to something one can predict. That is why classical laws work for large systems. But when the universe is very small, as it was near in time to the big bang, there are only a small number of rolls of the dice, and the uncertainty principle is very important.The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behavior.Endless PossibilitiesThere seem to be various possibilities, depending on the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more than a certain critical amount, the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow them down and will eventually stop them from flying apart. They will then start falling toward each other and will all come together in a big crunch that will be the end of the history of the universe in real time.If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies from flying apart forever. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get increasingly emptier and colder. So, again, things will come to an end, but in a less dramatic way.When Copernicus and Galileo discovered that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth, and Newton discovered the laws that govern their motion, astrology became extremely implausible. Why should the positions of other planets against the background sky as seen from Earth have any correlations with the macromolecules on a minor planet that call themselves intelligent lifeAbsolute time defiedIn 1905, the concept of absolute time was overthrown by the special theory of relativity, in which time was no longer an independent quantity on its own but was just one direction in a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Dark StarsMichell argued that there could be stars that are much more massive than the Sun and have escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see these stars, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by the gravity of the star. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars and we now call black holes.The radiation from a black hole will carry away energy, which must mean that the black hole will lose mass and get smaller. In turn, this will mean that its temperature will rise and the rate of radiation will increase. Eventually the black hole will get down to zero mass. We don't know how to calculate what happens at this point, but the only natural, reasonable outcome would seem to be that the black hole disappears completely. So what happens then to the part of the wave function inside the black hole and the information it contains about what had fallen into the black hole?However, according to the picture of one member of a virtual-particle pair falling in and the other member escaping, one would not expect the escaping particle to be related to what fell in, or to carry away information about it. So the only answer would seem to be that the information in the part of the wave function inside the black hole gets lostP-branesAndrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa made an important advance. They chose to regard a black hole as being made up of a number of building blocks, called p-brane . Recall that one way of thinking about p-branes is as sheets that move through the three dimensions of space and also through seven extra dimensions that we don't notice.Does part of the wave function get lost down black holes, or does all the information get out again, as the p-brane model suggests? This is one of the outstanding questions in theoretical physics today.WORMHOLESBut you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out. So you might think that you could do something like blowing up the rocket on its launch pad to prevent your setting out in the first place. This is a variation of the grandfather paradox: what happens if you go back and kill your grandfather before your father was conceived?At present our computers remain outstripped in computational power by the brain of a humble earthworm.The brain does not have a single CPU— central processing unit—that processes each command in sequence. Rather, it has millions of processors working together at the same time. Such massively parallel processing will be the future for electronic intelligence as well.The human race has been in its present form for only two million years out of the fifteen billion years or so since the big bangA shocking reality check!Many of us may choose to live a virtual existence? Forming cyber-friendships and relationships!Funniest revelationIt is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war. So as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us.To the naked eye a hair looks like a line; its only dimension appears to be length. Similarly, spacetime may look four-dimensional to us, but appear ten- or eleven-dimensional when probed with very high-energy particles."

Approaching this book with a mild understanding of basic physics, I simply exhausted myself in his space-time, extra dimensions ""Nutshell"". The amount of energy it took to comprehend a fraction of what I read left me in a swirling vacuum fluctuation. It is an honor to have read Professor Hawking's book.

Reading about your UNIVERSE for the first time, in such a detailed explanation for what the writer aims to tell based on his wide knowledge in Quantum mechanics, theoretical physics and cosmology , necessarily requires a knowledgeable reader in the sciences I've just mentioned so he/she wouldn't be perplexed and then, he would get answers for many questions that may flash in his mind.In addition to the diverse information that one can get from reading this , he quietly doesn't get bored due to Hawking's sense of humor.

49,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157406-omar-ali,4,"SECTION: HERALD REVIEW/BooksFile: uni.docWords: 712By Omar AliWanted: Nutcracker	The number of books trying to explain science to the 'layman' has simply exploded in the last few years. But Professor Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, remains the biggest star in the field. although his first book, A Brief History of Time, sold over a million copies, Hawking is well aware that far too many readers never made it beyond the first few pages. So he says he set out to write ""a different kind of book that might be easier to understand."" Hawking's new book The Universe in a Nutshell is beautifully produced but breaks very little new ground, conveying little more than a 'take it on faith' explanation of what physicists think of the cosmos.	 The first two chapters introduce relativity and the problems of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. While the illustrations are some of the best you will ever see in a science book, there is almost no attempt to try and explain the reasoning that led Einstein to his revolutionary conclusions. These chapters provide a kind of general introduction to the subject and are followed by a series of essays on various aspects of modern cosmology. The discerning reader will come away with some vague understanding that modern physics has rejected the common sense views of time and space, that general relativity and quantum effects somehow need to be reconciled, that there is something very important called the ""uncertainty principle"", (even though it's not as uncertain as you thought: God may not know the position and the momentum of a particle to perfection, but he does know the wave function), black holes exist, naked singularities probably do not and it might all come down to strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions (but we can't really know for sure till we build a particle accelerator larger than the solar system). 	 The penultimate chapter has some interesting speculation about how life and intelligence may evolve in the future and the final chapter gives a very light introduction to M-theory, which seems to be Hawking's current favourite for a possible ""theory of everything"": one grand framework to explain the known universe, from big bang to big crunch and everything in between (though, like Robert Frost, physicists are still unsure if it will end in fire or in ice). 	Along the way, Hawking tells us several times that he is a positivist, which means he really can't say what all this ""means"", except that it is a mathematical model which fits observations and makes predictions that work. But this philosophical reticence seems at odds with a persistent hopefulness that the full explanation is around the corner. Why should we expect any such total understanding in the near future? Is it not more likely that in science, as in theology, we have only just begun? That our descendants may well see what we cannot even begin to imagine? And their descendants even further? 	The physicist Freeman Dyson has said: ""As a scientist, I live in a universe of overwhelming size and mystery. The mysteries of life and language, good and evil, chance and necessity, and of our own existence as conscious beings in an impersonal cosmos are even greater than the mysteries of physics and astronomy. Behind the mysteries that we can name, there are deeper mysteries that we have not even begun to explore"". It is this awareness that seems to be missing in Hawking's book. (One dare not think that it is missing from professor Hawking himself.) Ultimately, Universe in a Nutshell is a coffee table book that is not detailed enough to teach you anything original and yet far too complicated for many scientific illiterates to follow. But it may well serve as a good introduction and lead the reader to other books that do a better job of actually explaining the physics as well as other mysteries that extend far deeper. "

However, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book (where I can understand). I wouldn't dare to be the first to make that joke, but Professor Hawking joked that although he held Isaac Newton's chair as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, his is electric and Newton's was not. I will return to this book in the future once I have a better grasp on mathematics for theoretical physics; reading the theory in words alone doesn't help much. "

This illuminating and enlightening book takes one on the most thrilling venture through space and time, wherein extraordinary marvels lie in wait. The true genius of Stephen Hawking is something that cannot fail to surprise, as this book is filled with pages of diagrams and fantastically detailed images. The complexities, excentricities and ideas of such a man is brilliantly captured in every page, therefore you'll never quite regard space and the universe in the same way ever again. 'It's all a matter of where one places themselves in life's continuous timeline' Here are some of my favourite quotes that I gained inspiration from the book... What keeps one grounded inevitably is slow in its origin That which fluctuates in peaks and troughs isn't generally relative to the common norm 'Politics for the moment, but an equation for eternity!' --Albert Einstein'Nothing puzzles me like time and space. And yet nothing troubles me less than time and space, because i never think of them' --19th century author, Charles Lamb  A scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple observations and will make definite predictions that can be tested.  --FACT! Creation is hierachal like Dante's inferno, and we're all sinking with a gravitational pull! Time travel is possible with a vast imagination! Does one drift around in various areas (reflection), or move with the time's (progression)?  This book is essential reading for those budding scientists keen to understand more about are universe, as it's packed with fascinating facts from a true legend and clever mind. You may say that there are different expressions to explain the same underlying theory, which is true, however Hawking's is one of the easier to understand and the most informative. The universe in a nutshell guides you on the search to discover those hidden secrets beyond our stratosphere, such as; supersymetry, M-theory, holography and many more while combining other scientists imput. Ideas from Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Richard Feynman's histories are included all in this fantastic compendium of knowledge.

The future of computers and genetic engineering could bring us closer to unified theory of everything or maybe this all is a hallucination of the mind? The most fascinating part for me however was discussion of time. We all think we experience time. In everyday thinking, time is being reduced to a level of an individual- linear perception and chains of recalled mind experiences.

It might, repeat: might, have been possible to understand this material on a printed page, which in this case included a lot of nifty diagrams, on the presumption that repetition might have helped. But probably not. I did enjoy and generally understand the opening chapter in which Hawking explained the history of physics and our conception of the universe, with a beautiful presentation of the life and work of Einstein, and to a lesser extent his contemporaries and immediate intellectual followers. But after that, when Hawking moved into contemporary physics and the exploration of the cosmos (where he made his own contributions, mind you), I was mostly gasping for air, down for the count, you get the idea. Once I let go of the expectation that I could actually master the material, I kind of enjoyed the periodic appearance of concepts and phrases I had sort-of known about arrive in their natural and proper context, things like string theory, black holes, quanta, Heisenberg principle, nebula, etc. Perhaps more than anything, I enjoyed the ebulliance and delight with which Hawking presents his material, as if it is the simplest and most fun thing ever... which to him, it probably is."
63,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"Stephen Hawking, stated in, "" The Universe in a Nutshell"" that our history is filled with infinite potentiality and what we ""got” was due to disturbing the quantum field by our ""observations."" Profound, I thought, and pondered about his theory for months. To better understand Dr. Hawking's theory, I read everything on quantum physics I could understand and a pile of books on the brain, Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" was the most helpful. Below is what I believe correlates with Hawking's theory, It is from the book, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts, (Seth Material) I have included a quote and then how I am seeing life now through a magical lens. ""An examination of your conscious thoughts will tell you much about the state of your inner mind, your intentions and expectations, and will often lead you to a direct confrontation with challenges and problems. Your thoughts, studied , will let you see where you are going. They point clearly to the nature of physical events. What exists physically existed first in thought and feeling. There is no other rule.What if our ""observations"" were first feeling-tone shared by all consciousness focused in physical reality. The cells and organs have their own awarenesses, and a gestalt one. So the race of man also has individual consciousness and a gestalt or mass consciousness of which makes up our physical reality. While physical we follow physical laws, or assumptions. These form the framework for corporeal expression. Within this framework you have full freedom to create your experience, your personal life in all of its aspects; the living picture of the world, your personal life, and to some extent your individual living experience, helped create the world as it is known in your time.It is important before we continue that you realize that consciousness is within all physical phenomena, however. It is vital that you realize your position within nature. Nature is created from within. The personal life that you know rises up from within you, yet is given. period. Since you are part of Being, then in a certain fashion you give yourself the life that is being lived through you."" ~ Jane Roberts, Seth Material.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.” ― Stephen HawkingWhen I fully realized my entire reality was created by me, and global consciousness, I could chose what to give my attention to for the change I wanted to see. The more you examine your thoughts and feelings the more excited you'll get when what you were thinking about appears. You'll notice ""integrity"" plays a role as well, (even when no one but you knows what good things you've done), because it's ""liking yourself"" that is most important in your ability to thrive without limitations. It only works if you truly believe. Just like Yoda said, “there is no try, only do.”Whatever you hold in your consciousness you put in your reality. If you are thinking about something, it will appear in a similar form. Don't get scared when you notice you have a lot of negative thoughts, about yourself and the world. These types of ""thoughts"" are your current vibration, giving you the reality you have now. Any change towards better inner-feelings about yourself and your surroundings will show up immediately in a in an event confirming your power to create your reality. I am now excited about cleaning up my thoughts -especially my deep inner feelings that were not as great as I wanted them to be. Below are examples of limiting beliefs you may want to remove.Example of limiting thoughts:1. My behavior is hidden in my subconsciousness. 2. My life is a result of my childhood, or Karma, 3. Old age causes illness and regression. 4. People are out to screw me. Or People don't like me.5. I am not smart enough, good enough, someone is better than me.6. My religion is the right one, and so are my beliefs. 7. I have no control over the events in my life.8. I am fat.9. There is something wrong with money. People who have it are greedy, less spiritual than those who are poor. They are unhappier, and snobs.These are all beliefs held by many people. Those who have them will meet them in experience. Physical data will always seem to reinforce the beliefs, therefore, but the beliefs formed the reality.""The ego, which is ever changing based on a flow of new experiences looks out upon physical reality and surveys it in relation to those characteristics of which it is composed at any given time. It makes its judgments according to its own idea of itself."" ~Jane RobertsI try to catch myself in conversation making jokes about myself, and stop it. )When science has proven ""consciousness creates everything in our reality"" our focus will turn to beautiful stories, ideas and breathtaking environments. We will spot giving our attention to garbage news stories filled with violence and fear; because we don't believe what we hold these emotions in our consciousness mind. If I could ask Dr. Hawking one question it would be this:You said that we collapse waves when we observe an event. But what if-- our expectation collapsed the wave, our belief before the form existed. If this is true, consciousness is creating the collapsing of the field based on our inner-emotions, which would make the unpopular words, like ""emotions, feelings and insights"" the most valuable of all our senses. I learned most of my beliefs were secondhand and limiting, so I jumped those fences!I documented my journey in my memoir, ""From Hollywood to God,"" by Kelly Granite Enckhttp://www.amazon.com/From-Hollywood-...I am leaving the link for those, like me, who love to explore the Inner Journey of the Mind!Thanks Stephen for all your years of passion!

While many books on science do give valuable information, they fail to achieve the latter purpose, as mentioned earlier. This book however succeeds in achieving both.The Universe in a Nutshell is considered as a sequel to Hawking's previous bestseller, A Brief History of Time. The book, as the title suggests, discusses about the history and principles of the physical universe, in a nutshell. The topics are discussed in just the fair amount of detail and simplicity, although there are some topics which are just too advanced to understand.Despite being nearly 2 decades old, the book still holds it value, and readers can give it go if they are curious to know about the universe, but lack lots of free time."

Though it might sound silly, I'm more fond of his unique voice.After his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time in 80s, he wanted to propagandize the current frontier we're encountering but this time in a more brief way. The First two chapters serve as a prerequisite for proper understanding. Short but very well explained introductory concepts of Einstein-Relativity stuffs; Maybe because i used to read a lot of books in that subject (I've read more books on relativity than automobile engineering in which I've got a bachelor's recently).Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and its unification attempts with relativity at the initial conditions of the universe. Time and extra dimensions for the maintenance of consistencies. Some little dip in the chaos theory but too much idea regarding it in this book.Some chapters on his (and his colleagues) attempts on the formulations of the Quantum Gravity theory, then evolving into Super Gravity, then String theories and eventually m-theory atleast for now (Eventually is not the correct usage).Blackhole information paradox and the concepts of imaginary time are correlated to hinder the optimistic possibilities of Time Travel atleast for now. The Paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. I feel personally that this Part needs revisiting again. Even the simple terms and explanations, these are much more complex topics undergoing tedious *theoritical* research currently. He also reassures the readers sarcastically that this might be a part of government cover up for Time Travel Conspiracy; You get to know only when you get to meet one like HG Wells.What I can assure is, that one could get a better view on string theory based M-theory which currently has the higher chance to become the Theory of Everything and the concepts of brane worlds.

I was hoping it would be a ""dumbed down"" version of some of the high-end theoretical physics ideas that I haven't had the time or brain cells to keep up with.While I'm sure the content is dumbed down from Stephen Hawking's level, most of it is covered at a level and speed that kept it out of my comprehension. To be honest I find a lot of modern theories and ideas very skeptical - it almost seems to me that the theories are created and given weight because they might be possible... and that's good enough because to prove otherwise is incredibly difficult. A part of me (no doubt remnants of thinking left there by my college professors) downplays my pessimism and wants to believe them at face value. In this book I was looking to confirm that part, but it just didn't happen. There didn't seem to be any real explanations or support (or maybe it was above my head and I zoned out). It was simply describing the theories (e.g., M Theory) and presenting them as fact. (We used to call this ""hand waving"" in my Physics classes in college - like a magician's hand waving as misdirection.)There were a lot of good parts that were interesting and engaging. Near the end there was a part on the evolution of life on Earth and humans that was really intriguing. It had to do with DNA as a form of evolutionary method of saving data which has now been augmented by humans' ability to store information outside of our DNA now. And I do now have a better understanding of the framework on some modern theories (like multi-dimensions) that I didn't have before. I particularly liked coming to a better understanding of the theory of our perception of reality being a mere projection of 4 dimensions (3d + time) that derives from a ""real"" existence that exists in a 5 dimensional ""membrane"" universe (much like a 3d object casts a 2d shadow). Cool stuff.Maybe I just need a bigger brain."

At least I honestly doubt it could be done without losing a significant portion of quality and precision.I don't know, I read too much about these kinds of things anyway so I guess I might not be right, it could be just what an intelligent layman without too much time needs. But that's a big maybe. Try it, after all, I put 4 stars up there for a reason."

Furthermore, it was actually a relief that I could get a lot of the stuff in the book considering the fact that it is written by Hawking. I am glad I gave it a try. I will boldly explore science non-fiction from now on.As for the writing, his simple language coupled with complicated theories resulted in a good flow.

73,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42706900-mahira,4,"About Time TravelWhat really sparked my interest in time travel, was the ascension of The Prophet Mohammad, this makes him the first person to have traveled in time through a black hole. The description of a black hole being mentioned explicitly in a Chapter of Qur'an known as Surah NajamWhen the stars are extinguished. (Qur'an, 77:8)[I swear] by Heaven and the Tariq! And what will convey to you what the Tariq is? The Star Piercing [the darkness]! (Qur'an, 86:1-3)For more visit the link below:https://www.islamicity.org/3517/some-...What is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?Time must have a beginning in what is called the big bang. Similar arguments show that time would have an end, when stars or galaxies collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.If one follows our past light cone back in time, it will be bent back by the matter in the early universe. The whole universe we observe is contained within a region whose boundary shrinks to zero at the big bang. This would be a singularity, a place where the density of matter would be infinite and classical general relativity would break down.While 10 or 11 dimensions don’t sound much like the spacetime we experience, the idea was that the other 6 or 7 dimensions are curled up so small that we don't notice them; we are only aware of the remaining 4 large and nearly flat dimensions. String theories are not of much use for describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curves the universe or forms a bound state, like a black hole. For these situations, one needs supergravity, which is basically Einstein's theory of curved spacetime with some extra kinds of matter.SpookyThe area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.Amazing>The most obvious thing about space is that it goes on and on and on. This has been confirmed by modern instruments such as the Hubble telescope, which allows us to probe deep into space. What we see are billions and billions of galaxies of various shapes and sizes. Each galaxy contains uncounted billions of stars, many of which have planets around them. We live on a planet orbiting a star in an outer arm of the spiral Milky Way galaxy.HubbleIt was Hubble who recognized the dramatic implications of this discovery: on the large scale, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. The universe is expanding.It came as a total surprise, and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe. If the galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer together in the past. From the present rate of expansion, we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed ten to fifteen billion years ago.THE BIG BANGEinstein's general theory of relativity implied that the universe and time itself must have had a beginning in a tremendous explosion.When the universe is big, as it is today, there are a very large number of rolls of the dice, and the results average out to something one can predict. That is why classical laws work for large systems. But when the universe is very small, as it was near in time to the big bang, there are only a small number of rolls of the dice, and the uncertainty principle is very important.The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behavior.Endless PossibilitiesThere seem to be various possibilities, depending on the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more than a certain critical amount, the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow them down and will eventually stop them from flying apart. They will then start falling toward each other and will all come together in a big crunch that will be the end of the history of the universe in real time.If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies from flying apart forever. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get increasingly emptier and colder. So, again, things will come to an end, but in a less dramatic way.When Copernicus and Galileo discovered that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth, and Newton discovered the laws that govern their motion, astrology became extremely implausible. Why should the positions of other planets against the background sky as seen from Earth have any correlations with the macromolecules on a minor planet that call themselves intelligent lifeAbsolute time defiedIn 1905, the concept of absolute time was overthrown by the special theory of relativity, in which time was no longer an independent quantity on its own but was just one direction in a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Dark StarsMichell argued that there could be stars that are much more massive than the Sun and have escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see these stars, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by the gravity of the star. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars and we now call black holes.The radiation from a black hole will carry away energy, which must mean that the black hole will lose mass and get smaller. In turn, this will mean that its temperature will rise and the rate of radiation will increase. Eventually the black hole will get down to zero mass. We don't know how to calculate what happens at this point, but the only natural, reasonable outcome would seem to be that the black hole disappears completely. So what happens then to the part of the wave function inside the black hole and the information it contains about what had fallen into the black hole?However, according to the picture of one member of a virtual-particle pair falling in and the other member escaping, one would not expect the escaping particle to be related to what fell in, or to carry away information about it. So the only answer would seem to be that the information in the part of the wave function inside the black hole gets lostP-branesAndrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa made an important advance. They chose to regard a black hole as being made up of a number of building blocks, called p-brane . Recall that one way of thinking about p-branes is as sheets that move through the three dimensions of space and also through seven extra dimensions that we don't notice.Does part of the wave function get lost down black holes, or does all the information get out again, as the p-brane model suggests? This is one of the outstanding questions in theoretical physics today.WORMHOLESBut you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out. So you might think that you could do something like blowing up the rocket on its launch pad to prevent your setting out in the first place. This is a variation of the grandfather paradox: what happens if you go back and kill your grandfather before your father was conceived?At present our computers remain outstripped in computational power by the brain of a humble earthworm.The brain does not have a single CPU— central processing unit—that processes each command in sequence. Rather, it has millions of processors working together at the same time. Such massively parallel processing will be the future for electronic intelligence as well.The human race has been in its present form for only two million years out of the fifteen billion years or so since the big bangA shocking reality check!Many of us may choose to live a virtual existence? Forming cyber-friendships and relationships!Funniest revelationIt is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war. So as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us.To the naked eye a hair looks like a line; its only dimension appears to be length. Similarly, spacetime may look four-dimensional to us, but appear ten- or eleven-dimensional when probed with very high-energy particles."

79,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157406-omar-ali,4,"SECTION: HERALD REVIEW/BooksFile: uni.docWords: 712By Omar AliWanted: Nutcracker	The number of books trying to explain science to the 'layman' has simply exploded in the last few years. But Professor Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, remains the biggest star in the field. although his first book, A Brief History of Time, sold over a million copies, Hawking is well aware that far too many readers never made it beyond the first few pages. So he says he set out to write ""a different kind of book that might be easier to understand."" Hawking's new book The Universe in a Nutshell is beautifully produced but breaks very little new ground, conveying little more than a 'take it on faith' explanation of what physicists think of the cosmos.	 The first two chapters introduce relativity and the problems of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. While the illustrations are some of the best you will ever see in a science book, there is almost no attempt to try and explain the reasoning that led Einstein to his revolutionary conclusions. These chapters provide a kind of general introduction to the subject and are followed by a series of essays on various aspects of modern cosmology. The discerning reader will come away with some vague understanding that modern physics has rejected the common sense views of time and space, that general relativity and quantum effects somehow need to be reconciled, that there is something very important called the ""uncertainty principle"", (even though it's not as uncertain as you thought: God may not know the position and the momentum of a particle to perfection, but he does know the wave function), black holes exist, naked singularities probably do not and it might all come down to strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions (but we can't really know for sure till we build a particle accelerator larger than the solar system). 	 The penultimate chapter has some interesting speculation about how life and intelligence may evolve in the future and the final chapter gives a very light introduction to M-theory, which seems to be Hawking's current favourite for a possible ""theory of everything"": one grand framework to explain the known universe, from big bang to big crunch and everything in between (though, like Robert Frost, physicists are still unsure if it will end in fire or in ice). 	Along the way, Hawking tells us several times that he is a positivist, which means he really can't say what all this ""means"", except that it is a mathematical model which fits observations and makes predictions that work. But this philosophical reticence seems at odds with a persistent hopefulness that the full explanation is around the corner. Why should we expect any such total understanding in the near future? Is it not more likely that in science, as in theology, we have only just begun? That our descendants may well see what we cannot even begin to imagine? And their descendants even further? 	The physicist Freeman Dyson has said: ""As a scientist, I live in a universe of overwhelming size and mystery. The mysteries of life and language, good and evil, chance and necessity, and of our own existence as conscious beings in an impersonal cosmos are even greater than the mysteries of physics and astronomy. Behind the mysteries that we can name, there are deeper mysteries that we have not even begun to explore"". It is this awareness that seems to be missing in Hawking's book. (One dare not think that it is missing from professor Hawking himself.) Ultimately, Universe in a Nutshell is a coffee table book that is not detailed enough to teach you anything original and yet far too complicated for many scientific illiterates to follow. But it may well serve as a good introduction and lead the reader to other books that do a better job of actually explaining the physics as well as other mysteries that extend far deeper. "

However, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book (where I can understand). I wouldn't dare to be the first to make that joke, but Professor Hawking joked that although he held Isaac Newton's chair as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, his is electric and Newton's was not. I will return to this book in the future once I have a better grasp on mathematics for theoretical physics; reading the theory in words alone doesn't help much. "

This illuminating and enlightening book takes one on the most thrilling venture through space and time, wherein extraordinary marvels lie in wait. The true genius of Stephen Hawking is something that cannot fail to surprise, as this book is filled with pages of diagrams and fantastically detailed images. The complexities, excentricities and ideas of such a man is brilliantly captured in every page, therefore you'll never quite regard space and the universe in the same way ever again. 'It's all a matter of where one places themselves in life's continuous timeline' Here are some of my favourite quotes that I gained inspiration from the book... What keeps one grounded inevitably is slow in its origin That which fluctuates in peaks and troughs isn't generally relative to the common norm 'Politics for the moment, but an equation for eternity!' --Albert Einstein'Nothing puzzles me like time and space. And yet nothing troubles me less than time and space, because i never think of them' --19th century author, Charles Lamb  A scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple observations and will make definite predictions that can be tested.  --FACT! Creation is hierachal like Dante's inferno, and we're all sinking with a gravitational pull! Time travel is possible with a vast imagination! Does one drift around in various areas (reflection), or move with the time's (progression)?  This book is essential reading for those budding scientists keen to understand more about are universe, as it's packed with fascinating facts from a true legend and clever mind. You may say that there are different expressions to explain the same underlying theory, which is true, however Hawking's is one of the easier to understand and the most informative. The universe in a nutshell guides you on the search to discover those hidden secrets beyond our stratosphere, such as; supersymetry, M-theory, holography and many more while combining other scientists imput. Ideas from Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Richard Feynman's histories are included all in this fantastic compendium of knowledge.

The future of computers and genetic engineering could bring us closer to unified theory of everything or maybe this all is a hallucination of the mind? The most fascinating part for me however was discussion of time. We all think we experience time. In everyday thinking, time is being reduced to a level of an individual- linear perception and chains of recalled mind experiences.

It might, repeat: might, have been possible to understand this material on a printed page, which in this case included a lot of nifty diagrams, on the presumption that repetition might have helped. But probably not. I did enjoy and generally understand the opening chapter in which Hawking explained the history of physics and our conception of the universe, with a beautiful presentation of the life and work of Einstein, and to a lesser extent his contemporaries and immediate intellectual followers. But after that, when Hawking moved into contemporary physics and the exploration of the cosmos (where he made his own contributions, mind you), I was mostly gasping for air, down for the count, you get the idea. Once I let go of the expectation that I could actually master the material, I kind of enjoyed the periodic appearance of concepts and phrases I had sort-of known about arrive in their natural and proper context, things like string theory, black holes, quanta, Heisenberg principle, nebula, etc. Perhaps more than anything, I enjoyed the ebulliance and delight with which Hawking presents his material, as if it is the simplest and most fun thing ever... which to him, it probably is."
93,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"Stephen Hawking, stated in, "" The Universe in a Nutshell"" that our history is filled with infinite potentiality and what we ""got” was due to disturbing the quantum field by our ""observations."" Profound, I thought, and pondered about his theory for months. To better understand Dr. Hawking's theory, I read everything on quantum physics I could understand and a pile of books on the brain, Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" was the most helpful. Below is what I believe correlates with Hawking's theory, It is from the book, The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts, (Seth Material) I have included a quote and then how I am seeing life now through a magical lens. ""An examination of your conscious thoughts will tell you much about the state of your inner mind, your intentions and expectations, and will often lead you to a direct confrontation with challenges and problems. Your thoughts, studied , will let you see where you are going. They point clearly to the nature of physical events. What exists physically existed first in thought and feeling. There is no other rule.What if our ""observations"" were first feeling-tone shared by all consciousness focused in physical reality. The cells and organs have their own awarenesses, and a gestalt one. So the race of man also has individual consciousness and a gestalt or mass consciousness of which makes up our physical reality. While physical we follow physical laws, or assumptions. These form the framework for corporeal expression. Within this framework you have full freedom to create your experience, your personal life in all of its aspects; the living picture of the world, your personal life, and to some extent your individual living experience, helped create the world as it is known in your time.It is important before we continue that you realize that consciousness is within all physical phenomena, however. It is vital that you realize your position within nature. Nature is created from within. The personal life that you know rises up from within you, yet is given. period. Since you are part of Being, then in a certain fashion you give yourself the life that is being lived through you."" ~ Jane Roberts, Seth Material.“Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.” ― Stephen HawkingWhen I fully realized my entire reality was created by me, and global consciousness, I could chose what to give my attention to for the change I wanted to see. The more you examine your thoughts and feelings the more excited you'll get when what you were thinking about appears. You'll notice ""integrity"" plays a role as well, (even when no one but you knows what good things you've done), because it's ""liking yourself"" that is most important in your ability to thrive without limitations. It only works if you truly believe. Just like Yoda said, “there is no try, only do.”Whatever you hold in your consciousness you put in your reality. If you are thinking about something, it will appear in a similar form. Don't get scared when you notice you have a lot of negative thoughts, about yourself and the world. These types of ""thoughts"" are your current vibration, giving you the reality you have now. Any change towards better inner-feelings about yourself and your surroundings will show up immediately in a in an event confirming your power to create your reality. I am now excited about cleaning up my thoughts -especially my deep inner feelings that were not as great as I wanted them to be. Below are examples of limiting beliefs you may want to remove.Example of limiting thoughts:1. My behavior is hidden in my subconsciousness. 2. My life is a result of my childhood, or Karma, 3. Old age causes illness and regression. 4. People are out to screw me. Or People don't like me.5. I am not smart enough, good enough, someone is better than me.6. My religion is the right one, and so are my beliefs. 7. I have no control over the events in my life.8. I am fat.9. There is something wrong with money. People who have it are greedy, less spiritual than those who are poor. They are unhappier, and snobs.These are all beliefs held by many people. Those who have them will meet them in experience. Physical data will always seem to reinforce the beliefs, therefore, but the beliefs formed the reality.""The ego, which is ever changing based on a flow of new experiences looks out upon physical reality and surveys it in relation to those characteristics of which it is composed at any given time. It makes its judgments according to its own idea of itself."" ~Jane RobertsI try to catch myself in conversation making jokes about myself, and stop it. )When science has proven ""consciousness creates everything in our reality"" our focus will turn to beautiful stories, ideas and breathtaking environments. We will spot giving our attention to garbage news stories filled with violence and fear; because we don't believe what we hold these emotions in our consciousness mind. If I could ask Dr. Hawking one question it would be this:You said that we collapse waves when we observe an event. But what if-- our expectation collapsed the wave, our belief before the form existed. If this is true, consciousness is creating the collapsing of the field based on our inner-emotions, which would make the unpopular words, like ""emotions, feelings and insights"" the most valuable of all our senses. I learned most of my beliefs were secondhand and limiting, so I jumped those fences!I documented my journey in my memoir, ""From Hollywood to God,"" by Kelly Granite Enckhttp://www.amazon.com/From-Hollywood-...I am leaving the link for those, like me, who love to explore the Inner Journey of the Mind!Thanks Stephen for all your years of passion!

While many books on science do give valuable information, they fail to achieve the latter purpose, as mentioned earlier. This book however succeeds in achieving both.The Universe in a Nutshell is considered as a sequel to Hawking's previous bestseller, A Brief History of Time. The book, as the title suggests, discusses about the history and principles of the physical universe, in a nutshell. The topics are discussed in just the fair amount of detail and simplicity, although there are some topics which are just too advanced to understand.Despite being nearly 2 decades old, the book still holds it value, and readers can give it go if they are curious to know about the universe, but lack lots of free time."

Though it might sound silly, I'm more fond of his unique voice.After his international bestseller, A Brief History of Time in 80s, he wanted to propagandize the current frontier we're encountering but this time in a more brief way. The First two chapters serve as a prerequisite for proper understanding. Short but very well explained introductory concepts of Einstein-Relativity stuffs; Maybe because i used to read a lot of books in that subject (I've read more books on relativity than automobile engineering in which I've got a bachelor's recently).Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and its unification attempts with relativity at the initial conditions of the universe. Time and extra dimensions for the maintenance of consistencies. Some little dip in the chaos theory but too much idea regarding it in this book.Some chapters on his (and his colleagues) attempts on the formulations of the Quantum Gravity theory, then evolving into Super Gravity, then String theories and eventually m-theory atleast for now (Eventually is not the correct usage).Blackhole information paradox and the concepts of imaginary time are correlated to hinder the optimistic possibilities of Time Travel atleast for now. The Paradox is a puzzle resulting from the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. I feel personally that this Part needs revisiting again. Even the simple terms and explanations, these are much more complex topics undergoing tedious *theoritical* research currently. He also reassures the readers sarcastically that this might be a part of government cover up for Time Travel Conspiracy; You get to know only when you get to meet one like HG Wells.What I can assure is, that one could get a better view on string theory based M-theory which currently has the higher chance to become the Theory of Everything and the concepts of brane worlds.

I was hoping it would be a ""dumbed down"" version of some of the high-end theoretical physics ideas that I haven't had the time or brain cells to keep up with.While I'm sure the content is dumbed down from Stephen Hawking's level, most of it is covered at a level and speed that kept it out of my comprehension. To be honest I find a lot of modern theories and ideas very skeptical - it almost seems to me that the theories are created and given weight because they might be possible... and that's good enough because to prove otherwise is incredibly difficult. A part of me (no doubt remnants of thinking left there by my college professors) downplays my pessimism and wants to believe them at face value. In this book I was looking to confirm that part, but it just didn't happen. There didn't seem to be any real explanations or support (or maybe it was above my head and I zoned out). It was simply describing the theories (e.g., M Theory) and presenting them as fact. (We used to call this ""hand waving"" in my Physics classes in college - like a magician's hand waving as misdirection.)There were a lot of good parts that were interesting and engaging. Near the end there was a part on the evolution of life on Earth and humans that was really intriguing. It had to do with DNA as a form of evolutionary method of saving data which has now been augmented by humans' ability to store information outside of our DNA now. And I do now have a better understanding of the framework on some modern theories (like multi-dimensions) that I didn't have before. I particularly liked coming to a better understanding of the theory of our perception of reality being a mere projection of 4 dimensions (3d + time) that derives from a ""real"" existence that exists in a 5 dimensional ""membrane"" universe (much like a 3d object casts a 2d shadow). Cool stuff.Maybe I just need a bigger brain."

At least I honestly doubt it could be done without losing a significant portion of quality and precision.I don't know, I read too much about these kinds of things anyway so I guess I might not be right, it could be just what an intelligent layman without too much time needs. But that's a big maybe. Try it, after all, I put 4 stars up there for a reason."

Furthermore, it was actually a relief that I could get a lot of the stuff in the book considering the fact that it is written by Hawking. I am glad I gave it a try. I will boldly explore science non-fiction from now on.As for the writing, his simple language coupled with complicated theories resulted in a good flow. There is occasional intelligent humour that makes you chuckle in delight and subtle satire that helps you connect with Hawking."

The description of a black hole being mentioned explicitly in a Chapter of Qur'an known as Surah NajamWhen the stars are extinguished. (Qur'an, 77:8)[I swear] by Heaven and the Tariq! And what will convey to you what the Tariq is? The Star Piercing [the darkness]! (Qur'an, 86:1-3)For more visit the link below:https://www.islamicity.org/3517/some-...What is real and what is imaginary? Is the distinction just in our minds?Time must have a beginning in what is called the big bang. Similar arguments show that time would have an end, when stars or galaxies collapse under their own gravity to form black holes.If one follows our past light cone back in time, it will be bent back by the matter in the early universe. The whole universe we observe is contained within a region whose boundary shrinks to zero at the big bang. This would be a singularity, a place where the density of matter would be infinite and classical general relativity would break down.While 10 or 11 dimensions don’t sound much like the spacetime we experience, the idea was that the other 6 or 7 dimensions are curled up so small that we don't notice them; we are only aware of the remaining 4 large and nearly flat dimensions. String theories are not of much use for describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curves the universe or forms a bound state, like a black hole. For these situations, one needs supergravity, which is basically Einstein's theory of curved spacetime with some extra kinds of matter.SpookyThe area formula for the entropy—or number of internal states—of a black hole suggests that information about what falls into a black hole may be stored like that on a record, and played back as the black hole evaporates.Amazing>The most obvious thing about space is that it goes on and on and on. This has been confirmed by modern instruments such as the Hubble telescope, which allows us to probe deep into space. What we see are billions and billions of galaxies of various shapes and sizes. Each galaxy contains uncounted billions of stars, many of which have planets around them. We live on a planet orbiting a star in an outer arm of the spiral Milky Way galaxy.HubbleIt was Hubble who recognized the dramatic implications of this discovery: on the large scale, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. The universe is expanding.It came as a total surprise, and it completely changed the discussion of the origin of the universe. If the galaxies are moving apart, they must have been closer together in the past. From the present rate of expansion, we can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed ten to fifteen billion years ago.THE BIG BANGEinstein's general theory of relativity implied that the universe and time itself must have had a beginning in a tremendous explosion.When the universe is big, as it is today, there are a very large number of rolls of the dice, and the results average out to something one can predict. That is why classical laws work for large systems. But when the universe is very small, as it was near in time to the big bang, there are only a small number of rolls of the dice, and the uncertainty principle is very important.The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behavior.Endless PossibilitiesThere seem to be various possibilities, depending on the amount of matter in the universe. If there is more than a certain critical amount, the gravitational attraction between the galaxies will slow them down and will eventually stop them from flying apart. They will then start falling toward each other and will all come together in a big crunch that will be the end of the history of the universe in real time.If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies from flying apart forever. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get increasingly emptier and colder. So, again, things will come to an end, but in a less dramatic way.When Copernicus and Galileo discovered that the planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth, and Newton discovered the laws that govern their motion, astrology became extremely implausible. Why should the positions of other planets against the background sky as seen from Earth have any correlations with the macromolecules on a minor planet that call themselves intelligent lifeAbsolute time defiedIn 1905, the concept of absolute time was overthrown by the special theory of relativity, in which time was no longer an independent quantity on its own but was just one direction in a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime.Dark StarsMichell argued that there could be stars that are much more massive than the Sun and have escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see these stars, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by the gravity of the star. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars and we now call black holes.The radiation from a black hole will carry away energy, which must mean that the black hole will lose mass and get smaller. In turn, this will mean that its temperature will rise and the rate of radiation will increase. Eventually the black hole will get down to zero mass. We don't know how to calculate what happens at this point, but the only natural, reasonable outcome would seem to be that the black hole disappears completely. So what happens then to the part of the wave function inside the black hole and the information it contains about what had fallen into the black hole?However, according to the picture of one member of a virtual-particle pair falling in and the other member escaping, one would not expect the escaping particle to be related to what fell in, or to carry away information about it. So the only answer would seem to be that the information in the part of the wave function inside the black hole gets lostP-branesAndrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa made an important advance. They chose to regard a black hole as being made up of a number of building blocks, called p-brane . Recall that one way of thinking about p-branes is as sheets that move through the three dimensions of space and also through seven extra dimensions that we don't notice.Does part of the wave function get lost down black holes, or does all the information get out again, as the p-brane model suggests? This is one of the outstanding questions in theoretical physics today.WORMHOLESBut you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out. So you might think that you could do something like blowing up the rocket on its launch pad to prevent your setting out in the first place. This is a variation of the grandfather paradox: what happens if you go back and kill your grandfather before your father was conceived?At present our computers remain outstripped in computational power by the brain of a humble earthworm.The brain does not have a single CPU— central processing unit—that processes each command in sequence. Rather, it has millions of processors working together at the same time. Such massively parallel processing will be the future for electronic intelligence as well.The human race has been in its present form for only two million years out of the fifteen billion years or so since the big bangA shocking reality check!Many of us may choose to live a virtual existence? Forming cyber-friendships and relationships!Funniest revelationIt is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war. So as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us.To the naked eye a hair looks like a line; its only dimension appears to be length. Similarly, spacetime may look four-dimensional to us, but appear ten- or eleven-dimensional when probed with very high-energy particles."

109,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157406-omar-ali,4,"SECTION: HERALD REVIEW/BooksFile: uni.docWords: 712By Omar AliWanted: Nutcracker	The number of books trying to explain science to the 'layman' has simply exploded in the last few years. But Professor Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, remains the biggest star in the field. although his first book, A Brief History of Time, sold over a million copies, Hawking is well aware that far too many readers never made it beyond the first few pages. So he says he set out to write ""a different kind of book that might be easier to understand."" Hawking's new book The Universe in a Nutshell is beautifully produced but breaks very little new ground, conveying little more than a 'take it on faith' explanation of what physicists think of the cosmos.	 The first two chapters introduce relativity and the problems of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. While the illustrations are some of the best you will ever see in a science book, there is almost no attempt to try and explain the reasoning that led Einstein to his revolutionary conclusions. These chapters provide a kind of general introduction to the subject and are followed by a series of essays on various aspects of modern cosmology. The discerning reader will come away with some vague understanding that modern physics has rejected the common sense views of time and space, that general relativity and quantum effects somehow need to be reconciled, that there is something very important called the ""uncertainty principle"", (even though it's not as uncertain as you thought: God may not know the position and the momentum of a particle to perfection, but he does know the wave function), black holes exist, naked singularities probably do not and it might all come down to strings that vibrate in 10 or 11 dimensions (but we can't really know for sure till we build a particle accelerator larger than the solar system). 	 The penultimate chapter has some interesting speculation about how life and intelligence may evolve in the future and the final chapter gives a very light introduction to M-theory, which seems to be Hawking's current favourite for a possible ""theory of everything"": one grand framework to explain the known universe, from big bang to big crunch and everything in between (though, like Robert Frost, physicists are still unsure if it will end in fire or in ice). 	Along the way, Hawking tells us several times that he is a positivist, which means he really can't say what all this ""means"", except that it is a mathematical model which fits observations and makes predictions that work. But this philosophical reticence seems at odds with a persistent hopefulness that the full explanation is around the corner. Why should we expect any such total understanding in the near future? Is it not more likely that in science, as in theology, we have only just begun? That our descendants may well see what we cannot even begin to imagine? And their descendants even further? 	The physicist Freeman Dyson has said: ""As a scientist, I live in a universe of overwhelming size and mystery. The mysteries of life and language, good and evil, chance and necessity, and of our own existence as conscious beings in an impersonal cosmos are even greater than the mysteries of physics and astronomy. Behind the mysteries that we can name, there are deeper mysteries that we have not even begun to explore"". It is this awareness that seems to be missing in Hawking's book. (One dare not think that it is missing from professor Hawking himself.) Ultimately, Universe in a Nutshell is a coffee table book that is not detailed enough to teach you anything original and yet far too complicated for many scientific illiterates to follow. But it may well serve as a good introduction and lead the reader to other books that do a better job of actually explaining the physics as well as other mysteries that extend far deeper. "

However, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book (where I can understand). I wouldn't dare to be the first to make that joke, but Professor Hawking joked that although he held Isaac Newton's chair as a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, his is electric and Newton's was not. I will return to this book in the future once I have a better grasp on mathematics for theoretical physics; reading the theory in words alone doesn't help much. "

This illuminating and enlightening book takes one on the most thrilling venture through space and time, wherein extraordinary marvels lie in wait. The true genius of Stephen Hawking is something that cannot fail to surprise, as this book is filled with pages of diagrams and fantastically detailed images. The complexities, excentricities and ideas of such a man is brilliantly captured in every page, therefore you'll never quite regard space and the universe in the same way ever again. 'It's all a matter of where one places themselves in life's continuous timeline' Here are some of my favourite quotes that I gained inspiration from the book... What keeps one grounded inevitably is slow in its origin That which fluctuates in peaks and troughs isn't generally relative to the common norm 'Politics for the moment, but an equation for eternity!' --Albert Einstein'Nothing puzzles me like time and space. And yet nothing troubles me less than time and space, because i never think of them' --19th century author, Charles Lamb  A scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple observations and will make definite predictions that can be tested.  --FACT! Creation is hierachal like Dante's inferno, and we're all sinking with a gravitational pull! Time travel is possible with a vast imagination! Does one drift around in various areas (reflection), or move with the time's (progression)?  This book is essential reading for those budding scientists keen to understand more about are universe, as it's packed with fascinating facts from a true legend and clever mind. You may say that there are different expressions to explain the same underlying theory, which is true, however Hawking's is one of the easier to understand and the most informative. The universe in a nutshell guides you on the search to discover those hidden secrets beyond our stratosphere, such as; supersymetry, M-theory, holography and many more while combining other scientists imput. Ideas from Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Richard Feynman's histories are included all in this fantastic compendium of knowledge.

The idea behind it -other than making a lit of money- according o the author is to explore some of the topic that were put in late chapters in the aforementioned book that were perhaps not read as well as sharing the later scientific discoveries (the first book was published in 1988, this one in 2001).Just as the first book the Hawking writings in general, the book is mostly easy to understand although it is not as good. In it he takles the follow tooics/questions: Einstein and the theories of special and general relativity, cosmological constant, What is time, String theory, Blackhole radiation, Time travel, Scientific discoveries in the early 20th century such as the existence of other galaxies and Expanding universe, Feyman's interpretation of quantum physics, Does the universe have a beginning or is it infinite?, The anthropic principle, History and future of the universeAstrology and future prediction, Scientific Determinism and uncertainty principle, Blackholes and predictions, Wormholes, Future of humanity, M theory, dark matter, artificial intelligence and Gravitational waves."

117,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19850739-julia-reim,5,This was a very compact version of the physics that surround our universe. Understandable for everyone and highly interesting. I would totally recommend it 
118,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83022104-di-na,4,"The book is an attempt to explain the nature of the universe using (mainly) String theory. Hawking is making assumptions along the way while discussing problems of quantum gravity, quantum physics and Einstein’s general relativity. Starting with superstring theory, P-Branes theory and arbitrary time, Hawkins conclude that our universe holds many hidden dimensions impossible for us to observe. The future of computers and genetic engineering could bring us closer to unified theory of everything or maybe this all is a hallucination of the mind? The most fascinating part for me however was discussion of time. We all think we experience time. In everyday thinking, time is being reduced to a level of an individual- linear perception and chains of recalled mind experiences. And here comes my personal admiration for Hawking trying to discuss universal time while dissolving individual perception of the mind. To say, trying to take a look on the universe with a God’s eye "
119,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881076-robert-cox,3,"As I renew my quest to dominate the world of casual physics, I am again met with the intellectually formidable presence of Stephen Hawkings. This actually has to be my least favorite of the Hawkings authored physics lite book, its lacks the accessibility that the other books inexorably maintained. My Astronomy 101 class (as always) proved integral to my understanding of the mysteries of the universe. I do however respect that Hawking appears to be the dude that can write about science without dragging religion into it unduly. It appears in this work but you can tell he doesn't study science to attack some vengeful God of his youth. Read the Brief/Briefers first. If u like dem reed dis. "

And that is my review in a nutshell. "
121,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25672215-anamarija,3," I feel kinda bad critiqueing Stephen Hawking, but this book felt like a mess. The ideas weren't really properly explained, it was mostly just: ""Oh, me and Penrose, we proved that..."" and he just tells us what they proved but there is no story behind the ideas, nothing feels personal or enthusiastic, whatever. It also makes it harder to read because that's boring. Also I feel like he wanted to explain too much too fast so the book doesn't feel unified. The illustrations are amazing tho."
122,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100040541-mustafa-jawad,4,"This is one of the more complex of Hawking's writings. String theory, time travel, and general relativity are not easy to wrap your head around. But Hawking explains it much better than any other author I've read.This version also includes pictures and diagrams, which aid in understanding, as if Hawking's rhetoric wasn't good enough.I won't recommend this to someone who wants to get into science for the first time, but this is great if you're interested in string theory, M theory and general relativity; especially if you're a fan of Stephen Hawking."

Hawking also writes that matter and energy decouple after the big bang. Off hand, this seems to say that underlying matter and energy in the pre-big bang moment there is just one thing.

Overall, it was a decent book and I'd recommend it for any science enthusiastic with a non-physics background. Yet, the thing is, books like these slowly get outdated just because of new incoming data. Particle physicists have explored and found many interesting things in LHC. Gravitational wave detections created many opportunities to further our understanding of black holes and other supermassive objects. Hot science topics that are very relevant to the context of this book. Now I'm wondering how this book would change after all these things."

The ideas weren't really properly explained, it was mostly just: ""Oh, me and Penrose, we proved that..."" and he just tells us what they proved but there is no story behind the ideas, nothing feels personal or enthusiastic, whatever. It also makes it harder to read because that's boring. Also I feel like he wanted to explain too much too fast so the book doesn't feel unified. The illustrations are amazing tho."

Since the book publication, LIGO and LHC produced a number of gravitational, particle discoveries, actually raising some more questions in the process, for supersymmetry, hierarchy question, extension of standard model, but that doesn't diminish anything of its value. On the contrary. Keep curious."

Despite Hawkings efforts, this book was not particularly digestible or friendly to the average reader. It’s not his fault that the concepts he explained were baffling, but I found this book more esoteric than A Brief History of Time even though he was attempting to accomplish the opposite. The latter half of the book focused on more recent developments in Physics and felt so theoretical and removed from reality that I lost interest. The former half, however, provided an interesting history of relativity and quantum theory. First three chapters were for sure the best."

There are more pictures and diagrams, but the narrative is overly abbreviated or unclear. Other books by other writers do a better job of describing the same material (and even Hawking's own theoretical contributions).There are a few observations in this book that stood out as ways of conveying difficult concepts. Spacetime is best viewed not as passive background, for example, but as an active participant ""in the dynamics of the universe."" He makes it clear that there is vacuum energy in space and that it corresponds to matter (with gravitational effects), per Einstein's formula that equates matter and energy. In his glossary, Hawking gives a good definition of mass (quantity of matter in a body, which is it's inertia or resistance to acceleration). Hawking also writes that matter and energy decouple after the big bang. Off hand, this seems to say that underlying matter and energy in the pre-big bang moment there is just one thing. Or, alternatively, he may be saying that ""raw"" energy is the most basic constituent in the universe and that matter flows out of it (after initial cooling), eventually allowing the formation of inorganic (quarks, atoms, molecules) and then, organic compounds. If the latter, this also implies that there is a significant directionality and identity (i.e., what combines with what, and how) that lies at the cosmic core.At the end of this book, Hawking strays a bit by saying that human intelligence is defined by brain size, which makes one wonder about Neanderthals, whales and elephants, and he predicts that after a couple of decades, the computer will be as complex as the human brain. "
256,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42270195-ishmael,4,"This book is aesthetic perfection. It really stands out from the crowd. Try holding a copy in your own hands - it practically calls out to be read. And that's just the front cover. The illustrations that grace every page are remarkable because they manage to explain, with complete lucidity, exactly what the words in the text can't quite say, and yet also bring a smile to my face in a way that I doubted Relativity ever would during my school years. Stephen Hawking is a great guide in the world of popular science. The subject matter isn't easy. In fact, at first glance, it seems so impenetrable that understanding it would be like escaping from a black hole (once you've passed the event horizon). However, he leads the reader through a series of logical steps, with enough interesting asides and amusing anecdotes that it doesn't become just another textbook. He also isn't afraid to think about the really interesting topics, such as time travel, which I though was admirable. One point I would make - it is described as the sequel to A Brief History of Time. However, I would personally recommend reading this one first. Many of the concepts are the same, and the exquisite illustrations make them more easily understandable. "

Open your imagination if you read this book, because you will need it. As Hawkins quotes his good friend and collegue whose name eludes me at the moment, science is imagination in a strait jacket. I couldn't agree more and noticed this very fact in my experiences in the field of science. The best scientist (or at least most likely to be ground breaking) seem to have a bit of a creative bent coupled with imagination. Although Hawkins spares us the details of the bindings, he allows us to enter into the world of imagination required for grasping the implications of modern day theoretical physics. "

280,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
281,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
282,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
283,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."

This current book was meant to sidestep that matter and in doing so he lost a star with me.If you are not familiar with the material already, the book is going to seem like it is moving too quickly. You are taking for granted that the author is correct, or at least giving a balanced view of the subject. This is what I normally call a ""little old lady"" book. A little old lady wants to cross the street, so the author kindly takes her hand and leads her across. He is not trying to teach her how to cross the street on her own. He doesn't explain the red and green lights, pushing the pedestrian cross button, so that next time she could cross by herself. He just leads her across. That is both good and bad. Your mileage may vary.Personally I think folks should read A Brief History of Time. It contains most of the same material, better explained.I will probably read this book again to review the knowledge I already have, but not to gain further knowledge."

However, I missed a lot of the previous storytelling and at some points I felt like reading a heavy academic book. The idea of indexing images to help explain some main concepts is pleasant to me, but some of them are just graphically hard to admire, to be honest. Talking about the bright side, Stephen is a great writer and always makes me wonder about how small our existence in this world is compared to the beginning of the universe and how everything is so fragile and ephemeral. The parts where he explains the expansion of the universe, the possibility of time travel through wormholes, and when he describes some provoking points about the future of human race were the highlights of this book. The reason I gave it 3 stars is not because it presents complex theories that are much harder to keep up than the previous book, but due to using repetition hoping it would help us understand some concepts that are misplaced, telling 1000 things almost grasping for air. The book felt like it had much more than just one author, maybe because they were looking for another bestseller, losing its previous storytelling and with a very weird closure.

I therefore found Stephen Hawking’s The Universe in a Nutshell very illuminating, clearly defining some of the concepts I had come across in SF books (singularities, black holes, dark matter), but also introducing me to many I had only heard about in passing (superstring theory, P-branes).I would have liked to read an updated, more recent version of it, as some of the chapters left me wondering what progress has been made in the field in the last nearly twenty years since the book came out. I also felt that at times Stephen Hawking, as a supporter of certain theories, failed to give a complete view of a subject, presenting instead the theories he thought valid. That’s to be expected since he was a practicing physicist I suppose, but it did make me curious about what other theories might be out there.

It's pointed out in this book that he had just stumbled upon some natural laws and that he should not be solely blamed for the existence of nuclear weapons. Also, this book illustrates a plain example of how ignorance can put a halt to science. Einstein left Germany just before the Nazi hunt for Jewish scientists began. If there had been no hateful Nazi party, more progress might have been made and a European atomic bomb may have been created earlier on. Progress was lost as a direct consequence of ignorance and unfounded hatred."

Most of reason is my lacking knowledge in physics then most of time i read this book i moved between Partially understand to Totally not understand.I tried to understand this book in most common and reasonable way that I can.Funny is even though it’s hard to read and even in Vietnamese I still dont understand what I am reading I still read and enjoy it. It raise me more interest in time, universe even more, this book also help me to enlarge my knowledge, theory of everything, how universe run and universe structures which lead to theory that the space- time we are living is just 3 dimension space but it can be up to 10 dimensions, just like layers after layers but maybe layer is too small to see or feel it. There are so may theories about universe, black hole or time-space which makes me feel overwhelmed and excited at the same time. This book is short, that’s kind of textbook which contains a vast of knowledge about universe and space and time which illustrate universe with images and theories attached.I suddenly want to tell my old friend that I read this book and intend to move to Elon Musk book which is 2 or 3 years ago i would never think I would read that kind of book in the future. Somehow right now i enjoy reading that kind of book."
290,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70654169-nathan-meyers,5,"In commemoration of the passing of one of the best minds of our century, Stephen Hawking, I decided that I would read some of his work. I can tell you that he is indeed one of the best minds and that this book is really good. I rated the book 5 stars because it was one of the most interesting and mind bending books I have read in a while. This book, The Universe in a Nutshell, was written by Stephen Hawking for the intent of explaining the universe on much simpler terms. He does an excellent job at explaining almost impossible concepts to grasp like the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He does it in a way that allows the average person to have a brief understanding and knowledge on the subjects. There is a reason why it is a New York Times Bestseller and I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who is even a little interested in science or people who just want a difficult yet interesting read. It will help you gain a better understanding of the universe we live in and make you all the better for it. "
291,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72589375-m,5,"First off, I loved how the book was concepted to look like an ecyclopedia, with less text and many picturesque details. I wish I was more educated on these things to understand the author better though, but that's my fault. Mr Hawking did a spledid job simplifying some pretty complex things and presenting them in a way that almost anyone can understand. And all that, followed by his witty humor and jokes, made this book an amazing reading experience. I will be returning to my notes to remind myself of the things I'd like to remember- these things that actually make the science of our existence, ours and everything else's, yet we peacefully swim through our everyday lives completely ignorant and uninterested in something that should concern all of us. I wonder where we'd all be if it wasn't for people who dared to wonder and think further than known and look beyond mundane triviality. Our planet lacks optimistic minds, who still perfectly understand what pain and loss is, like this great person did."
292,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25858286-dan-arrows,4,"Loved it.But it also shows why deep physics and astronomy nowadays cannot be fully understood without the mathematical knowledge.Some passages try to explain recent discoveries in the fields of quantum physics and string theory in a basic language and they simply make no sense at all (well, at least to me).I am pretty sure I understood a lot of the book's concepts in terms of what they mean in the human current comprehension of the universe, but some of the other bits (such as a particle spinning 360º and NOT ending up in the starting position) make no sense to me at all, proving that they might only work properly in the mathematical demonstrations.I hope to make some more advanced reading in the mathematics and basic physics to further my astrophysics knowledges in the future. The book is a very pleasant starting point, but no one should stop there. The same is valid for it's ""prequel"", Hawking's ""A brief history of time""."
293,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7280712-becky,4,"Rating 3.75. In this book Stephen Hawking gives a non-technical overview of the theor(ies) of relativity, quantum mechanics, the nature of space-time, parallel universes, the potential for time travel, and the likelihood of encountering intelligent life in the universe. I listened to this book twice in audio format - the first time to grasp the terminology at a high level and the second to actually think through the concepts. While Hawking states that the book was written for those without a background in physics some of the concepts were tricky to understand the first time through. Hawking also has a frustrating habit of back-referencing to concepts introduced briefly in previous chapters without ever providing a sufficiently in depth explanation of the concept. I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
294,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
295,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
296,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
297,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
298,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
299,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."

310,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
311,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
312,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
313,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."

Also, this book illustrates a plain example of how ignorance can put a halt to science. Einstein left Germany just before the Nazi hunt for Jewish scientists began. If there had been no hateful Nazi party, more progress might have been made and a European atomic bomb may have been created earlier on. Progress was lost as a direct consequence of ignorance and unfounded hatred."

I can tell you that he is indeed one of the best minds and that this book is really good. I rated the book 5 stars because it was one of the most interesting and mind bending books I have read in a while. This book, The Universe in a Nutshell, was written by Stephen Hawking for the intent of explaining the universe on much simpler terms. He does an excellent job at explaining almost impossible concepts to grasp like the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He does it in a way that allows the average person to have a brief understanding and knowledge on the subjects. There is a reason why it is a New York Times Bestseller and I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who is even a little interested in science or people who just want a difficult yet interesting read. It will help you gain a better understanding of the universe we live in and make you all the better for it. "
321,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72589375-m,5,"First off, I loved how the book was concepted to look like an ecyclopedia, with less text and many picturesque details. I wish I was more educated on these things to understand the author better though, but that's my fault. Mr Hawking did a spledid job simplifying some pretty complex things and presenting them in a way that almost anyone can understand. And all that, followed by his witty humor and jokes, made this book an amazing reading experience. I will be returning to my notes to remind myself of the things I'd like to remember- these things that actually make the science of our existence, ours and everything else's, yet we peacefully swim through our everyday lives completely ignorant and uninterested in something that should concern all of us. I wonder where we'd all be if it wasn't for people who dared to wonder and think further than known and look beyond mundane triviality. Our planet lacks optimistic minds, who still perfectly understand what pain and loss is, like this great person did."

In this book Stephen Hawking gives a non-technical overview of the theor(ies) of relativity, quantum mechanics, the nature of space-time, parallel universes, the potential for time travel, and the likelihood of encountering intelligent life in the universe. I listened to this book twice in audio format - the first time to grasp the terminology at a high level and the second to actually think through the concepts. While Hawking states that the book was written for those without a background in physics some of the concepts were tricky to understand the first time through. Hawking also has a frustrating habit of back-referencing to concepts introduced briefly in previous chapters without ever providing a sufficiently in depth explanation of the concept. I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
324,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
325,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
326,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
327,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
328,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
329,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."

340,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
341,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
342,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
343,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."
344,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,3,"This is a shorter version of A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawing. It is shorter because the author felt that his earlier work contained too much preliminary material so that many readers did not get to the main topics later in the book. This current book was meant to sidestep that matter and in doing so he lost a star with me.If you are not familiar with the material already, the book is going to seem like it is moving too quickly. You are taking for granted that the author is correct, or at least giving a balanced view of the subject. This is what I normally call a ""little old lady"" book. A little old lady wants to cross the street, so the author kindly takes her hand and leads her across. He is not trying to teach her how to cross the street on her own. He doesn't explain the red and green lights, pushing the pedestrian cross button, so that next time she could cross by herself. He just leads her across. That is both good and bad. Your mileage may vary.Personally I think folks should read A Brief History of Time. It contains most of the same material, better explained.I will probably read this book again to review the knowledge I already have, but not to gain further knowledge."
345,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112924942-adriana-ogawa,3,"In this book, Stephen proposes more independent chapters compared to ""A Brief Story of Time"", claiming that it wouldn't be necessary to depend on a continuous sequence of concepts. However, I missed a lot of the previous storytelling and at some points I felt like reading a heavy academic book. The idea of indexing images to help explain some main concepts is pleasant to me, but some of them are just graphically hard to admire, to be honest. Talking about the bright side, Stephen is a great writer and always makes me wonder about how small our existence in this world is compared to the beginning of the universe and how everything is so fragile and ephemeral. The parts where he explains the expansion of the universe, the possibility of time travel through wormholes, and when he describes some provoking points about the future of human race were the highlights of this book. The reason I gave it 3 stars is not because it presents complex theories that are much harder to keep up than the previous book, but due to using repetition hoping it would help us understand some concepts that are misplaced, telling 1000 things almost grasping for air. The book felt like it had much more than just one author, maybe because they were looking for another bestseller, losing its previous storytelling and with a very weird closure. Still, I look forward to writing a better review on ""Brief Answers to Big Questions"" soon."
346,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"I read A Brief History of Time prior to reading this book, and there is a lot of overlap, hence the slightly lower rating. This book feels like a more summarized version of the concepts discussed in Brief History, plus 30% new content. The new content, such as strings and branes, feels less “science-heavy”, which is probably because these are brand new topics that physicists are still exploring. They are very exciting to read about and has a fiction-like quality. In general, the language and writing style in this book feels much more toned down. The captions and extra info in sidebars are helpful, but not required for understanding the main content.If you want more in-depth and comprehensive discussion of concepts, I recommend A Brief History of Time. It includes many introductory physics concepts and their development over time. However, it is a heavier read and written in a linear fashion. If one got stuck at an earlier chapter, it is harder to progress.If you want a more summarized version of concepts, and a brief introduction to the new theories being researched, The Universe in a Nutshell might be a better choice. This book is not written in a linear fashion, so even if one got super confused by one chapter, it won’t affect understanding of the subsequent chapters. I was personally really confused by chapter five and I am not sure what the entire chapter described, but I was able to understand the following chapters well."
347,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4864790-andrada,4,"Most of the things I knew about astrophysics were from SF books and shows which, while some are well documented and some even written by professionals in the field (I’m looking at you, Alastair Reynolds), they’re still speculative in nature and it’s hard to judge where real physics ends and fantasy begins with them. I therefore found Stephen Hawking’s The Universe in a Nutshell very illuminating, clearly defining some of the concepts I had come across in SF books (singularities, black holes, dark matter), but also introducing me to many I had only heard about in passing (superstring theory, P-branes).I would have liked to read an updated, more recent version of it, as some of the chapters left me wondering what progress has been made in the field in the last nearly twenty years since the book came out. I also felt that at times Stephen Hawking, as a supporter of certain theories, failed to give a complete view of a subject, presenting instead the theories he thought valid. That’s to be expected since he was a practicing physicist I suppose, but it did make me curious about what other theories might be out there. Although a few concepts flew over my head, I did find most of the book to be accessible and the explanations easy to follow. It’s definitely a good place to start diving into the subject!"

I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
354,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
355,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
356,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
357,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
358,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
359,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."

And that is my review in a nutshell. "
361,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25672215-anamarija,3," I feel kinda bad critiqueing Stephen Hawking, but this book felt like a mess. The ideas weren't really properly explained, it was mostly just: ""Oh, me and Penrose, we proved that..."" and he just tells us what they proved but there is no story behind the ideas, nothing feels personal or enthusiastic, whatever. It also makes it harder to read because that's boring. Also I feel like he wanted to explain too much too fast so the book doesn't feel unified. The illustrations are amazing tho."
362,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100040541-mustafa-jawad,4,"This is one of the more complex of Hawking's writings. String theory, time travel, and general relativity are not easy to wrap your head around. But Hawking explains it much better than any other author I've read.This version also includes pictures and diagrams, which aid in understanding, as if Hawking's rhetoric wasn't good enough.I won't recommend this to someone who wants to get into science for the first time, but this is great if you're interested in string theory, M theory and general relativity; especially if you're a fan of Stephen Hawking."

Since the book publication, LIGO and LHC produced a number of gravitational, particle discoveries, actually raising some more questions in the process, for supersymmetry, hierarchy question, extension of standard model, but that doesn't diminish anything of its value. On the contrary. Keep curious."

Despite Hawkings efforts, this book was not particularly digestible or friendly to the average reader. It’s not his fault that the concepts he explained were baffling, but I found this book more esoteric than A Brief History of Time even though he was attempting to accomplish the opposite. The latter half of the book focused on more recent developments in Physics and felt so theoretical and removed from reality that I lost interest. The former half, however, provided an interesting history of relativity and quantum theory. First three chapters were for sure the best."
365,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75897725-joel-sam,4,Hawking effectively summarizes the principles of astrophysics with accompanying images and examples. Some of the discussion on brane theory is quite speculative and difficult to understand for the lay reader.

But it seems to be a bunch of unrelated explanations. There’s nothing to tie it all together. Maybe that’s where astrophysics is right now. Also the book is 17 years old.

375,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"This book doesn't do much to clarify Hawking's earlier work. There are more pictures and diagrams, but the narrative is overly abbreviated or unclear. Other books by other writers do a better job of describing the same material (and even Hawking's own theoretical contributions).There are a few observations in this book that stood out as ways of conveying difficult concepts. Spacetime is best viewed not as passive background, for example, but as an active participant ""in the dynamics of the universe."" He makes it clear that there is vacuum energy in space and that it corresponds to matter (with gravitational effects), per Einstein's formula that equates matter and energy. In his glossary, Hawking gives a good definition of mass (quantity of matter in a body, which is it's inertia or resistance to acceleration). Hawking also writes that matter and energy decouple after the big bang. Off hand, this seems to say that underlying matter and energy in the pre-big bang moment there is just one thing. Or, alternatively, he may be saying that ""raw"" energy is the most basic constituent in the universe and that matter flows out of it (after initial cooling), eventually allowing the formation of inorganic (quarks, atoms, molecules) and then, organic compounds. If the latter, this also implies that there is a significant directionality and identity (i.e., what combines with what, and how) that lies at the cosmic core.At the end of this book, Hawking strays a bit by saying that human intelligence is defined by brain size, which makes one wonder about Neanderthals, whales and elephants, and he predicts that after a couple of decades, the computer will be as complex as the human brain. "
376,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42270195-ishmael,4,"This book is aesthetic perfection. It really stands out from the crowd. Try holding a copy in your own hands - it practically calls out to be read. And that's just the front cover. The illustrations that grace every page are remarkable because they manage to explain, with complete lucidity, exactly what the words in the text can't quite say, and yet also bring a smile to my face in a way that I doubted Relativity ever would during my school years. Stephen Hawking is a great guide in the world of popular science. The subject matter isn't easy. In fact, at first glance, it seems so impenetrable that understanding it would be like escaping from a black hole (once you've passed the event horizon). However, he leads the reader through a series of logical steps, with enough interesting asides and amusing anecdotes that it doesn't become just another textbook. He also isn't afraid to think about the really interesting topics, such as time travel, which I though was admirable. One point I would make - it is described as the sequel to A Brief History of Time. However, I would personally recommend reading this one first. Many of the concepts are the same, and the exquisite illustrations make them more easily understandable. "
377,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2728604-dale-gomez,4,"This book describes the things of which dreams are made, and topics philosophers have been questioning for millenia. Open your imagination if you read this book, because you will need it. As Hawkins quotes his good friend and collegue whose name eludes me at the moment, science is imagination in a strait jacket. I couldn't agree more and noticed this very fact in my experiences in the field of science. The best scientist (or at least most likely to be ground breaking) seem to have a bit of a creative bent coupled with imagination. Although Hawkins spares us the details of the bindings, he allows us to enter into the world of imagination required for grasping the implications of modern day theoretical physics. "
378,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3111883-evan,3,"This book serves as a reminder of just how large the gap is between popular science offerings geared towards the masses, shiny magazine articles and Discovery Channel TV shows full of CGI graphics and a taste of the science behind them, and the actual world of theoretical physics. I consider myself something of a 'space geek', but after reading this book it's clear that I am no physicist. While the theories contained within the book are abstract enough on their own to confuse most people, the attempts at explaining the various equations and experiments needed to prove them are enough to require that certain passages be re-read. I'm glad I finished the book, but I fear I won't be joining Dr. Hawking at Cambridge any time soon."
379,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286571-lee,4,"For the average lay-person, such as myself, this one is a little hard to keep up with at times. I'll admit it; my brain is nutshell-like, and therefore, Hawking's rate of explanation required me to review some concepts several times. But just because you got a bachelor of arts to avoid that math requirement like I did, don't let that stop you from trying to grasp at least 50% of what Hawking is saying here. Absorbing a fraction of genius is better than absorbing none at all all. In fact, I'd wager you'll be grateful there's someone out there light-years ahead of your own intelligence after reading this book."
380,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4774600-alyssa,3,"Eh. This is an okay book. If you are looking for a book that provides good information about the universe I'd say go ahead and read this book! I personally didn't like this book because I couldn't understand it. I only read the first 100 pages. I wasn't going to make myself suffer through another 100 pages. I just really didn't like it. But, It wasn't the worst book in the world. I can say that Stephen Hawking is one of the smartest man on earth. Maybe I would've liked it if he described and explained the material he was covering easier. All in all this book was okay to read, if you understand the concept of everything."

Overall, it was a decent book and I'd recommend it for any science enthusiastic with a non-physics background. Yet, the thing is, books like these slowly get outdated just because of new incoming data. Particle physicists have explored and found many interesting things in LHC. Gravitational wave detections created many opportunities to further our understanding of black holes and other supermassive objects. Hot science topics that are very relevant to the context of this book. Now I'm wondering how this book would change after all these things."

400,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
401,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
402,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
403,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."
404,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,3,"This is a shorter version of A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawing. It is shorter because the author felt that his earlier work contained too much preliminary material so that many readers did not get to the main topics later in the book. This current book was meant to sidestep that matter and in doing so he lost a star with me.If you are not familiar with the material already, the book is going to seem like it is moving too quickly. You are taking for granted that the author is correct, or at least giving a balanced view of the subject. This is what I normally call a ""little old lady"" book. A little old lady wants to cross the street, so the author kindly takes her hand and leads her across. He is not trying to teach her how to cross the street on her own. He doesn't explain the red and green lights, pushing the pedestrian cross button, so that next time she could cross by herself. He just leads her across. That is both good and bad. Your mileage may vary.Personally I think folks should read A Brief History of Time. It contains most of the same material, better explained.I will probably read this book again to review the knowledge I already have, but not to gain further knowledge."

However, I missed a lot of the previous storytelling and at some points I felt like reading a heavy academic book. The idea of indexing images to help explain some main concepts is pleasant to me, but some of them are just graphically hard to admire, to be honest. Talking about the bright side, Stephen is a great writer and always makes me wonder about how small our existence in this world is compared to the beginning of the universe and how everything is so fragile and ephemeral. The parts where he explains the expansion of the universe, the possibility of time travel through wormholes, and when he describes some provoking points about the future of human race were the highlights of this book. The reason I gave it 3 stars is not because it presents complex theories that are much harder to keep up than the previous book, but due to using repetition hoping it would help us understand some concepts that are misplaced, telling 1000 things almost grasping for air. The book felt like it had much more than just one author, maybe because they were looking for another bestseller, losing its previous storytelling and with a very weird closure. Still, I look forward to writing a better review on ""Brief Answers to Big Questions"" soon."

I therefore found Stephen Hawking’s The Universe in a Nutshell very illuminating, clearly defining some of the concepts I had come across in SF books (singularities, black holes, dark matter), but also introducing me to many I had only heard about in passing (superstring theory, P-branes).I would have liked to read an updated, more recent version of it, as some of the chapters left me wondering what progress has been made in the field in the last nearly twenty years since the book came out. I also felt that at times Stephen Hawking, as a supporter of certain theories, failed to give a complete view of a subject, presenting instead the theories he thought valid.

It's pointed out in this book that he had just stumbled upon some natural laws and that he should not be solely blamed for the existence of nuclear weapons. Also, this book illustrates a plain example of how ignorance can put a halt to science. Einstein left Germany just before the Nazi hunt for Jewish scientists began.

It raise me more interest in time, universe even more, this book also help me to enlarge my knowledge, theory of everything, how universe run and universe structures which lead to theory that the space- time we are living is just 3 dimension space but it can be up to 10 dimensions, just like layers after layers but maybe layer is too small to see or feel it. There are so may theories about universe, black hole or time-space which makes me feel overwhelmed and excited at the same time. This book is short, that’s kind of textbook which contains a vast of knowledge about universe and space and time which illustrate universe with images and theories attached.I suddenly want to tell my old friend that I read this book and intend to move to Elon Musk book which is 2 or 3 years ago i would never think I would read that kind of book in the future.

410,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70654169-nathan-meyers,5,"In commemoration of the passing of one of the best minds of our century, Stephen Hawking, I decided that I would read some of his work. I can tell you that he is indeed one of the best minds and that this book is really good. I rated the book 5 stars because it was one of the most interesting and mind bending books I have read in a while. This book, The Universe in a Nutshell, was written by Stephen Hawking for the intent of explaining the universe on much simpler terms. He does an excellent job at explaining almost impossible concepts to grasp like the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He does it in a way that allows the average person to have a brief understanding and knowledge on the subjects. There is a reason why it is a New York Times Bestseller and I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who is even a little interested in science or people who just want a difficult yet interesting read. It will help you gain a better understanding of the universe we live in and make you all the better for it. "
411,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72589375-m,5,"First off, I loved how the book was concepted to look like an ecyclopedia, with less text and many picturesque details. I wish I was more educated on these things to understand the author better though, but that's my fault. Mr Hawking did a spledid job simplifying some pretty complex things and presenting them in a way that almost anyone can understand. And all that, followed by his witty humor and jokes, made this book an amazing reading experience. I will be returning to my notes to remind myself of the things I'd like to remember- these things that actually make the science of our existence, ours and everything else's, yet we peacefully swim through our everyday lives completely ignorant and uninterested in something that should concern all of us. I wonder where we'd all be if it wasn't for people who dared to wonder and think further than known and look beyond mundane triviality. Our planet lacks optimistic minds, who still perfectly understand what pain and loss is, like this great person did."
412,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25858286-dan-arrows,4,"Loved it.But it also shows why deep physics and astronomy nowadays cannot be fully understood without the mathematical knowledge.Some passages try to explain recent discoveries in the fields of quantum physics and string theory in a basic language and they simply make no sense at all (well, at least to me).I am pretty sure I understood a lot of the book's concepts in terms of what they mean in the human current comprehension of the universe, but some of the other bits (such as a particle spinning 360º and NOT ending up in the starting position) make no sense to me at all, proving that they might only work properly in the mathematical demonstrations.I hope to make some more advanced reading in the mathematics and basic physics to further my astrophysics knowledges in the future. The book is a very pleasant starting point, but no one should stop there. The same is valid for it's ""prequel"", Hawking's ""A brief history of time""."
413,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7280712-becky,4,"Rating 3.75. In this book Stephen Hawking gives a non-technical overview of the theor(ies) of relativity, quantum mechanics, the nature of space-time, parallel universes, the potential for time travel, and the likelihood of encountering intelligent life in the universe. I listened to this book twice in audio format - the first time to grasp the terminology at a high level and the second to actually think through the concepts. While Hawking states that the book was written for those without a background in physics some of the concepts were tricky to understand the first time through. Hawking also has a frustrating habit of back-referencing to concepts introduced briefly in previous chapters without ever providing a sufficiently in depth explanation of the concept. I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
414,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
415,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
416,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
417,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
418,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
419,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."

430,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
431,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
432,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
433,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."

Most of reason is my lacking knowledge in physics then most of time i read this book i moved between Partially understand to Totally not understand.I tried to understand this book in most common and reasonable way that I can.Funny is even though it’s hard to read and even in Vietnamese I still dont understand what I am reading I still read and enjoy it. It raise me more interest in time, universe even more, this book also help me to enlarge my knowledge, theory of everything, how universe run and universe structures which lead to theory that the space- time we are living is just 3 dimension space but it can be up to 10 dimensions, just like layers after layers but maybe layer is too small to see or feel it. There are so may theories about universe, black hole or time-space which makes me feel overwhelmed and excited at the same time. This book is short, that’s kind of textbook which contains a vast of knowledge about universe and space and time which illustrate universe with images and theories attached.I suddenly want to tell my old friend that I read this book and intend to move to Elon Musk book which is 2 or 3 years ago i would never think I would read that kind of book in the future. Somehow right now i enjoy reading that kind of book."
440,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70654169-nathan-meyers,5,"In commemoration of the passing of one of the best minds of our century, Stephen Hawking, I decided that I would read some of his work. I can tell you that he is indeed one of the best minds and that this book is really good. I rated the book 5 stars because it was one of the most interesting and mind bending books I have read in a while. This book, The Universe in a Nutshell, was written by Stephen Hawking for the intent of explaining the universe on much simpler terms. He does an excellent job at explaining almost impossible concepts to grasp like the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He does it in a way that allows the average person to have a brief understanding and knowledge on the subjects. There is a reason why it is a New York Times Bestseller and I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who is even a little interested in science or people who just want a difficult yet interesting read. It will help you gain a better understanding of the universe we live in and make you all the better for it. "
441,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72589375-m,5,"First off, I loved how the book was concepted to look like an ecyclopedia, with less text and many picturesque details. I wish I was more educated on these things to understand the author better though, but that's my fault. Mr Hawking did a spledid job simplifying some pretty complex things and presenting them in a way that almost anyone can understand. And all that, followed by his witty humor and jokes, made this book an amazing reading experience. I will be returning to my notes to remind myself of the things I'd like to remember- these things that actually make the science of our existence, ours and everything else's, yet we peacefully swim through our everyday lives completely ignorant and uninterested in something that should concern all of us. I wonder where we'd all be if it wasn't for people who dared to wonder and think further than known and look beyond mundane triviality. Our planet lacks optimistic minds, who still perfectly understand what pain and loss is, like this great person did."
442,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25858286-dan-arrows,4,"Loved it.But it also shows why deep physics and astronomy nowadays cannot be fully understood without the mathematical knowledge.Some passages try to explain recent discoveries in the fields of quantum physics and string theory in a basic language and they simply make no sense at all (well, at least to me).I am pretty sure I understood a lot of the book's concepts in terms of what they mean in the human current comprehension of the universe, but some of the other bits (such as a particle spinning 360º and NOT ending up in the starting position) make no sense to me at all, proving that they might only work properly in the mathematical demonstrations.I hope to make some more advanced reading in the mathematics and basic physics to further my astrophysics knowledges in the future. The book is a very pleasant starting point, but no one should stop there. The same is valid for it's ""prequel"", Hawking's ""A brief history of time""."
443,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7280712-becky,4,"Rating 3.75. In this book Stephen Hawking gives a non-technical overview of the theor(ies) of relativity, quantum mechanics, the nature of space-time, parallel universes, the potential for time travel, and the likelihood of encountering intelligent life in the universe. I listened to this book twice in audio format - the first time to grasp the terminology at a high level and the second to actually think through the concepts. While Hawking states that the book was written for those without a background in physics some of the concepts were tricky to understand the first time through. Hawking also has a frustrating habit of back-referencing to concepts introduced briefly in previous chapters without ever providing a sufficiently in depth explanation of the concept. I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
444,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
445,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
446,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
447,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
448,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
449,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."
450,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50103036-joao-jesus,5,"Amazing book. I consider myself an absolute zero when it comes to the subjects of quantum physics, string theory etc. But I was actually able to grasp some of the concepts explained in this book. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of this planet and having a book explaining some of the most complex mathematical challenges that he worked on is amazing. Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."
451,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4540145-cathy,3,"This was a super interesting, quite quick listen. I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy. Rating is 3.5/5 stars."

Reading this book, I can feel Stephen Hawking's passion in each sentences. By some ways, he passes me his flame passion.

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."
454,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64057160-maciek-wiktorowski,5,"Outstanding!Hawking has the gift of explaining things of extreme complexity in a very simple way. The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."
455,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095250-tonks,3,"Listened to the audiobook. The subject is very interesting and there is a gentle sense of humor. Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."
456,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64668330-michael,3,"Probably 3.5. Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Regardless, I found this a little disappointing. I'm a fan of both Hawking's work and the man himself, but I found this book didn't captivate me or make a significant change to my model of reality. It's well written, detailed, and often quite witty — ""black holes are not hairy"" — but left me unsatisfied and quite confused.A pretty decent overview of the structure and contents can be found at http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-universe-in-a-nutshell/#gsc.tab=0"

Curled-up dimensions, worm holes and time loops. This is so cool. Stephen Hawking is even cooler, and actually sometimes funny. I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop. Provided the aliens have learned how to bend space-time, that is."

Stephen Hawking does an excellent job of conveying the overall concepts and the diagrams and illustrations are very helpful. As my post-grad supervisor told me when I was doing my first departmental presentation, if you can get one concept across so that people understand it then you've done a good job, and I think that is the approach that Hawking takes with ""The Universe in a Nutshell""."

Fast forward and I grabbed this one. It is a lot easier to understand, although there are still parts that make me say 'Huh?' I also caught myself grinning every time I heard the Big Bang Theory as I immediately thought of Sheldon Cooper. Also, I actually learned a few things about string theory and a couple of other terms the guys throw around on the show.

It is quite a bit more complex and, for someone of my level of physics knowledge, quite difficult to understand at certain points. In ABHoT, I never felt this was the case, as even the most unintuitive concepts were explained clearly and made comprehensible. Additionally, the ""narrative"" of The Universe in a Nutshell is jumpy and non-linear, and I found myself feeling whiplashed between various crazy cosmological theories. "

Rating is 3.5/5 stars."

It is easy for people like me - who never pay too much attention about physics, chemistry,.. or any kind of science - to understand, every words seemed quite academic now just come right to my brain, every theorem used to be so strange to me, now I grasp it. Reading this book, I can feel Stephen Hawking's passion in each sentences. By some ways, he passes me his flame passion. Now I am more curious about the world we are living, how it work, anh what it used to be. I just want to send him my love and my respect, I will support you every seconds.

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."

The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."

Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."

Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Regardless, I found this a little disappointing. I'm a fan of both Hawking's work and the man himself, but I found this book didn't captivate me or make a significant change to my model of reality. It's well written, detailed, and often quite witty — ""black holes are not hairy"" — but left me unsatisfied and quite confused.A pretty decent overview of the structure and contents can be found at http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-universe-in-a-nutshell/#gsc.tab=0"

Curled-up dimensions, worm holes and time loops. This is so cool. Stephen Hawking is even cooler, and actually sometimes funny. I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop.

In ABHoT, I never felt this was the case, as even the most unintuitive concepts were explained clearly and made comprehensible.

520,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6731291-mary-soon-lee,4,"Stephen Hawking, who died in 2018, was a preeminent physicist, and this is one of several books that he wrote describing physics for a non-mathematical audience. In it he discusses such things as whether time had a beginning, the nature of black holes, and progress toward a complete unified theory to explain the universe. I found the book fascinating, primarily for the science but also for incidental remarks about the scientists.To my surprise, it was a fairly quick read, the prose free of abtruse contortions, and the text interspersed with diagrams and illustrations. That said, there were times when I was deeply perplexed. I read chapter two twice to understand it better, and there were five places in the subsequent chapters where I wrote question marks to indicate my confusion. Chapter six, where Hawking turns from physics to biology and computers, appealed to me less than the rest of the book. (I found myself questioning his assertions there in a way that I didn't in the physics sections.)I mentioned that I found this a quicker read than I'd expected. The downside to that is that I'd have appreciated more detail, but that may be hard to achieve without getting into nitty-gritty mathematics. Overall, this strikes me as a very good introduction to the areas of theoretical physics that Hawking studied. Interested readers, myself included, can then scurry away to find further books on the subject. Highly recommended.About my book reviews: I try to review every book I read, including those that I don't end up enjoying. The reviews are not scholarly, but just indicate my reaction as a reader, reading being my addiction. I am miserly with 5-star reviews; 4 stars means I liked a book very much; 3 stars means I liked it; 2 stars means I didn't like it (though often the 2-star books are very popular with other readers and/or are by authors whose other work I've loved)."
521,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43007763-swaroop-chougule,5,"Stephen Hawking, A great theoretical physicist, cosmologist whose previous book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a phenomenal success. Since its first publication, there have been numerous scientific developments and technological advancements which has led us to observe micro and macro cosmic world in much more detail than ever. ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" delivers a full understanding of universe ranging from quantum mechanics to time travel to black holes. More than just information, this book compels the reader to think. For example (the best part I liked, because Aliens): Stephen asks how does one account for our lack of extraterrestrial visitors? He reasons, It could be that there is an advanced race out there which is aware of our existence but is leaving us to stew in our own primitive juices. However, it is doubtful it would be so considerate to a lower life-form: do most of us worry how many insects and earthworms we squash underfoot? A more reasonable explanation is that there is a very low probability either of life developing on other planets or of that life developing intelligence. Because we claim to be intelligent, though perhaps without much ground, we tend to see intelligence as an inevitable consequence of evolution. However, one can question that. It is not clear that intelligence has much survival value. Bacteria do very well without intelligence and will survive us if our so-called intelligence causes us to wipe ourselves out in a nuclear war (which doesn't seem so far fetched right now, given global tensions). So he says, as we explore the galaxy we may find primitive life, but we are not likely to find beings like us."
522,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87560620-kyler-alvey,5,"This book can be summed up in three words - My brain hurts.The beginning of this book feels very similar to A Brief History of Time (as a sort of primer for what is to come), but goes into even more detail and covers a number of new topics that the first book either didn't address or hadn't been theorized at the time.It is also much more difficult to wrap your head around. Not really to a scientific or mathematical degree (no need to have a PhD to understand most concepts in the book!), Hawking does a great job putting things in perspective for the layman, but the theories involved are just brain-warpingly difficult to truly grasp. I'm gonna be honest, I only really understood the first half. I was more or less completely lost by the second half (namely cosmic strings, p-branes, the Chronology Protection Conjecture, and the mathematical model of explaining our universe using multi-dimensional branes). It gets intense and likely requires multiple readings to understand properly.Anyway, for crazy nerds like me, I think this book is amazing. It is the best book (including A Brief History of Time) that I've ever read that puts the current (using it lightly, as it is 17 years ""outdated"" for lack of a better word) understanding of our universe and the fundamental laws that govern it in perspective for a regular, although enthusiastic, individual. Hawking does a brilliant job explaining high-level concepts and tries his best to remain unbiased as he understands there is no way we can TRULY know something for a fact, but we can have thorough confidence for/against it.Anyway, great book. I highly recommend it if you're a science/space/physics nerd like me."
523,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35565345-quinn,4,"SummaryHawking works to present fundamental theories of the universe in a way that's digestible to the layman. Pros:- I think Hawking more-or-less succeeded in his efforts to demystify ""life, the universe, and everything,"" as currently understood by our modern scientific models. - I enjoyed Hawking's wry humor; if I recall correctly, he throws in more jokes than The Grand Design.- The reader's performance (and his accent) matched well with the material presented.Cons:- Audiobook format means that figures are lost (though they are only explicitly referenced a few times). - Despite Hawking's best efforts, the material is still incredibly dense. Beyond that, science simply doesn't have all the answers. This second point isn't a con, of course, but worth noting.- I sometimes found myself drifting to sleep while listening to this audiobook. I don't think it was the material present (because I found it interesting), or the presenter's voice (which is appropriately British and spirited), however.ConclusionI enjoyed the work. Also, given that it was published almost two decades ago, I'm curious to know how science has advanced, and how Hawking's thinking has changed over time. I'll have to seek out Brief Answers to the Big Questions, I suppose."
524,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,3,"This is a shorter version of A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawing. It is shorter because the author felt that his earlier work contained too much preliminary material so that many readers did not get to the main topics later in the book. This current book was meant to sidestep that matter and in doing so he lost a star with me.If you are not familiar with the material already, the book is going to seem like it is moving too quickly. You are taking for granted that the author is correct, or at least giving a balanced view of the subject. This is what I normally call a ""little old lady"" book. A little old lady wants to cross the street, so the author kindly takes her hand and leads her across. He is not trying to teach her how to cross the street on her own. He doesn't explain the red and green lights, pushing the pedestrian cross button, so that next time she could cross by herself. He just leads her across. That is both good and bad. Your mileage may vary.Personally I think folks should read A Brief History of Time. It contains most of the same material, better explained.I will probably read this book again to review the knowledge I already have, but not to gain further knowledge."
525,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112924942-adriana-ogawa,3,"In this book, Stephen proposes more independent chapters compared to ""A Brief Story of Time"", claiming that it wouldn't be necessary to depend on a continuous sequence of concepts. However, I missed a lot of the previous storytelling and at some points I felt like reading a heavy academic book. The idea of indexing images to help explain some main concepts is pleasant to me, but some of them are just graphically hard to admire, to be honest. Talking about the bright side, Stephen is a great writer and always makes me wonder about how small our existence in this world is compared to the beginning of the universe and how everything is so fragile and ephemeral. The parts where he explains the expansion of the universe, the possibility of time travel through wormholes, and when he describes some provoking points about the future of human race were the highlights of this book. The reason I gave it 3 stars is not because it presents complex theories that are much harder to keep up than the previous book, but due to using repetition hoping it would help us understand some concepts that are misplaced, telling 1000 things almost grasping for air. The book felt like it had much more than just one author, maybe because they were looking for another bestseller, losing its previous storytelling and with a very weird closure. Still, I look forward to writing a better review on ""Brief Answers to Big Questions"" soon."
526,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"I read A Brief History of Time prior to reading this book, and there is a lot of overlap, hence the slightly lower rating. This book feels like a more summarized version of the concepts discussed in Brief History, plus 30% new content. The new content, such as strings and branes, feels less “science-heavy”, which is probably because these are brand new topics that physicists are still exploring. They are very exciting to read about and has a fiction-like quality. In general, the language and writing style in this book feels much more toned down. The captions and extra info in sidebars are helpful, but not required for understanding the main content.If you want more in-depth and comprehensive discussion of concepts, I recommend A Brief History of Time. It includes many introductory physics concepts and their development over time. However, it is a heavier read and written in a linear fashion. If one got stuck at an earlier chapter, it is harder to progress.If you want a more summarized version of concepts, and a brief introduction to the new theories being researched, The Universe in a Nutshell might be a better choice. This book is not written in a linear fashion, so even if one got super confused by one chapter, it won’t affect understanding of the subsequent chapters. I was personally really confused by chapter five and I am not sure what the entire chapter described, but I was able to understand the following chapters well."
527,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4864790-andrada,4,"Most of the things I knew about astrophysics were from SF books and shows which, while some are well documented and some even written by professionals in the field (I’m looking at you, Alastair Reynolds), they’re still speculative in nature and it’s hard to judge where real physics ends and fantasy begins with them. I therefore found Stephen Hawking’s The Universe in a Nutshell very illuminating, clearly defining some of the concepts I had come across in SF books (singularities, black holes, dark matter), but also introducing me to many I had only heard about in passing (superstring theory, P-branes).I would have liked to read an updated, more recent version of it, as some of the chapters left me wondering what progress has been made in the field in the last nearly twenty years since the book came out. I also felt that at times Stephen Hawking, as a supporter of certain theories, failed to give a complete view of a subject, presenting instead the theories he thought valid. That’s to be expected since he was a practicing physicist I suppose, but it did make me curious about what other theories might be out there. Although a few concepts flew over my head, I did find most of the book to be accessible and the explanations easy to follow. It’s definitely a good place to start diving into the subject!"
528,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11598840-amanda,4,"This was probably the heaviest book I’ve ever read. It covered everything from how Einstein’s theory of relativity served as the building block for basically everything we know about the universe, the plausibility of more fantastic topics such as time travel and being able to tell the future, how it was discovered that there is, in fact, a finite beginning to existence, and the exploration of black holes and wormholes.There was so much information and so many new concepts in this book that I could probably re-read it at least ten more times and glean about as much new information as I did this time around with each read-through.Einstein is blamed for creating nuclear weapons. It's pointed out in this book that he had just stumbled upon some natural laws and that he should not be solely blamed for the existence of nuclear weapons. Also, this book illustrates a plain example of how ignorance can put a halt to science. Einstein left Germany just before the Nazi hunt for Jewish scientists began. If there had been no hateful Nazi party, more progress might have been made and a European atomic bomb may have been created earlier on. Progress was lost as a direct consequence of ignorance and unfounded hatred."

Most of reason is my lacking knowledge in physics then most of time i read this book i moved between Partially understand to Totally not understand.I tried to understand this book in most common and reasonable way that I can.Funny is even though it’s hard to read and even in Vietnamese I still dont understand what I am reading I still read and enjoy it. It raise me more interest in time, universe even more, this book also help me to enlarge my knowledge, theory of everything, how universe run and universe structures which lead to theory that the space- time we are living is just 3 dimension space but it can be up to 10 dimensions, just like layers after layers but maybe layer is too small to see or feel it. There are so may theories about universe, black hole or time-space which makes me feel overwhelmed and excited at the same time. This book is short, that’s kind of textbook which contains a vast of knowledge about universe and space and time which illustrate universe with images and theories attached.I suddenly want to tell my old friend that I read this book and intend to move to Elon Musk book which is 2 or 3 years ago i would never think I would read that kind of book in the future. Somehow right now i enjoy reading that kind of book."
530,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70654169-nathan-meyers,5,"In commemoration of the passing of one of the best minds of our century, Stephen Hawking, I decided that I would read some of his work. I can tell you that he is indeed one of the best minds and that this book is really good. I rated the book 5 stars because it was one of the most interesting and mind bending books I have read in a while. This book, The Universe in a Nutshell, was written by Stephen Hawking for the intent of explaining the universe on much simpler terms. He does an excellent job at explaining almost impossible concepts to grasp like the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He does it in a way that allows the average person to have a brief understanding and knowledge on the subjects. There is a reason why it is a New York Times Bestseller and I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who is even a little interested in science or people who just want a difficult yet interesting read. It will help you gain a better understanding of the universe we live in and make you all the better for it. "
531,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72589375-m,5,"First off, I loved how the book was concepted to look like an ecyclopedia, with less text and many picturesque details. I wish I was more educated on these things to understand the author better though, but that's my fault. Mr Hawking did a spledid job simplifying some pretty complex things and presenting them in a way that almost anyone can understand. And all that, followed by his witty humor and jokes, made this book an amazing reading experience. I will be returning to my notes to remind myself of the things I'd like to remember- these things that actually make the science of our existence, ours and everything else's, yet we peacefully swim through our everyday lives completely ignorant and uninterested in something that should concern all of us. I wonder where we'd all be if it wasn't for people who dared to wonder and think further than known and look beyond mundane triviality. Our planet lacks optimistic minds, who still perfectly understand what pain and loss is, like this great person did."
532,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25858286-dan-arrows,4,"Loved it.But it also shows why deep physics and astronomy nowadays cannot be fully understood without the mathematical knowledge.Some passages try to explain recent discoveries in the fields of quantum physics and string theory in a basic language and they simply make no sense at all (well, at least to me).I am pretty sure I understood a lot of the book's concepts in terms of what they mean in the human current comprehension of the universe, but some of the other bits (such as a particle spinning 360º and NOT ending up in the starting position) make no sense to me at all, proving that they might only work properly in the mathematical demonstrations.I hope to make some more advanced reading in the mathematics and basic physics to further my astrophysics knowledges in the future. The book is a very pleasant starting point, but no one should stop there. The same is valid for it's ""prequel"", Hawking's ""A brief history of time""."
533,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7280712-becky,4,"Rating 3.75. In this book Stephen Hawking gives a non-technical overview of the theor(ies) of relativity, quantum mechanics, the nature of space-time, parallel universes, the potential for time travel, and the likelihood of encountering intelligent life in the universe. I listened to this book twice in audio format - the first time to grasp the terminology at a high level and the second to actually think through the concepts. While Hawking states that the book was written for those without a background in physics some of the concepts were tricky to understand the first time through. Hawking also has a frustrating habit of back-referencing to concepts introduced briefly in previous chapters without ever providing a sufficiently in depth explanation of the concept. I would recommend the text form of the book instead of the audio format since the text contains figures and graphs which aren't described in the audio format. "
534,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 2001, inspired by Hamlet, Hawking is compiling what we know about the universe's shape, its properties (beginning, age, mass, expansion and so on) and its singularities (black holes). The text and figures are palatable to any curious person and his arguments are supported by relativity, quantum mechanics and his own theories on black holes. The whole thing is beautifully illustrated. The stunning illustrations complement the text in a fine tuned symbiosis almost like atoms holding each other in an interesting molecule. As a result, this book plays with your perception of time flow while reading it. When your stamina is running low (say you are about to run for coffee) here comes another illustration to keep you awake. And then you get back to digesting the text. But suddenly Hawking throws a joke, bet with his friend or honest assessment on humans (e.g. ""Humans don't have a very good record of intelligent behavior""). This is very entertaining and informative."
535,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90308008-leila,4,"This book I listened to as an audiobook after I became interested in the scientific view point, one which I have not had much exposure to, seeing as I was raised in a religious family. I loved it. It introduced a whole new world to me, with so many mysterious forces that has left humans scrambling to explain. It was well explained and organized. It didn't jump all over the place and should have been easy to understand. But I didn't understand half of what was in there, I was pretty much lost the whole time. But, I hope to understand some day, and that's really all anyone can do. I will give this 4 stars but more for a personal reason, this book has captured my interest and I now have a whole new genre of books to explore. It isn't very long but does take a while (or forever) to fully understand pretty much the whole timeline of scientific discoveries known to us. However, it's worth it and I have enjoyed this immensely."
536,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68868182-jeff-spencer,2,"Not sure where I stand on this book, just that it was interesting to see what Hawking's beliefs were. I never really knew he was so opposed to Einstein's theories, nor did I know that he believed some of the things that would be classified as sci-fi. For what it sought to accomplish, I guess I could say it was a good book. However, I am more inclined to not accept some of the things he has stated after reading this book. He paints a very strange picture of the world we live in, and although a lot of the stuff cannot be proven, I find it very interesting. Things like time travel and aliens, and even parallel universes. To say I agree with his work would be a lie, but to say it is not interesting is also a lie. So I am forced to look at it as just one man's very strange opinion of the world we live in, and cannot really say I agree with most of it, and for that, I have to give this book 2 stars."
537,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,4,"His crash course on space. Reads like a textbook on theoretical physics and cosmology, but with some personality and humor. There’s illustrations or pictures on almost every page, which was much needed and appreciated to visualize whatever is being explained. The only drawback is the lack of accessibility to anyone outside of a math/science background. Constants, integers, and pulsars are referenced casually. A violin is used to explain string theory in three paragraphs. There’s still plenty to gain from a general understanding of what’s being discussed. Hawking’s humor comes unexpectedly, like making a wheelchair joke while explaining quantum theory. His chapter on the future of humanity was great and discussed our exponential growth problem, modifying DNA, and the electric and chemical limitations of both our brains and computers. Then he sends the reader on a real trip in the last chapter with M-theory and branes. "
538,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22721483-patrick-tucker,4,"I found this more accessible than A Briefer History of Time, however, it is starting to feel a bit dated in some of the lingo and speculation of the future. I would call it a good starting text on understanding astrophysics. Some technical jargon, some silliness, but great general information delivered in a way that most people could at least grasp. I know I started to get lost in some of the details in the end chapters but it still maintained my interest.The most positive aspect is the lack of the author's preferences in the book. It is presented as fact with the science backing it explained as plainly as possible. I contrast it to some of the Neil deGrasse Tyson I have read where you can feel the superiority complex oozing through the text.Dated but still a nice read since most of the principles have not changed."
539,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"I read this as part of the combined Illustrated Brief History/Universe in a Nutshell. For the first volume, I thought that Hawking strikes a good balance between superficiality and complexity. He manages to cover topics as advanced as black hole radiation, naked singularities, imaginary time, CPT symmetry, etc., without intimidating the reader too much. This time, however, Hawking outdid himself. His discussions about cosmic strings and shadow branes are so glib and shallow, that they seemed almost silly - like they were intended more to blow the reader's mind than to leave him with any meaningful understanding. It was a short and fun read, so it didn't bother me that much, and it did leave me with the desire to read about these topics from an author who's not afraid to challenge his reader somewhat with the actual mathematics."
540,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50103036-joao-jesus,5,"Amazing book. I consider myself an absolute zero when it comes to the subjects of quantum physics, string theory etc. But I was actually able to grasp some of the concepts explained in this book. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of this planet and having a book explaining some of the most complex mathematical challenges that he worked on is amazing. Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."
541,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4540145-cathy,3,"This was a super interesting, quite quick listen. I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy. Rating is 3.5/5 stars."

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."
544,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64057160-maciek-wiktorowski,5,"Outstanding!Hawking has the gift of explaining things of extreme complexity in a very simple way. The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."
545,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095250-tonks,3,"Listened to the audiobook. The subject is very interesting and there is a gentle sense of humor. Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."
546,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64668330-michael,3,"Probably 3.5. Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Regardless, I found this a little disappointing. I'm a fan of both Hawking's work and the man himself, but I found this book didn't captivate me or make a significant change to my model of reality. It's well written, detailed, and often quite witty — ""black holes are not hairy"" — but left me unsatisfied and quite confused.A pretty decent overview of the structure and contents can be found at http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-universe-in-a-nutshell/#gsc.tab=0"

Curled-up dimensions, worm holes and time loops. This is so cool. Stephen Hawking is even cooler, and actually sometimes funny. I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop. Provided the aliens have learned how to bend space-time, that is."

Stephen Hawking does an excellent job of conveying the overall concepts and the diagrams and illustrations are very helpful. As my post-grad supervisor told me when I was doing my first departmental presentation, if you can get one concept across so that people understand it then you've done a good job, and I think that is the approach that Hawking takes with ""The Universe in a Nutshell""."

Fast forward and I grabbed this one. It is a lot easier to understand, although there are still parts that make me say 'Huh?' I also caught myself grinning every time I heard the Big Bang Theory as I immediately thought of Sheldon Cooper. Also, I actually learned a few things about string theory and a couple of other terms the guys throw around on the show.

In ABHoT, I never felt this was the case, as even the most unintuitive concepts were explained clearly and made comprehensible.

Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."

I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy. Rating is 3.5/5 stars."

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."

The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."

Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."

It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed.

It's a predictably heavy topic and i'm sure more went over my head than went in but the parts I could grasp I found incredibly fascinating; particularly wormholes and time travel in chapter five, and genetic modification in chapter six.

Even readers that have some understanding in physics will find themselves lost few times. The famous humor of Hawking dependently makes this book more fun to read."

Still this was delightful little book. It is more technical than an of the previous books that I have read and Hawking does attempt to simplify some of the ideas but they are still difficult to comprehend. The line 'intelligence may not be nesaccarv for survival, in fact it may get in the way' came from this book. "

After I finished ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions"", I was so impressed and wowed by Stephen Hawking's thinking comprehension and vision so I started this book. In my opinion, ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions"" has everything this book can offer and even in a more simplified delivery for someone with very basic understanding of cosmology and theoretical physics but still curious about the universe."

It's a predictably heavy topic and i'm sure more went over my head than went in but the parts I could grasp I found incredibly fascinating; particularly wormholes and time travel in chapter five, and genetic modification in chapter six. What is also a pleasant surprise is how funny Hawkins can be and how he sprinkles popular cultural references throughout to help the reader relate to his theories. "

Much of this book was more than my P-brain could comprehend, but I appreciate his trying to simplify it for non-scientific readers. He and Carl Sagan were amazing in how they stimulate interest in science among young people. I particularly enjoyed his discussion of what the future of human DNA and AI may be as we incorporate computers within our bodies. "

I guess it's meant to convey big-picture information to Plebs like me without getting bogged down in proofs that I wouldn't understand anyway; I enjoyed it, so I guess it worked.

Instead, he discusses imaginary histories and such with no convincing argument as to how anything is known. At best, he says, at least on some topics, we don’t know for sure, but part of this theory is backed up by part of another theory we believe to be true. "

The concepts are explained as simply as possible, I suppose, but I still don't understand them.

655,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908797-amanda,4,Prof Hawking is a brilliant scientist but “A brief history of time” is better. The chapters aren’t logically built upon each other and the theories aren’t well-explained from first principles and are instead stated as facts. What results is that the reader gets lost between statements and observations as there are missing links that are not explained.

I consider myself an absolute zero when it comes to the subjects of quantum physics, string theory etc. But I was actually able to grasp some of the concepts explained in this book. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of this planet and having a book explaining some of the most complex mathematical challenges that he worked on is amazing. Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."
661,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4540145-cathy,3,"This was a super interesting, quite quick listen. I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy.

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."

The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."

Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."

Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Regardless, I found this a little disappointing. I'm a fan of both Hawking's work and the man himself, but I found this book didn't captivate me or make a significant change to my model of reality. It's well written, detailed, and often quite witty — ""black holes are not hairy"" — but left me unsatisfied and quite confused.A pretty decent overview of the structure and contents can be found at http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-universe-in-a-nutshell/#gsc.tab=0"

I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop.

I consider myself an absolute zero when it comes to the subjects of quantum physics, string theory etc. But I was actually able to grasp some of the concepts explained in this book. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of this planet and having a book explaining some of the most complex mathematical challenges that he worked on is amazing. Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."

I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy.

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."

The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."

Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."

Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Curled-up dimensions, worm holes and time loops. This is so cool. Stephen Hawking is even cooler, and actually sometimes funny. I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop. Provided the aliens have learned how to bend space-time, that is."

Stephen Hawking does an excellent job of conveying the overall concepts and the diagrams and illustrations are very helpful. As my post-grad supervisor told me when I was doing my first departmental presentation, if you can get one concept across so that people understand it then you've done a good job, and I think that is the approach that Hawking takes with ""The Universe in a Nutshell""."

I also caught myself grinning every time I heard the Big Bang Theory as I immediately thought of Sheldon Cooper.

I consider myself an absolute zero when it comes to the subjects of quantum physics, string theory etc. But I was actually able to grasp some of the concepts explained in this book. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of this planet and having a book explaining some of the most complex mathematical challenges that he worked on is amazing. Specially when it is so easy to follow and being able to roughly understand a lot of the concepts explained here.Of course I will need to read the book a few more times to try to make sense of some areas that are a bit harder to understand, but overall I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about how the universe works, including quantum mechanics, M theory and even time tavel. Probably not great if you are already knowledgeable about these, but I would still give it a go.5 stars from me for sure."

I think based on knowing there are pictures that I would have gotten more from the book from reading a physical copy. I was doing so well following the book until he started talking about cosmic strings and them being in conical shapes, that got me pretty lost. So time travel is a bit beyond my comprehension I guess. I was understanding relativity a bit better than high school. But yeah overall this was just an informative book. Made me think about how future generations are going to be screwed for real estate space if we don't get some type of space travel going. How fun.Overall would recommend as a once off read. Would recommend the actual book over the audio book. Also would recommend if you like hearing a physicist be sassy... I love that about Stephen Hawking. He was smart and sassy.

Perhaps this is because I have read many other popular science books since then and indeed also studied physics; I am now much more familiar with notions such as space-time, quantum physics. and glowing black holes.Stephen Hawking did a tremendous job with his original book, it truly revolutionised the popular science genre, but perhaps due to its over focus on black holes to the detriment of other topics, this particular title is not a book that would be recommended to first readers of the genre.Perhaps stick to the original."
784,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64057160-maciek-wiktorowski,5,"Outstanding!Hawking has the gift of explaining things of extreme complexity in a very simple way. The book is a pleasant intelectual trip into the laws of universe. For me as humanist, the book was eye-opening and, sometimes, mind-blowing experience. I finally managed to get some understanding of black holes, theory of relativity, m-theory, string theory, and few other things about physics and the universe.Besides having fun I learned answers to few important questions:- is it possible to time travel?- how long does it take until the universe will collapse?- how long time do human beings have until the Earth is not enough?PS Everything is random.Highly recommended."
785,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095250-tonks,3,"Listened to the audiobook. The subject is very interesting and there is a gentle sense of humor. Still, some parts were hard to follow (even though I did two years toward a physics degree), maybe due to missing the illustrations or maybe just the depth/unfamiliarity of the subject matter. I think sometimes a handwaving explanation is more confusing than a detailed one, so even though I understand why the author wouldn't assume the reader understands calculus, etc., I don't know if glossing over such difficult/outlandish material really makes it any easier to grasp. I'll probably listen to this again sometime, or better yet, read the book."

Was really interesting stuff but I feel as though audiobook is not the best way to absorb the content if you don't already have extensive knowledge of physics. It's a lot to wrap your head around and fully take in, something I feel I would've been able to do much better it I'd read it at my own pace, and looked things up as I was reading, rather than the narrator's pace. There was also a lot of repetition, which I didn't mind too much, but I imagine that if I were a physicist I'd be a bit annoyed. So I feel it would've been better if it was either written for experts or dumbed down a lot more for novices, rather than trying to please both. "

Regardless, I found this a little disappointing. I'm a fan of both Hawking's work and the man himself, but I found this book didn't captivate me or make a significant change to my model of reality. It's well written, detailed, and often quite witty — ""black holes are not hairy"" — but left me unsatisfied and quite confused.A pretty decent overview of the structure and contents can be found at http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-the-universe-in-a-nutshell/#gsc.tab=0"

Curled-up dimensions, worm holes and time loops. This is so cool. Stephen Hawking is even cooler, and actually sometimes funny. I really liked this book, but it was not an easy read for me, despite having studied some physics at university. The subject is truely mind-boggling. Lesson learned: Never catch a ride with an alien spaceship from an advanced civilisation, since you can get stuck in an eternal time loop.

I also caught myself grinning every time I heard the Big Bang Theory as I immediately thought of Sheldon Cooper.

In ABHoT, I never felt this was the case, as even the most unintuitive concepts were explained clearly and made comprehensible.

(The first explanation for a blackhole).Light will change its direction by a small angle when it passes near a star because of the curvature of space-time produced by the mass of the starQuasars!"
798,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68695315-tal-delbari,3,"I guess that reading every book that was written by Stephen Hawking can't be a waste of time (especially as he himself works on defining better the definition of time).The book is very short and covers only few topics, relatively fast, but I guess it could be written a bit simpler. Even readers that have some understanding in physics will find themselves lost few times. The famous humor of Hawking dependently makes this book more fun to read."

Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don’t throw it away.""Beautiful images paired with amazing facts and information about our universe. A little harder to understand that Michio Kaku's works, but not quite Master's Degree level writing."

I guess I was expecting something more approachable to the every-man. There were a few things that I could follow and it was cool to see just over the horizon of my understanding for a few minutes, but at the end of the day I'm just glad that this book was mercifully short so that I didn't have to abandon reading it. I don't think I'll read any more of his books though."
801,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,4,"This is the 5th book on astrophysics that I have read this year and I may be more confused about time, space, m theory, and the origins of the universe than when I started. Still this was delightful little book. It is more technical than an of the previous books that I have read and Hawking does attempt to simplify some of the ideas but they are still difficult to comprehend. The line 'intelligence may not be nesaccarv for survival, in fact it may get in the way' came from this book. "
802,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77734330-obada-alzghool,3,"If you're into cosmology and theoretical physics then this book is for you. After I finished ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions"", I was so impressed and wowed by Stephen Hawking's thinking comprehension and vision so I started this book. In my opinion, ""Brief Answers to the Big Questions"" has everything this book can offer and even in a more simplified delivery for someone with very basic understanding of cosmology and theoretical physics but still curious about the universe."
803,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90968521-melissa-malone,3,"Like others, I opted for the popular audiobook. It's a predictably heavy topic and i'm sure more went over my head than went in but the parts I could grasp I found incredibly fascinating; particularly wormholes and time travel in chapter five, and genetic modification in chapter six. What is also a pleasant surprise is how funny Hawkins can be and how he sprinkles popular cultural references throughout to help the reader relate to his theories. "
804,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19801494-kaia,4,"Mr. Hawking has a great sense of humor that comes through in his writings. Much of this book was more than my P-brain could comprehend, but I appreciate his trying to simplify it for non-scientific readers. He and Carl Sagan were amazing in how they stimulate interest in science among young people. I particularly enjoyed his discussion of what the future of human DNA and AI may be as we incorporate computers within our bodies. "
805,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185784-jill-marcotte,4,"I wasn't quite as mind-blown by this one as by A Brief History of Time. I found many of the graphics distracting rather than clarifying. A lot of the same ground was covered in this as in the previous book, which many theories taken a little further, and a few extra ideas thrown in. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, just not quite as much as A Brief History of Time; definitely read that one first."
806,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3269341-james-hurley,4,"Not as easy to understand as his earlier works, but still, informative and insightful information from perhaps the sharpest mind on the planet. I would love to have an evolution discussion with Dr. Hawking, as a more biologically trained science teacher...his perspective from the physics side fascinates me!Thank you Dr. Hawking for all you do."
807,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164427-randy,4,"Cool concepts, but it glosses over a lot of details. I guess it's meant to convey big-picture information to Plebs like me without getting bogged down in proofs that I wouldn't understand anyway; I enjoyed it, so I guess it worked. This book is pretty old, though, so I can't help wondering if a lot of the science is more well understood and fleshed out today."
808,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64439835-k-meredith,4,"Considering how crazy high level these concepts are, I felt like I understood more than I expected to. I feel like I probably should have read this one in print because I would have comprehended more.....but I don't care enough to actually do so. Also, Stephen Hawking is kind of an ass, which sandwiched in science concepts and this very proper british voice is pretty funny."
809,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26076209-kyrie-ele,3,"I mean... I could follow some ideas?!? This isn't a reflection on Hawking however, I like his writing style but I chose to 'read' this book to challenge myself and read outside my comfort zone so mission accomplished? I dunno, maybe next time I want to revisit will buy a physical copy and have a bunch of index cards and highlighters at my disposal."
810,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16356842-sassan,5,"A very good concise read - hence ""The Universe in a Nutshell"". Truly, a good book to refresh my knowledge and understanding of relativity and the modern theories of physics. Did I mention it was full of wit and analogies that helped ease the understanding of these complex theorems? Highly recommended. "
811,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19838373-bruce-madsen,3,"I agree with Marty’s comments. As much as I try, I still find many of the concepts difficult to grasp (and I have a background and affinity for science and engineering). But, I admire Hawking’s effort to show the wonders of the cosmos to the common man. I’m grateful the we had a brilliant mind like his and his tenacity in the face of his disabilities is inspirational. "
812,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35209372-suzanned99,1,"I didn’t like this book. I was hoping for an explanation of things in the universe and how he knows those things to be true. Instead, he discusses imaginary histories and such with no convincing argument as to how anything is known. At best, he says, at least on some topics, we don’t know for sure, but part of this theory is backed up by part of another theory we believe to be true. "
813,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159052-slickmez,5,"Read as an audiobook (in car).A bit heavy going at times and a bit old but well worth the effort (and repeat reads).A follow-up/update to his very popular ""A brief history of time"".The smatterings of humour her and there are entertaining.A brilliant mind - it is a real shame he is no longer with us."
814,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7630475-katia-m-davis,3,"This was ok, I found the first part of it a little repetative if you've read A Brief History of time. I preferred the later chapters that discussed DNA, intelligence, M-Theory, and life elsewhere in the universe. Still, Hawking does have a way of making very complex issues sound relatively simple. An interesting read for a few hours."
815,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266988-tony,4,"Read it twice separated by five years. Still a great read. Main meassage is that there is still alot to uncover at the very small and very large level of “existence” If you read closely you can see how mathematics has put a blinder over modern scientists. Come, seeling math,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful mankind."
816,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10545698-michelle-grant,5,"Ok, this is a 4.7 but I can't give it a 4.00 star. Hawking is a fabulous explanatory writer. If you are interested in physics, as the title states, this book is for you. Basically the physics of the Universe is simply summarized. I especially enjoyed the analogies of particle theory. Amazing science here. "
817,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83081633-iman-maity,3,"I started reading the book, got bored in 30 pages, then took over this audiobook.I think audiobook is better if you are familiar with most of the astronomy, cosmological concepts or you have already read 'a beef history of time'.A always liked the way Hawking explains complicated things, here also he did it effortlessly."
818,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88716412-damian,4,"Hawking blew my mind, but I don't know why! The concepts are explained as simply as possible, I suppose, but I still don't understand them. That's because they are incredibly difficult concepts that can only be appreciated by studying them thoroughly.Nevertheless, still a great and fun read, and a good way to show off."
819,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24778894-chris-kenyon,2,"I was excited to learn more about the universe around me in what was supposed to be book written for the common intelligence, but I found that Stephen Hawkins’ idea of common language is still too advanced for me to fully understand. I did learn from this book, but still felt that I was only able to comprehend about 30% of it."
820,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85596366-ben,3,"Somehow a harder and more complex read than “A Brief History of Time.” The illustrations of all the concepts and theories was astonishing even for clumpy, early 21st century animation. Some very cool stuff but a lot more difficult to read than his other works for an novice interested in astrophysics."
821,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77047665-sugam-misra,4,A great book from a genius. Loved the way he walks the reader through the different concepts of our universe. Even-though it was an easy read for me as I am an Physics grad however I still enjoyed it. 
822,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5890695-bill-glover,4,What makes Hawking a nerd saint to me is the way he gives you five pages of theoretical physics on the possible properties of singularity as a sort of set up to a one sentence sex joke. Expand your imagination and have a chuckle.
823,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24429422-abhilash-ramadagi,5,This book is so delightful. Covers various aspects of our Universe indeed in a nutshell. The comedic timing of Stephen Hawking which is his signature writing style kept the pace going nicely. All the way from Einstein's ground breaking relativity papers to 11 dimensional worlds. I enjoyed it.
824,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5173917-barbara,1,"I tried to read it, thinking I would understand more about the universe, but I had to abandon it after several attempts to get into it. Turns out that I just don't care that much about physics even if Hawking tried so hard to encapsulate it in a nutshell for me. "
825,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91093175-ella,3,Was interesting but difficult to understand and follow. I need to read it again in physical copy to take time and reread and look up concepts. I was only able to grasp a couple general ideas from the audiobook 
826,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32841020-babak,2,It was way beyond expectations and pretty complicated especially for those who are not familliar with physics.his previuos books are essential to understand this book.I dont recommend it for folks want to put their first step into midern physics.

828,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938563-lawanda,3,This book would bring me up to date “...on all the developments in cosmological theory....”.

829,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40437908-husam-starxin,4,"A little bit outdated, but still very relevant to today's physics. It's certainly a good read for those interested in challenging themselves with a bit of a theoretical physics that's being read in simple words."
830,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66600818-dan,5,"Exquisite and sprinkled with Hawking's humor.I must add that the subject of this book has nothing to do with the new New Age babbling and rhetoric, that is just pick choose and twist for the purpose of picking choosing and twisting minds to dumb to understand at least a fraction and too full of themselves to admit it.Many of the modern physics hypothesis are derived not necessarily in a classic measurable experimental way but by the prediction and fitness to a mathematical construction or model."
831,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101632779-racheal-amador,5,"One of the greatest thinkers of the 21th century, Stephen Hawking briefly explores the event horizon and life cycles of black holes, worm holes that could carry one through time and space, and a multitude of other dimensions in this thought-provoking novel."
832,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7996974-steve359,4,"This is a fascinating book. It's too bad that I'm not smart enough to understand even the ""Layman's"" explanations. Still a very worthwhile read. It gives a peek at the vast wonder that is the universe."

834,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27789943-glenn-bellamy,3,"The first two chapters were easy for me to understand. Even after having read two of Hawkins other books, It was very difficult to wrap my head around the remaining 5 chapters. The glossary helped clarify some of the statements/ theories."
835,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908797-amanda,4,Prof Hawking is a brilliant scientist but “A brief history of time” is better. The chapters aren’t logically built upon each other and the theories aren’t well-explained from first principles and are instead stated as facts. What results is that the reader gets lost between statements and observations as there are missing links that are not explained.
836,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87066355-ilse-bleeker,5,"Although I understood maybe half of it, mr. Hawking succeeded in explaining the theories in such a way that it was understandable and readable. I like his humour too. Really enjoyed & learned a lot! Would recommend"
837,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34120564-judy,3,"I am sure that Stephan Hawking thought that this was simplified for the public, but it is very difficult to get your head around. It did explain some things and the graphics were lovely. But a very tough read. "
838,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51838463-anders-winther,3,"Once again a well written book, although a bit more complicated than A Brief History of Time, which, after all, wasn't exactly childrens litterature. But definitely a great read and a bit of a mind-blower."
839,055380202X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108014499-benjamin,3,I got lost in the second chapter and I’m not sure I understood the majority of what I read. Stephen Hawking had a great sense of humor and it shows through this book even if the topics fly over your head.
